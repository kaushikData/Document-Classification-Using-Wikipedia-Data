{{DISPLAYTITLE:"''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''" trial in Russia}}
[[Image:Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Russian).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Color image of the Russian edition of Bhagavad Gita As It Is front cover|The Russian edition of ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'', which was put on trial in [[Tomsk]].]]
The '''''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''''' '''trial in Russia''' was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'' (1968), a translation and commentary of the [[Hindu]] holy text, ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', on charges of [[religious extremism]]. It contains a translation and commentary by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.

The trial was initiated in June 2011 in [[Tomsk, Russia]], based on an assessment of the book by scholars of [[Tomsk State University]], which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as "patently absurd" undertaking of "ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Premier [[Vladimir Putin]] for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for [[India-Russia relations]] and for Russia's international reputation.

In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was included in the 2011 annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]]  of the [[U.S. Department of State]] among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

The court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' commissioned by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]].&lt;ref name=US-DS /&gt; Its authors, three professors of [[Tomsk State University]],  Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]]'s commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' contain "signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction",&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest&gt;{{Cite web|title=Перевод священного писания кришнаитов проверят на экстремизм|trans-title=Translation of the sacred Krishna scriptures to be tried for extremism|url=http://www.ria.ru/inquest/20110831/427685043.html|author=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; and foster "social discord", "gender, race, nationality, and language" discrimination.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; In addition to this, it was alleged to contain "calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups".&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Первый зам генпрокурора, высказавшийся по суду над "Бхагавад-гитой", недостаточно информирован, считают юристы, участвовавшие в процессе|trans-title=Lawyers: First Deputy Prosecutor General insufficiently informed to comment on the trial of the "Bhagavad-gita"|url=http://www.newsru.com/religy/17feb2012/bhagavad.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=17 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-tomsk&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска подала апелляцию на решение суда о "Бхагавад-гите"|trans-title=The Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal of Tomsk court's decision on the "Bhagavad Gita"|url=http://newsru.com/religy/26jan2012/tomsk.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=26 January 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска настаивает на экстремистском характере "Бхагавад-гиты" и подала апелляцию|trans-title=The prosecutor's office in Tomsk insists on an extremist nature "Bhagavad Gita" and filed an appeal"|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2012/01/26/n_2180377.shtml|newspaper=[[Gazeta.ru]]|date=January 26, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First, second, and third hearings (August 2011)===

In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt; According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security]] officer Dmitry Velikotsky.&lt;ref name=F18&gt;{{cite news|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=RUSSIA: Has "madness" of banning religious publications been stopped?|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1652|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[Forum 18]]|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite news|last=Попова|first=Анна|title=На поле дхармы|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/21/bhagavadgita/|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' did not contain any extremist statements.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the [[Bible]], like: "Don't throw [[wikt:cast pearls before swine|pearls before swine]]".&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of [[Kemerovo State University]], including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov.&lt;ref name=lenta /&gt; They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not.&lt;ref name=F18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS&gt;{{cite news|author=[[ITAR-TASS]]|script-title=ru:Томский суд отказался признать "Бхагавад-гиту" экстремистской|trans-title=Tomsk court refused to recognize the "Bhagavad Gita" as extremist|date=28 December 2011|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/308329.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.&lt;ref name=TOI-SPD&gt;{{cite news|title=As Hindus rally, Russia court defers Gita verdict|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111230042909/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=20 December 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal (March 2012)===
On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned,&lt;ref name=TOI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/europe/30666187_1_gita-verdict-social-discord-and-hatred-appeal|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-APP&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban Only Russian Comment in Hindu Holy Book – Prosecutors |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120216/171341942.html |accessdate=16 February 2012 |date=16 February 2012 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asking for more time.&lt;ref name=ET-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian prosecutors to move higher court seeking Gita ban |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/russian-prosecutors-to-move-higher-court-seeking-gita-ban/articleshow/11640077.cms|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=26 January 2012}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as "extremist literature."&lt;ref name=firstpost1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/gita-verdict-russian-prosecutors-planning-to-file-appeal-194858.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The First Post]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and "semantic distortions."&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;

The prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, "When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond".&lt;ref name=RASPI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor's office appeals adverse judgment in Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120126/259796779.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=1 February 2012|agency=RASPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal in Bhagavad Gita case to be heard in March|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120214/260191734.html|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=RAPSI (Russian Legal Information Agency)|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later rescheduled for March 20.&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, "it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason." Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, "That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court".&lt;ref name=RIA-APP /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-proc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/religy/16feb2012/bhagavad.html|script-title=ru:В Генпрокуратуре считают, что дело "Бхагавад-гиты" представляется в обществе искаженно|trans-title=The prosecutor's office believes that the "Bhagavad Gita" case is distorted in the community|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=16 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the [[Interfax]] office in Tomsk, [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult]] activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]] stated that the "manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors' complaints in Bhagavad Gita book case legitimate – expert|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9088|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the appeal, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), along with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), stated that they would fight "internationally" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Iskcon to fight against ban attempt on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-23/bhubaneswar/31090291_1_bhagavad-gita-ban-attempts|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal of appeal (March 2012)===
Representative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of "extremism" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.&lt;ref name=Echo-Moskvy&gt;{{cite news|title=Томский суд вновь отказал прокуратуре в запрете книги "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[Echo Moskvy]]|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/870830-echo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Суд в Томске вновь отказался признать экстремистской книгу "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[NEWSru]]|url=http://newsru.com/religy/21mar2012/bhagavad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition.&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDTVxx&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court dismisses plea seeking ban on Gita|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/russian-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-ban-on-gita-188254|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=21 March 2012|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors won't contest court refusal to declare 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' extremist|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120529/263289348.html|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Russian Legal Information Agency|date=29 May 2012|agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, [[Sushma Swaraj]], leader of the largest opposition party [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] demanded that the Indian government declare the ''Bhagavad Gita'' a "national book".&lt;ref name=HT-NB&gt;{{cite news|title=Declare Bhagavad Gita as national book, demands BJP|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, [[Tarun Vijay]], who asked rhetorically  "Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?"&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; Members across party lines voiced their support.&lt;ref name=HT-NB/&gt;  [[Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha]] [[K.

On December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief [[Vijay Jolly]] met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's "pain and anguish" at the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial and demand that "suitable measures" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that "[[India–Russia relations]] is of paramount importance to both countries". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy  a copy of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' to [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of "sublime thoughts" that "preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties".&lt;ref name=Outlook-BJP&gt;{{cite news|title=Take Steps to Withdraw Gita Case: BJP to Russia|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616082341/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|archive-date=16 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in [[Kolkata]], holding up copies of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=Prusty|first=Nigam|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/uk-india-russia-idUKTRE7BI0W620111219|title=Hold India uproar at call in Russia to ban Hindu holy book|work=[[Reuters]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protest marches were held in [[New Delhi]]&lt;ref name=HT-GKG&gt;{{cite news|last=Arora|first=Rajat|title=ISKCON: If Gita is banned, we’ll intensify protest|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=20 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221010708/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|archive-date=21 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chandigarh]].&lt;ref name=TOI-On&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/chandigarh/30537527_1_bhagawad-gita-signatures-petition|title=Bhagawad Gita on trial gathers online support|last=Negi|first=Himanshi|date=December 20, 2011|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]], ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]]er for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, "I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court".&lt;ref name=HT-GKG /&gt;

On December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he  condemned  "Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Manjari|title=Darul Uloom Deoband urges Hindus, Muslims to unite on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/india/30546086_1_darul-uloom-deoband-hindus-muslims|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism "totally baseless and highly objectionable",&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt; maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience "enshrined" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the "Russian highhandedness".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;
Maulana Khalid Rashid,  head of [[Firangi Mahal]], another Islamic center of higher education in [[Lucknow]],  also condemned what he called "Russian arrogance" and called on Muslims to support  Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government "to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;

On December 22, 2011,  [[Isai Mahasangh]] organization representing  Christians in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] addressed the [[President of India]] [[Pratibha Patil]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI]], asking for their intervention in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor [[Ram Naresh Yadav]], and to the Pope through the [[Holy See]] embassy in [[New Delhi]]. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that  "the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians".&lt;ref name=Hindu-Chr&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahim Pratap|title=Christians in MP oppose proposed Russian ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2738302.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent Hindu teacher [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]] in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia "an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia" and, countering accusations of the book of "extremism" and "intolerance"  opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.&lt;ref name=DB-NET&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita ban: Outrage grows as sales soar|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/NAT-TOP-bhagvad-gita-ban-outrage-grows-as-sales-soar-2660886.html?HT4=|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu activists====
On December 20, 2011, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)]] threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary [[Pravin Togadia]] said in a statement that the ''Bhagavad Gita'' is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and "touch humanity so very deeply", citing [[Albert Einstein]]'s fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia.&lt;ref name=AA-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP threatens Russian establishments with retaliation if Gita is banned|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/vhp-threatens-russian-establishments-retaliation-if-gita-banned-632|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Asian Age]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the [[Russian consulate in Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Kates|first=Glenn|title=In Russia, the Bhagavad Gita has a date in court|url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/in-russia-the-bhagavad-gita-has-a-date-in-court/|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VHP and [[Bajrang Dal]] activists also staged protest in [[Chandigarh]], calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of [[Hindus in Russia]] and denouncing the proposed ban.&lt;ref name=DB-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Bajrang Dal protest against bid to ban Bhagwad Gita|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/PUN-NEWS-vhp-bajrang-dal-protest-against-bid-to-ban-bhagwad-gita-2657671.html?LHS-|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, dozens of activists of [[Rashtrawadi Sena]], a hardline Hindu group,  burned a [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in [[New Delhi]] over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the ''Gita'' "the most pious book of the nation" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the ''Bhagavad Gita''  a "national scripture" in order to prevent such insults in the future.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion or extremism?

====Atheists and rationalists====
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], the president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the [[Tarksheel Society]], also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.&lt;ref name=atheist/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dalit]] [[Marxist]] scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheists, rationalists oppose ban on Bhagwat Gita|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-23/news/30550973_1_ban-iskon-bhagwat-gita|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian community in Goa====

On December 21, 2011,  the Russian community in [[Goa]] has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa [[Vikram Varma]] stated: "The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians in Goa flay possibility of ban on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/goa/30545829_1_russian-consulate-russian-city-goa|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Society====
The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from  all over the world, mostly from India.&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;

The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the [[hashtag]] #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; Noted poet and lyricist [[Javed Akhtar]], for instance, twitted: "Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;&lt;ref name=Link&gt;{{cite news|title=Should Bhagavad Gita be India’s National Book?|url=http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=12828|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=The Link|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member of Parilament [[Naveen Jindal]] wrote in his blog, "I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the ''Bhagavad Gita'' controversy".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; [[Janata Dal]] party leader [[Subramanian Swamy]] wrote on Twitter: "Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?"&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; and  Bollywood celebrity [[Farah Khan]] suggested in a retweet: "The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;

Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3&gt;{{cite news|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|title=Bhagavad Gita ban:Three views, three solutions|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-debate-bhagavad-gita-ban/20111223.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Rediff News|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A vocal anti-fundamentalist [[Ram Puniyani]] of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita'' translation "irrational",&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;  Former president of the [[Students Islamic Movement of India]] Shahid Badr Falahi said he was "completely against"&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; this or any other bans of religious books, calling on  "equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; [[Ram Madhav]], national executive member of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]  termed the attempted ban "a shameful act"  planned by some "fundamentalist groups in Russia" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a "terror manual".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;

===In Russia===
The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

====Indian diaspora and ISKCON====
Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; On November 1, ISKCON leader in India [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]] appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;  Hindu followers in Russia from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nepal]] and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the [[Hindu Council of Russia]] meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected [[Sadhu Priya Das]], and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman.  Das said that  they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that "finally the truth will prevail".&lt;ref name=STAT-BAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman /&gt;

ISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTx/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNLx /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-reject&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court rejects bid to ban "Bhagavad-Gita"|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/28/tomsk_court_rejects_the_bid_to_ban_bhagavad-gita_14108.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-bilateral&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita in court: Overcoming unexpected roadblock to relationship|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/10/bhagavad_gita_in_court_overcoming_unexpected_roadblock_to_bilateral_14141.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholars====
[[Islamic studies]] scholar [[Roman Silantyev]] opined that  Prabhupada's interpretation "has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.&lt;ref name=Interfax-MID&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper&amp;nbsp;– ministry|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8941|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', scientists and members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations."&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the [[Institute of High Humanitarian Studies]] at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers "have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref name=RT /&gt;

Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the ''Bhagavad Gita'', which "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism  against Prabhupada's "copious" commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are fallacious and based on a "primitive" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as "fool," "enemy," "demon, "kill"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when  "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy  book to ''Mein Kampf'', should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, "people will again start being burned alive".&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the ''Gita'' was "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' Volodin replied that "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".&lt;ref name=RIR-Volodin&gt;{{cite news|last=Volodin|first=Andrei|title=Gita row: A test of Russian toleration|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/gita_row_a_test_of_russian_toleration_14077.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government====
In an interview by ''[[CNN-IBN]]'', Russia's ambassador to India [[Alexander Kadakin]] called ''Bhagavad Gita'' "the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world."

He assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the ''Bhagavad Gita'' scandal and added that he thought it "categorically inadmissible" to take any sacred scriptures "for examination to ignorant people" to the courts  rather than to academic forums&lt;ref name=IE-RU&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia expresses sadness over Bhagwad Gita controversy|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/russia-expresses-sadness-over-bhagwad-gita-controversy/889960/0|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=KadTOI /&gt; Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still "can do something" and called the instigators of the trial "madmen", whose "madness should be stopped."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it "has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;

On December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban.&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK&gt;{{cite news|title=Krishna discusses Bhagavad Gita row with Russian ambassador|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-27/india/30560871_1_court-in-tomsk-city-bhagavad-gita-nerpa|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 December 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia "to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that "no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court".&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK /&gt;

According to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also "expressed regrets" about the situation.&lt;ref name=Hindu-LS /&gt;

Russian [[Ombudsman|Chief Director]] for [[Human rights in Russia|Human Rights]] [[Vladimir Lukin]] stated that the attempt to ban ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' amounted to "infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness"&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=India asks Russia to drop the case against Gita translation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2731900.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was "unacceptable" to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a "globally respected book".&lt;ref name=Statesman&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita ban: Russian court suspends verdict till 28 Dec|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108011714/http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|archivedate=8 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name=TheHindu-MID&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Gita ban: Russia rejects India's complaints|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2741599.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: "In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C.

The book was translated into Russian in 1984.

Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial "absurd". Speaking on the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'' radio station, she said, "This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years."  She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to "violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith." &lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

The court case  evoked protests by US-based [[Hindu]] activists, who called the trial "an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire [[Hindu]] community."&lt;ref name=YahooNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/hindus-upset-bhagavad-gita-ban-attempt-russian-city-095924009.html|title=Hindus upset at Bhagavad Gita ban attempt by Russian city|work= [[Asian News International|ANI]]|publisher = [[Yahoo!

Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors "indefensible" and "a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia".
Shukla added that, "[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society".&lt;ref name=HAF /&gt; HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government "to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens". They also warned that "Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world".&lt;ref name=HAF&gt;{{cite news|last=Jha|first=Lalit K.|title=Hindus in US outraged at attempts to ban Gita in Russia|url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5694646|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=[[MSN News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, [[Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal]], condemned the proposed ban, urging the [[Politics of Nepal|government]] and the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Parliament]] to support the ''Bhagavad Gita''. Chairman of the Dharma Sabha [[Madhav Bhattarai]] also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal.&lt;ref name=HimTimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Dharma Sabha Nepal denounces ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Dharma+Sabha+Nepal+denounces+ban+on+Gita&amp;NewsID=313585|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the ''Gita'' "guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.&lt;ref name=HimTimes2&gt;{{cite news|title='Bhagwat Gita is not extremist literature'|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline='Bhagwat+Gita+is+not+extremist+literature'&amp;NewsID=313597&amp;a=3|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] in its annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]] for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of  "selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that  "the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith".&lt;ref name=US-DS&gt;{{cite web|last=[[United States Department of State]]|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2011|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193067.pdf|publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholars===
{{Wikinews|Russian scholars call on Medvedev and Putin to defend Bhagavad Gita}}
On February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference ''Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society'' at the Tomsk State University.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita case perplex scientists|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120224/260445972.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=RAPSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they were "perplexed" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the ''Bhagavad Gita as It Is'' declared extremist. [[Chief researcher]] of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], indologist [[Irina Glushkova]] said in an interview with ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' that there are various schools of Hinduism "and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary", adding that "from this point of view ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office".&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt; She also stated it was "impermissible" to subject the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' to a criminal court trial, because "it is inseparable from the original ''Bhagavad Gita'', both being parts of the same culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Рассматривать "Бхагавад-гиту как она есть" с точки зрения Уголовного кодекса - недопустимо, утверждают ученые|trans-title=Scholars: It's impermissible to view the Bhagavad Gita As It Is via the Criminal Code|url=http://www.interfax-russia.ru/Siberia/report.asp?id=295556|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosopher [[Tatyana Lyubimova]], chief researcher of the [[Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], said that most ancient scriptures, including the ''Bhagavad Gita'', were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[Oriental studies|orientologists]], and [[philology|philologists]] published an open letter addressing both [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] and [[President-elect]] [[Vladimir Putin]], with copies sent to Russia's [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Presecutor General]], [[Ministry of Justice of Russia|Ministry of Justice]], and [[Public Chamber]], urging the ruling tandem to take the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' court case under their "personal control".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Russian scholars' plea on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2999643.ece|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsru-20&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Российские ученые просят Медведева и Путина взять процесс над "Бхагавад-гитой" под личный контроль|trans-title=Russian scholars ask Medvedev and Putin to take "Bhagavad Gita" court case under their personal control|url=http://newsru.com/religy/15mar2012/bhagavad.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=15 March 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as "untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Bengali Vaishnavism]], "one of the most popular branches of Hinduism",&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; and "did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial "discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

===ISKCON===
Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]], said that the commentary to ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' is "a precise and clear reflection" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-[[acharya]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us", said [[Ajai Malhotra]], Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name=RIR-Mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court dismisses Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/03/21/tomsk_court_dismisses_bhagavad_gita_case_15204.html|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible.

On April 11, 2012 [[Vladimir Lukin]], the [[Human Rights]] [[Commissioner]] of Russia, "warned against court decisions on ''Bhagavad Gita'' texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations." Lukin stated that the "Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s." Lukin noted that "[[Winston Churchill]] once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it."&lt;ref name=dailymail-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns Gita rulings should be up to experts|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2128403/Russian-ombudsman-warns-Gita-rulings-experts.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 April 2012|location=London|first=Dadan|last=Upadhyay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns on Gita rulings|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/russian-ombudsman-warns-on-gita-rulings/1/184131.html|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita Texts Up for Experts to Judge - Russian Ombudsman|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120411/172744774.html|newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religions====
On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council [[Roman Silantyev]] said that the examination of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' as extremist was accurate, and that "it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism."

He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with "extremely nasty reputation" and condemned their [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|charitable food distribution programs]] saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.&lt;ref name=IFSil&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court didn't find "Bhagavad Gita" translation extremist|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8953|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=28 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a "destructive cult" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It''.  [[Mufti]] Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, 
"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to "pay the debt" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable  food distribution by "delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites".&lt;ref name=IF-Mus&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Muslims believe Krishnaites a sect and ready to deliver them Halal meat|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8986|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=18 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Siberian prosecutors make another attempt to ban Prabhupada’s Gita interpretation|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/26/siberian_prosecutors_make_another_attempt_to_ban_prabhupadas_gita_in_14630.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as "fortunately" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal /&gt;

On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', which they called an "anti-Russian … disgraceful act" and "one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orthodox believers conveyed a batch of tinned stewed meat to Moscow Krishnaites in protest against burning Russian flag|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9015|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is "misinformed" and "exerting pressure" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because "there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet".&lt;ref name=IF-Bud&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:В буддийской общине РФ выступают против строительства храма кришнаитов в Москве|trans-title=The Buddhist community of Russia spoke against the construction of Krishna temple in Moscow|url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=44000|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Acerbo Law''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Election|electoral]] law proposed by Baron [[Giacomo Acerbo]] and passed by the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in November 1923. The purpose of it was to give [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] [[National Fascist Party|party]] a majority of deputies. The law was used only in the [[Italian general election, 1924|1924 general election]], which was the last competitive election held in Italy until 1946.

==Background==
In 1922, Italian Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] became the leader of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] as a result of the [[March on Rome]]. However, he still only had 35 deputies in Parliament and 10 Nationalist allies. He was in a weak position and relied on the [[coalition]] with other parties that could easily unravel and force [[King of Italy|King]] [[Victor Emmanuel III]] to dismiss him. The idea was to change the voting system from [[proportional representation]] to a system which would allow Mussolini to have a clear majority.

== Terms of the law ==
The Acerbo Law stated that the party gaining the ''largest share'' of the votes&amp;nbsp;– provided they had gained at least 25 percent of the votes&amp;nbsp;– gained ''two-thirds of the seats'' in parliament. The remaining third was shared amongst the other parties [[Proportional representation|proportionally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

==Reasoning==
Mussolini could only count on the support of 35 Fascist deputies and 10 Nationalists. The law was passed on a majority vote. The obvious question is why a majority of deputies from other parties voted for the law knowing that one way or another Mussolini would gain the 25% required. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] voted against it but made no effort to coordinate other parties to oppose it. The [[Italian People's Party (1919)|PPI or Popolari]] were divided and leaderless after Mussolini had engineered the dismissal of [[Luigi Sturzo]]. The official policy was to abstain but 14 deputies voted for the measure. The smaller Liberal parties generally voted in favour. They lacked clear direction and many believed Mussolini's talk of strong government or hoped to keep their positions. There is no doubt that  the presence of armed [[squadristi]] in the Chamber intimidated many into voting for the measure.

==The 1924 election==
An [[Italian general election, 1924|election]] was held straight afterwards under the new rules. The result has to be viewed with some suspicion given widespread violence, intimidation and vote rigging. His opponents were demoralised and unable to put up any coordinated opposition. Also many of the new Fascist deputies were ex-Liberal deputies who commanded a substantial personal following especially in the South.&lt;ref name="DeGrand1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = DeGrand | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany | publisher = Routledge | date = 1995 | location = New York, New York | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9QVL9LcEfjUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Acerbo+Law  | isbn = 0-415-10598-6 | page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Act on the Institute of National Remembrance &amp;ndash; Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation''' ({{lang-pl|"Ustawy o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej - Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu"}}) is a 1998 Polish law that created the [[Institute of National Remembrance]].  This [[memory laws|memory law]] was amended twice, in 2007 and 2018.

The 1998 Act's Article 55 criminalizes [[historical negationism]] of crimes committed against Poles or Polish citizens by [[Nazi]] or [[Communist]] [[polities]]; of [[crimes against peace]] or [[crimes against humanity|humanity]]; of [[war crimes]]; and of [[political repression]]—all these being listed in Sections 1a and 1b of Article 1.  While [[Holocaust denial]] is not ''explicitly'' mentioned, it is understood to be ''implicity'' criminalized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkI4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162|title=Memory Laws, Memory Wars: The Politics of the Past in Europe and Russia|last=Koposov|first=Nikolay|date=2017-10-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108329538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 amendment dealt with [[lustration in Poland|lustrations conducted in Poland]].

The 2018 amendment made further changes, including the addition of Article 55a, which makes it a crime to "ascribe [[Nazi crimes]] to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State"; and Article 2a, concerning crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by [[Ukrainian nationalists]]. The amendment caused an international controversy.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/01/polands-senate-passes-holocaust-complicity-bill-despite-concerns-from-u-s-israel/|title=Poland’s Senate passes Holocaust complicity bill despite concerns from U.S., Israel|last=Noack|first=Rick|date=2018-02-01|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998 act==
{{main|Institute of National Remembrance}}
The Institute of National Remembrance was established by a Sejm Act of 18 December 1998.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/1/2/|title=Institute of National Remembrance – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation|first=Institute of National|last=Remembrance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 55 ===
The Act's article 55 criminalized "public denial, against the facts, of [[Nazi crimes]], [[communist crimes]], and other offenses constituting [[crimes against peace]], [[crimes against humanity]] or [[war crimes]], committed against persons of Polish nationality or against Polish citizens of other nationalities between 1 September 1939 and 31 July 1990";&lt;ref&gt;[[Poland|Republic of Poland]], ''Dziennik ustaw z 2016 roku, poz. 1575'' (''Register of Statutes'', 2016, item 1575)&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore sometimes restrictively referred to as the "law against [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name= rpan&gt;Rafal Pankowski,

In 1999 an [[Opole University]] history professor, [[Dariusz Ratajczak]], was tried under Article 55 for his [[Holocaust denial]], was found guilty, and was sentenced to a year's probation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Kwiet]], [[Jürgen Matthäus]], ''Contemporary Responses to the Holocaust'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, {{ISBN|0-275-97466-9}}, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://auschwitz.org/en/museum/news/guilty-of-holocaust-denial-negligible-public-harm,227.html|title=News / Museum / Auschwitz-Birkenau|last=www.auschwitz.org|website=auschwitz.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 amendment==
The 2007 amendment dealt with [[lustration in Poland|lustrations conducted in Poland]].

==2018 amendment==
{{undue weight section|date=March 2018}}
{{POV section|date=June 2018}}
The 2018 amendment, intended "to eliminate public misattribution to the Polish Nation or the Polish State of responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the [[German Third Reich]]", was signed into law by [[Andrzej Duda|President Andrzej Duda]] on 6 February 2018. The Amendment will come into force in 3 months after its signing.

Article 55a, referred to by critics variously as the "Polish Holocaust bill", the "Poland Holocaust law", etc., has caused international controversy.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  Critics fear that Article 55a poses an obstacle to free discussion of historical facts about [[the Holocaust in Poland]].

Article 2a, dealing with crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by [[Ukrainian nationalists]], caused controversy in [[Ukraine]].

=== History  ===
A 2006 law with some of the same aims, Article 132a of the [[Polish Penal Code]], was passed in 2006, but was invalidated in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After a period of lobbying, the first version of the 2018 Amendment was drafted on 17 February 2016 by [[Ministry of Justice (Poland)|Minister of Justice]] [[Zbigniew Ziobro]]. On 30 August 2016 the [[Council of Ministers (Poland)|Council of Ministers]], presided over by Prime Minister [[Beata Szydło]], forwarded the draft to the [[Sejm]].
&lt;ref name="tr2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislacja.rcl.gov.pl/projekt/12282660|title=Projekt|website=legislacja.rcl.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal rationale given at the submission of the first draft was that diplomatic and public interventions against use of the misleading term "Polish death camp" and the like had proven ineffective. Therefore, it had been decided to create a legal instrument for "counteracting the falsification of Polish history and for protecting the good name of Polish citizens." Thus a new type of crime had been defined, "consisting in the attribution to Polish citizens, in public and against the facts, of the organizing, participation in, or responsibility or co-responsibility for crimes committed by Nazi Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislacja.rcl.gov.pl/docs//2/12282660/12339392/12339393/dokument210290.pdf|title=Draft Amendment, February 17, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was immediately criticized internationally as an attempt to suppress discussion of crimes that had been committed during the Holocaust by Polish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/poland-approves-bill-outlawing-phrase-polish-death-camps |title=Poland approves bill outlawing phrase 'Polish death camps' |agency=Associated Press |date=16 August 2016 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/17/obama-once-referred-to-a-polish-death-camp-in-poland-that-could-soon-be-punishable-by-3-years-in-prison/ |title=Obama once referred to a 'Polish death camp.'

Journalist Jerzy Haszczyński, writing in the Polish newspaper ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'', observed that, when the expression "Polish death camp" appeared in foreign media, it "insidiously suggested that our state and our people were responsible for German crimes"; but he was not sure whom the proposed law would affect.  "Almost every use of the expression that I can recall ended in a profuse apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/print/786/45744/article |title=We didn't build the death camps |first=Jerzy |last=Haszczyński |date=2 September 2016 |work=The Week |accessdate=4 September 2016 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rp.pl/Komentarze/308169898-Haszczynski-Watpliwa-kara-za-polskie-obozy.html |title=Wątpliwa kara za 'polskie obozy' |language=Polish |trans-title=Questionable Punishment for 'Polish Camps' |first=Jerzy |last=Haszczyński |date=16 August 2016 |work=Rzeczpospolita |accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of the "ban of [[propaganda]] of Banderism"  to the law (Article 2a) was spearheaded by the right-wing political movement [[Kukiz'15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/54261/Sejm-uchwalil-ustawe-o-penalizacji-banderyzmu.html|title=Sejm uchwalił ustawę o penalizacji banderyzmu|first=|last=DoRzeczy.pl|date=26 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kukiz'15 submitted this addition on July 16, 2016, however it was blocked by [[Civic Platform]] and [[Law and Justice]] parties citing "the good of Polish-Ukrainian relations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/35189/Kukiz-oskarza-kierownictwo-PiS-o-uleglosc-wobec-spadkobiercow-Bandery.html "Kukiz oskarża kierownictwo PiS o uległość wobec spadkobierców Bandery"], ''[[Do Rzeczy]]'', June 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Article 2a was added to the bill on 25 January 2018 during the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/druk.xsp?nr=993-A Druk nr 993-A, "Additional Report..."], January 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2018, after the bill's third reading, the Polish Parliament's lower chamber, the [[Sejm]], approved the bill,&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018"&gt;{{cite web| last1 =Parliament of Poland| first1 =| last2 =| first2 =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Ustawa z dnia 26 stycznia 2018 r. o zmianie ustawy o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej – Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu, ustawy o grobach i cmentarzach wojennych, ustawy o muzeach oraz ustawy o odpowiedzialności podmiotów zbiorowych za czyny zabronione pod groźbą kary]| work =| publisher =Parliament of Poland| date =2018-01-29| url =http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/771_u/$file/771_u.pdf| format =[[PDF]]| doi =| accessdate =2018-02-02| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6wwITJ7NY?url=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/771_u/$file/771_u.pdf| archivedate =2018-02-02| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Art. 1}} which would apply to Poles as well as to foreigners. On 1 February 2018 the upper chamber, the Senate, passed the bill without amendment.  On 6 February 2018 [[Andrzej Duda|President Andrzej Duda]] signed the bill into law.&lt;ref name=noack/&gt;

Some parts of the law will come into effect 14 days after its registration in ''[[Dziennik Ustaw]]'' (the Register of Statutes), with the full law coming into effect within 3 months. The law is also being referred to [[the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] for review of its compliance with the [[Polish Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/07/europe/poland-holcaust-bill-signed-intl/index.html "Polish President signs controversial Holocaust bill into law"], ''CNN'', February 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was interpreted across Israel's political spectrum as promoting the denial of historic facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/world/middleeast/poland-holocaust-law-israel.html?mtrref=www.google.pl&amp;gwh=60D27DE29453356F59B959F3E1193EEF&amp;gwt=pay|title=Israel Slams ‘Baseless’ Holocaust Legislation in Poland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Israelis went so far as to accuse the Polish government of [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name="Selk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/27/it-could-soon-be-a-crime-to-blame-poland-for-nazi-atrocities-and-israel-is-appalled/|title=Analysis {{!}} It could soon be a crime to blame Poland for Nazi atrocities, and Israel is appalled|last=Selk|first=Avi|date=2018-01-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetandap"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5079364,00.html|title=Israeli politicians, survivors blast Polish Holocaust law|publisher=[[Ynet]] and [[Associated Press]]|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2018, the Polish government initiated an online propaganda effort supporting the law, using social media efforts to spread messages supporting the law, and broadcasting advertisements in [[Poland]] as well as [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]. Hashtags such as "#GermanDeathCamps" and "#PolishRighteousness" were spread by government accounts, and a viral video was made that is currently being spread via [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].

In a 24 February 2017 interview, Poland’s Justice Minister and Prosecutor-General [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] indicated that the law would not be enforced until it was cleared by the Constitutional Tribunal.  This was quickly misinterpreted by Israeli media as meaning that the law had been "frozen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Poland-says-controversial-Holocaust-law-isnt-frozen-543583 "POLAND SAYS CONTROVERSIAL HOLOCAUST LAW ISN'T 'FROZEN'"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an opinion poll conducted in February 2018, 51% of Poles opposed the 2018 amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/cbos-40-proc-polakow-jest-za-nowela-ustawy-o-ipn-51-proc-uwaza-ze-dezinformacji-nalezy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill summary===
According to a communiqué of the  [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], an example of such misattribution is the [["Polish death camp" controversy|use of expressions such as "Polish death camps]]". The communiqué further states:&lt;ref name=mfaco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.pl/en/news/communique_of_the_ministry_of_foreign_affairs_on_amendment_of_the_act_on_the_institute_of_national_remembrance_|title=Communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on amendment of the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance|website=www.mfa.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The amended act provides for a penalty, in precisely defined [circumstance]s, for the purpose of preventing intentional defamation of Poland. The final determination of a specific case will rest with the courts. 
 
The provisions of the amended act [shall] not limit freedom of research, discussion of history, or artistic activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed law modifies a previous law relating to the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (namely, the Act of 18 December 1998 on the  – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (Dz.U. 1998 nr 155 poz. 1016)).

The following additions caused most international controversy.

*About responsibility for Nazi crimes, two additions to Article 55:

:Article 55a:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. [Anyone] who, in public and against the facts, ascribes to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State, responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich, [as] defined in Article 6 of the [[Nuremberg Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal]], Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the [[Axis powers|European Axis]], signed in London on August 8, 1945 [...], or for other offences which are crimes against peace [or] humanity or [that are] war crimes, or who otherwise grossly reduces the responsibility of the actual perpetrators of said crimes, is subject to a fine or [to] imprisonment for up to 3 years. The judgment shall be made public.

2. If a perpetrator of the act referred to in paragraph 1 has acted unintentionally, [such person] shall be subject to a fine or [[community sentence]] [([[:pl:kara ograniczenia wolności|pl]])].

3. No offense referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall have been committed if the act was performed as part of artistic or scholarly activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:and Article 55b:&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Regardless of locally binding regulations at the place at which the forbidden act took place, this law applies to Polish citizens as well as to foreigners in the case that a crime occurs as described by Articles 55 and 55a.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*About crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and Ukraininan Nazi collaborators, 
:the added Article 2a:&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The crimes of [[Ukrainian nationalists]] and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich, as defined in the Act, are acts committed by Ukrainian nationalists in the years 1925-1950, involving the use of violence, terror or other forms of violation of human rights, against individuals or ethnic groups. One of the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich is their involvement in the extermination of the Jewish population and genocide on citizens of the Second Polish Republic in [[Volhynia]] and Eastern [[Lesser Poland]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:The above text refers to [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]] and to {{ill|ethnic cleansing in Eastern Lesser Poland|pl|Czystka etniczna w Małopolsce Wschodniej}} (''Note'':  Eastern Galicia and {{ill|Eastern Lesser Poland|pl|Małopolska Wschodnia}} overlapped substantially, but were not coterminous: Eastern Galicia was a part of Eastern Lesser Poland annexed by [[Habsburg Austria]] to the [[Austrian Partition]] of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Timothy Snyder]], [http://www.tygodnik.com.pl/numer/275719/snyder.htmlPięć wieków i osiem lat]; ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' – April 2002, an slightly abbreviated text of a conference presentation (Polish original).  English title: "Five Centuries and Eight Years: [[Operation Vistula]] and the homogeneity of Polish society"&lt;/ref&gt;)

The first addition caused international controversy and contributed to a worsening of [[Israel–Poland relations|Israel-Poland relations]].&lt;ref name="Selk" /&gt;

The second addition contributed to worsening of [[Poland-Ukraine relations]].&lt;ref name=spears&gt;[https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/byly-minister-obrony-ukrainy-ostrzega-ponad-milion-ukraincow-moze-chwycic-za-kopie-6217366961669761a "Były minister obrony Ukrainy ostrzega: ponad milion Ukraińców może chwycić za kopie"] "Former Ukrainian Minister of Defense Warns:  over a million Ukrainians may take up the cudgels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over Article 55a ===
{{main|"Polish death camp" controversy#Reactions}}

Article 55a was criticized for being an obstacle to free discussions of historical facts about the [[Holocaust in Poland]]. A letter signed by many prominent persons in early February, including [[Anne Appelbaum]] and the 3rd President of Poland [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], said: "Why should the victims and witnesses of the Holocaust have to watch what they say for fear of being arrested, and will the testimony of a Jewish survivor who “feared Poles” be a punishable offence?".&lt;ref name=aaak&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/05/polish-law-denies-reality-of-holocaust "Polish law denies reality of Holocaust"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before being passed, the law damaged the [[Israel–Poland relations]]. Israel's Foreign Ministry director-general [[Yuval Rotem]] reported that preserving the memory of the Holocaust takes priority over international relations. He said that "Preserving the memory of the Holocaust is a matter beyond the bilateral relationship between Israel and Poland. It is a core issue cutting to the essence of the Jewish people".&lt;ref name="target"/&gt; Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] accused Poland of Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Selk"/&gt; [[Yair Lapid]], a member of the Israeli Parliament, wrote on Twitter:

{{quote|I utterly condemn the new Polish law  which tries to deny Polish complicity in the Holocaust. It was conceived in Germany but hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered without ever meeting a German soldier.

Dr. [[Efraim Zuroff]], head of the Israel office of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], stated that, though he opposes the bill, Lapid's remarks were not factually correct:

[[Yad Vashem]] condemned the Polish bill, saying that, while "Polish death camps" as a phrase is a historic misrepresentation, the legislation is "liable to blur the historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population during the Holocaust".&lt;ref name="TOI20180127"&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/decrying-new-bill-yad-vashem-says-polish-death-camps-a-misrepresentation/ Yad Vashem: Poland Holocaust law risks ‘serious distortion’ of Polish complicity], Times of Israel, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/27/israel-criticises-poland-over-draft-holocaust-legislation Israel criticises Poland over draft Holocaust legislation], Guardian, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed out that, beyond mere complicity, Poles themselves massacred Jews in the 1941 [[Jedwabne pogrom]] and in the post-war 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]], among other incidents, and that the law would outlaw mention of these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-poland-leave-the-history-writing-to-historians-1.5768084 Analysis Poland Needs to Leave the Holocaust History Writing to Actual Historians], Haaretz, 28 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2018/01/27/news-opinion/world/poland-wants-to-ban-the-term-polish-death-camps-there-are-historical-inaccuracies-on-both-sides-of-the-debate Poland wants to ban the term ‘Polish death camps.’ There are historical inaccuracies on both sides of the debate.], JTA, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI20160818"&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/is-new-polish-law-an-attempt-to-whitewash-its-citizens-roles-in-the-holocaust/ Is new Polish law an attempt to whitewash its citizens’ roles in the Holocaust?], Times of Israel, 18 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; According to Israeli education minister [[Naftali Bennett]], "It is a historic fact that many Poles aided in the murder of Jews, handed them in, abused them, and even killed Jews during and after the Holocaust", and "It is also a historic fact that the Germans initiated, planned, and built the work and death camps in Poland. That is the truth, and no law will rewrite it."  Bennett instructed schools to teach about the Polish role in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-orders-more-holocaust-study-in-schools-including-polish-role-in-wwii/ Bennett orders more Holocaust study in schools, including Polish role in WWII], Times of Israel, 28 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] expressed "disappointment" in the bill, adding: "Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry."&lt;ref name=noack&gt;Rick Noack (6 February 2018): [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/06/polish-president-to-sign-holocaust-bill-despite-international-concerns/ "Polish president signs Holocaust bill, drawing rare U.S. rebuke"], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polish League Against Defamation]] filed a complaint against the Argentine newspaper [[Página/12]], a few hours after the amendment came into force. The complaint is about an article from December 2017, which illustrated the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] with a photo of the ''[[Cursed soldiers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-poland/polish-group-sues-argentine-paper-under-new-holocaust-law-idUSKCN1GF0RF|title= Polish group sues Argentine paper under new Holocaust law|author= |date= March 3, 2018|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the group, the article was "intended to harm the Polish nation and the good reputation of Polish soldiers" and "by issuing such a statement, the publisher showed great historical ignorance for which he should officially apologize to all Poles".&lt;ref name="target"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/International/Argentina-newspaper-first-target-of-controversial-Polish-Holocaust-law-544098|title= ARGENTINA NEWSPAPER FIRST TARGET OF CONTROVERSIAL POLISH HOLOCAUST LAW|author= EYTAN HALON|date= March 3, 2018|publisher= Jerusalem Post|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article had been published before the amendment of the law, and it is unclear how it would be enforced against foreign outlets.&lt;ref name="pagina"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story|title= Poland: group sues Argentinian newspaper under new Holocaust law|author= Christian Davies and Uki Goñi|date= March 5, 2018|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not address whether a retroactive enforcement of law was valid.&lt;ref name="target"/&gt; Página/12 reported that they had not been formally notified, and published interviews with [[Argentine Jew]]s that escaped from Poland during the Holocaust, such as Diana Wang, president of an organization that represents Holocaust survivors and their descendants in Argentina. Other Argentine newspapers showed their support by republishing the article. The secretary for Human Rights [[Claudio Avruj]] said that "No law can limit, condemn or prevent freedom of expression or limit research".&lt;ref name="pagina"/&gt;

[[Jeffrey Kopstein]] of the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Jason Wittenberg]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], authors of the book, ''Intimate Violence: Anti-Jewish Pogroms on the Eve of the Holocaust'', about anti-Jewish violence in Poland such as the [[Szczuczyn pogrom]], opine that the purpose of the new bill "is clear: to restrict discussion of Polish complicity."  They also  suggest that "Poland’s current government will likely face the unpalatable prospect of enforcing an unenforceable law and denying what the mainstream scholarly community has increasingly shown to be true:  Some Poles were complicit in the Holocaust.".&lt;ref name="KopsteinWittenberg" /&gt;

Prof. [[Stanislaw Krajewski]] of the Warsaw University, who co-chairs the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, said that "The way the law is formulated makes it a blunt instrument for paralysing and punishing anyone you don't like", and that "the government's harsh, dismissive reaction to critics has encouraged many people to think they can now attack Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/8727/polish-archbishop-answers-holocaust-law-critics |title=Polish archbishop answers Holocaust law critics |last=Luxmoore |first=Jonathan |date=2018-03-14 |work=The Tablet |access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2018, in front of the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw and Wrocław, 45 Polish citizens made public statements referring to historical events, including the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] and the [[Szczuczyn pogrom]]. The citizens claimed that they attributed responsibility for the events and alleged that their public statements constituted criminal acts under Article 55a of the amended Act of the Institute of National Memory. In the Prosecutors' offices, the citizens deposited formal written documents reporting their alleged crimes.&lt;ref name="OKOPress_selfaccused" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obywatelrp_selfaccused" /&gt;

In late March 2018, an Israeli mayor Eli Dukorsky of [[Kiryat Bialik]], who planned to deliver a speech during an event in Poland had been asked by local Polish municipal authorities to submit his speech in advance prior to its being delivered in the Israeli mayor's Polish [[sister city]], [[Radomsko]]. According to Dukorsky, subsequently Polish authorities were unwilling to accept portions of the speech that referred to Polish complicity in the Holocaust, in particular the estimate that Poles killed 200,000 Jews, and accounts from Holocaust survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Holocaust-memorial-ceremony-canceled-after-Poland-censors-Israeli-speech-545479 HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL CEREMONY CANCELED AFTER POLAND CENSORS ISRAELI SPEECH], ''Jerusalem Post'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://forward.com/fast-forward/396912/israeli-mayor-refuses-to-deliver-remarks-in-poland-censored-under-new/ Israeli Mayor Cancels Speech In Poland After Being Censored Under Holocaust Law], ''[[The Forward]]'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radomsko Mayor Jarosław Ferenc, "some of the content was historically unproven"; among other things, the claims that "Polish farmers killed 200,000 Jews during the war, and that of the six million Jews who were murdered, 200,000 were killed by Poles", were unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/polish-town-cancels-ceremony-with-sister-city-over-holocaust-mention-1.5917860 Polish Town Cancels Ceremony With Israeli Mayor Over Mention of Poles Murdering Jews], ''Haaretz'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some media reports have described this event as a ''de facto'' [[censorship]], and a [[chilling effect]] related to the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/world/israeli-mayor-forced-to-cancel-annual-speech-in-poland-over-country-s-new-holocaust-law-1.461002 Israeli mayor forced to cancel annual speech in Poland over country’s new Holocaust law], JC, 20 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lodz.wyborcza.pl/lodz/7,35136,23164282,prezydent-radomska-nie-pozwolil-przemawiac-burmistrzowi-z-izraela.html Prezydent Radomska cenzuruje burmistrza z Izraela.

In April 2018, Polish nationalists called for the investigation of Israeli president [[Reuven Rivlin]] for his remarks at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in which he reportedly told Polish president [[Andrzej Duda]] "that Poland allowed the implementation of Germany's genocide" according to [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement]] Vice President [[Krzysztof Bosak]]. According to Bosak, "it would be unacceptable if Rivlin asserted that Poland bears any responsibility for the Holocaust", with Bosak saying that his group was testing the enforcement of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/polish-nationalists-call-to-probe-rivlin-over-holocaust-remarks-1.6011170 Polish Nationalists Call to Investigate Israeli President Rivlin Over Holocaust Remarks], Haaretz, 17 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2018 the article was amended, making the offending statements civil, instead of criminal, offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44627129|title=Poland U-turn on Holocaust law|date=2018-06-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime ministers of Poland and Israel issued a joint declaration endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the expression, "Polish concentration camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/27/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-holocaust-law-the-latest.html|title=The Latest: Party Head: Israel Confirms Polish View on Nazis|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over Article 2a ===

The Amendment's passage worsened Polish-Ukrainian relations, already contentious on the questions of the prewar [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and the wartime and postwar [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13497">{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}Four airlines,  [[British Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Air New Zealand]] and [[Virgin Australia]], have attracted criticism for controversial seating policies which [[discriminate]] against adult male passengers [[Discrimination#Sex, gender, and gender identity discrimination|on the basis of their sex]]. The companies refused to allow unaccompanied children to be seated next to adult males on their flights, leading to criticism that they regard all men as a danger to children.

The policies resulted in protests against the airlines and criticism by [[civil liberties]] and children's charities. British Airways ended its policy in August 2010 following successful [[legal action]] undertaken by Mirko Fischer.

==British Airways==
In March 2001, it was revealed that [[British Airways]] had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to [[unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] (any person under the age of 15), even if the child's parents are elsewhere on the aircraft. This led to accusations that the airline considered all men to be potential [[paedophile]]s and women to be incapable of such abuse. The issue was first raised when a business executive had moved seats to be closer to two of his colleagues. A [[flight attendant]] then asked him to move because he was then sitting next to two unaccompanied children which was a breach of BA company policy. The executive said he felt humiliated as a result, stating "I felt I was being singled out and that I was being accused of something." British Airways admitted that staff were under instructions to keep men away from unaccompanied children whenever possible because of the dangers of male paedophiles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news  | last= Smith|first= Lewis | title = BA says men cannot sit with lone children| work = The Times | date = 16 March 2001  | url = http://www.vaeter-aktuell.de/english/British_Airways_-_Men_cannot_sit_with_lone_children_2001.pdf | accessdate = 5 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue again came to prominence in 2005 following complaints by Michael Kemp who had been instructed to swap seats with his wife when on a [[GB Airways]] flight. The flight attendant informed him that for an adult male stranger to be sitting next to a child was a breach of the airline's child welfare regulations. This case was considered the more unusual because the policy was applied even though the girl's parents were on board the flight. [[Michele Elliott]], director of the children's charity [[Kidscape]] stated that the rule "is utterly absurd. It brands all men as potential [[sex offenders]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Revealed: How BA bans men sitting next to children they don't know  | work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 4 November 2006  | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=414550&amp;in_page_id=1770 | accessdate = 21 November 2006 | location=London | first=Lucy | last=Farndon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 politician (and later [[London Mayor]]) [[Boris Johnson]], criticised the company after staff mistakenly attempted to separate him from his own children on a flight. He stated that those who create or defend such policies "fail to understand the terrible damage that is done by this system of presuming guilt in the entire male population just because of the tendencies of a tiny minority", linking such discrimination to the reduced number of male [[teachers]] and therefore lower [[Academic achievement|achievement in schools]]. Like others, Johnson also raised the policy's flaw in ignoring female abusers and branded airlines with such policies as "cowardly" for giving in to "[[Lunatic|loony]] hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Come off it, folks: how many paedophiles can there be?   | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 9 November 2006  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3634055/Come-off-it-folks-how-many-paedophiles-can-there-be.html | accessdate = 26 Sep 2014 | location=London | first=Boris | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways defended the policy, stating it had been implemented as a result of requests from customers. The company claimed that it "was responding to a fear of [[sexual assaults]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Court case===
In January 2010 businessman Mirko Fischer from [[Luxembourg]] sued the airline for sex discrimination following an incident where he was forced to change seats as a result of the policy, thus separating him from his pregnant wife. Fischer stated "I was made to feel like a [[criminal]] in front of other passengers. It was totally humiliating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1243625/Businessman-Mirko-Fischer-sues-British-Airwars-treating-men-like-perverts.html | accessdate = 20 February 2012 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Businessman sues BA 'for treating men like perverts' | first=Sophie | last=Borland | date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2010, Mr Fischer was successful in winning compensation from British Airways with the company sex discrimination in Mr Fischer's case. BA paid £2,161 in costs and £750 in damages which Fischer donated to child protection charities. In June 2010 BA said that the policy was under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10401416.stm | work=BBC News | title=BA payout over child seat policy | date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, it changed its policy and began seating unaccompanied children in a nondiscriminatory manner near the cabin crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7957982/British-Airways-changes-discriminatory-seating-policy-for-men.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=British Airways changes 'discriminatory' seating policy for men | first=Alastair | last=Jamieson | date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discontinuation===
In February 2016, British Airways announced the discontinuation of its “Unaccompanied Minor” (UM) service for children under 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/british-airways-stops-unaccompanied-minor-service-in-bid-to-cut-costs-a6895931.html | title=British Airways stops 'Unaccompanied Minor' service in bid to cut costs | work=[[The Independent]] | date=26 February 2016 | accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qantas and Air New Zealand==
In November 2005, it was revealed that [[Qantas]] and [[Air New Zealand]] have seating policies similar to that of British Airways. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when Mark Wolsay, who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand, was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that "it was the airline's policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10357510|title=Ban on men sitting next to children|date=29 November 2005|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|first=Ainsley|last=Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Wolsay, a shipping manager, stated he felt the policy "totally discriminatory", and the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' suggested to the airline that the implication of the policy was that "it considered male passengers to be dangerous to children". New Zealand's [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] stated that the policy was discriminatory and reported the matter to the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=NZHerald&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10357697 |title=Airline seating policy may breach Human Rights Acts|date=30 November 2005|work=The New Zealand Herald |first=Ainsley |last=Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On learning of the policies several protests occurred including a 22-hour tree top protest by double [[amputee]] Kevin Gill in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]. He stated that the policy could be the thin end of a wedge with men soon banned from sitting next to children at [[Spectator sport|sports events]] and on other forms of [[public transport]]. Gill also raised the issue of what would happen if the policy had been [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] based and targeted [[ethnic minorities]] rather than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707195419/http://www.fatherandchild.org.nz/News/2006/emale-feb06.pdf |title=Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publicity given to the issue in 2005 caused others to publicly describe their experiences. For example, [[Bethlehem, New Zealand|Bethlehem]] [[Firefighter|fire officer]] Philip Price revealed he had been forced to switch seats in 2002 on an Air New Zealand flight to [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Cameron Murphy, president of the [[NSW Council for Civil Liberties]], criticised the policy and stated that "there was no basis for the ban". He said it was wrong to assume that all adult males pose a danger to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20051130/pacific.htm |title=Ire at flight seating edict |date=30 November 2005 |publisher=Pacific News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616195216/http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20051130/pacific.htm |archivedate=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has also been criticised for failing to take female abusers into consideration as well as ignoring instances of [[Child-on-child sexual abuse|children who commit sex offences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

with others drawing parallels with the case of [[Rosa Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/node/17161|title=Commerce Secretary Defends 'Green' Investments Using Gambler's Logic|website=CNS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have defended the policy, with [[New South Wales]] Commissioner for Children and Young People Gillian Calvert stating that there were more male sex offenders than female and thus "in the absence of any other test, it's one way in which the airline can reduce the risk of children travelling alone". She believes that the likelihood of an attack was rare but not impossible claiming "it's only a few men who do this sort of stuff, but when they do it they diminish all men". Air New Zealand spokesman David Jamieson said the company had no intention of reviewing the policy and acknowledged that it had been in place for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/?c=ireland&amp;jp=cwmhcwgbqlmh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617014715/http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/?c=ireland&amp;jp=cwmhcwgbqlmh|archivedate=2009-06-17|title=Airlines' ban on men sitting with children 'may be unlawful' - IOL|date=17 June 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the controversy resurfaced when Daniel McLuskie, a nurse, had to swap seats with a female passenger on a Qantas flight after the crew noticed he was sitting next to an unrelated girl travelling alone. The person concerned felt discriminated and humiliated before the flight guests as a [[pedophile]].&lt;ref name="Nurse 'humiliated' by Qantas policy"&gt;: ''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/travel-troubles/7468866/Nurse-humiliated-by-Qantas-seating-policy Nurse 'humiliated' by Qantas policy]'', 13 August 2012, retrieved 28 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A Qantas spokesman defended the policy as consistent with that of other airlines in Australia and around the globe.&lt;ref name="Nurse 'humiliated' by Qantas policy"/&gt;

==Virgin Australia==
In 2012, it became public knowledge that [[Virgin Australia]] had also implemented this policy. Johnny McGirr, a 33-year-old firefighter from Sydney, was told to move seats by a Virgin flight attendant. When asked why, the flight attendant cited policy and told McGirr "you can't sit next to two unaccompanied minors." The attendant then asked a female passenger, "Can you please sit in this seat because he is not allowed to sit next to minors." A public backlash in Twitter prompted Virgin Australia to review its policy barring men from sitting beside unaccompanied children on flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Aaron|title=Should male passengers be allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/14/travel/unaccompanied-children-flights/index.html|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Autex Industries Ltd v Auckland City Council''''' [2000] NZAR 324  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the development of nuisance claims under [[Rylands v Fletcher]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As the result of an Auckland City Council water main breaking, the resulting flood destroyed $206,708.17 of stock owned by Autex.

After the council refused to reimburse them for the damaged stock, they sued the council. But instead of filing for the normal negligence claim, which the council would have surely defended, they instead brought a Rylands v Fletcher claim, where there is strict liability, i.e. no defence is normally arguable.

As it was a strict liability claim, they made an application for summary judgment.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that it was inappropriate to grant summary judgment here, and referred the matter back to court for argument.

==Legal Significance==
At the time, this case was expected to clarify the development of Rylands v Fletcher case law in New Zealand. However, the parties settled the claim before a court made a further ruling on this. This matter was clarified 2 years later in [[Hamilton v Papakura District Council]].

The term '''Bermuda Form''' refers to various types of [[insurance]] policies.

In the 1980s, American companies found it increasingly difficult to buy large amounts of [[Casualty insurance|casualty (liability) insurance]], partly because American courts interpreted policies in ways which gave coverage to policyholders which was wider than the insurers had anticipated, causing insurers large losses particularly in relation to [[asbestos]] and [[pollution]]. To meet the needs of corporate insurance buyers, new insurance companies were set up in [[Bermuda]], notably ACE, XL, and Starr Excess Casualty. Each of these insurers produced its own standard-form policy (which has been revised and re-issued over the years), and collectively these policies are loosely described as the "Bermuda Form".

Bermuda Form policies share certain similarities. For example, they exclude liability for asbestos and pollution. They also provide for multiple losses to be batched together into a single claim called an "Integrated Occurrence": batching claims in this way can allow a policyholder to make claims which would otherwise have been barred by the policy [[deductible]] (for example, in mass [[product liability]] litigation, each claim individually might be too small to exceed the deductible, but all claims taken together might exceed it).

Bermuda Form standard policy wordings stipulate that they are governed by [[New York law]] (but sometimes the parties agree to change this to Bermudian or another governing law). To reduce the perceived risks of the American jury system, the policies usually provide for disputes to be resolved by [[arbitration]], often in [[London]], and for punitive damages to be excluded. Bermuda Form arbitrations are confidential and therefore rarely reported; the case of C v. D ([2007] EWHC 1541 (Comm)) is an example of a Bermuda Form arbitration which was the subject of an appeal.

'''Bernhard Schlink''' (born 6 July 1944 in [[Bielefeld]]) is a German lawyer, academic, and novellist. He is best known for his novel ''[[The Reader]]'' which was first published in 1995 and became an international bestseller.

==Early life==
He was born to a German father ([[Edmund Schlink]]) and a Swiss mother, the youngest of four children. His mother, Irmgard, had been a theology student of his father, whom she married in 1938. (Edmund Schlink's first wife had died in 1936.) Bernhard's father had been a seminary professor and pastor in the [[Confessing Church]]. In 1935, he had been removed from his teaching position in Giessen for his public criticism of Nazi policies. In 1946, he became a professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at Heidelberg University, where he would serve until his retirement in 1971. Over the course of four decades Edmund Schlink became one of the most famous and influential Lutheran theologians in the world and a key participant in the modern Ecumenical Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Becker, “Edmund Schlink (1903-1984),” in Twentieth-Century Lutheran Theologians, ed. Mark Mattes, 195-222 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp;Ruprecht, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Bernhard Schlink was brought up in [[Heidelberg]] from the age of two. He studied law at [[West Berlin]]'s [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]], graduating in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.authortrek.com/bernhard_schlink_page.html |title=Bernhard Schlink page – biography bibliography interviews essays |publisher=Authortrek.com |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306190243/http://www.authortrek.com/bernhard_schlink_page.html |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlink became a judge at the Constitutional Court of the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1988 and in 1992 a professor for public law and the philosophy of law at [[Humboldt University]], Berlin. He retired in January 2006.

==Career==
Schlink studied law at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. He had been a law professor at the [[University of Bonn]] and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main]] before he started in 1992 at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. His career as a writer began with several [[detective novel]]s with a main character named Selb—a play on the German word for "self"—(the first, ''Self's Punishment'', co-written with {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Popp|de}} being available in the UK). One of these, ''Die gordische Schleife'', won the {{Interlanguage link multi|Glauser Prize|de|3=Friedrich-Glauser-Preis}} in 1989.

In 1995, he published ''[[The Reader]]'' (''Der Vorleser''), a novel about a teenager who has an affair with a woman in her thirties who suddenly vanishes but whom he meets again as a law student when visiting a trial about war crimes. The book became a bestseller both in Germany and the United States and was translated into 39 languages. It was the first German book to reach the number one position in the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list. In 1997, it won the [[Hans Fallada Prize]], a German literary award, and the Prix [[Laure Bataillon]] for works translated into French.  In 1999 it was awarded the [[Welt-Literaturpreis|''Welt''-Literaturpreis]] of the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]''.

In 2000, Schlink published a collection of short fiction called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Flights of Love|de|3=Liebesfluchten}}''.  A January 2008 literary tour, including an appearance in San Francisco for City Arts &amp; Lectures, was cancelled due to Schlink's recovery from minor surgery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 2008, [[Stephen Daldry]] directed a film adaptation of ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]].'' In 2010, his non-fiction political history, ''Guilt About the Past'' was published by Beautiful Books Limited (UK).

Schlink currently divides his time between New York and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-dark-inheritance/2008/02/01/1201801007073.html |title=A dark inheritance |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[PEN Centre Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pen-deutschland.de/en/pen-zentrum-deutschland/mitglieder/|title=Members|work=PEN-Zentrum Deutschland|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BrowserChoice.eu''' was a [[website]] created by [[Microsoft]] in March 2010 following a decision in the [[European Union Microsoft competition case]]. The case involved legal proceedings by the [[European Union]] against Microsoft and found that, by including [[Internet Explorer]] with their market-dominant [[Microsoft Windows|Windows operating system]], Microsoft had used this dominance to create a similar market position in the [[web browser]] market. The BrowserChoice.eu website was created to allow users that had not made, or were unaware of, a choice to try other browsers, and thus comply with the [[European Commission]]'s ruling.

However, Microsoft's obligation to display the Browser Choice screen to Windows users expired in December 2014.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/windows-browser-ballot-comes-to-an-end-as-ec-obligation-expires |title=Windows Browser Ballot comes to an end as EC obligation expires |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=18 December 2014 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BrowserChoice.eu website was discontinued as early as the next year, showing a notice advising users to "[visit] the websites of web browser vendors directly," before going offline completely.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208004146/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=8 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|November}}, the site is still offline.

==Web browser choice screen==
The ''web browser choice screen'', also known as the ''web browser ballot box'', was a screen displayed in [[Internet Explorer]] that offered ten to twelve browsers in a random order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2010/02/19/the-browser-choice-screen-for-europe-what-to-expect-when-to-expect-it.aspx |title=The Browser Choice Screen for Europe: What to Expect, When to Expect It |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |last=Heiner |first=Dave |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screen was presented only to Windows users whose default web browser is Internet Explorer. It affected the [[European Economic Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/dec09/12-16Statement.mspx |title=Microsoft Statement on European Commission Decision |publisher=Microsoft |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217083729/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/dec09/12-16Statement.mspx# |archive-date=17 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff606439.aspx |title=Browser Choice FAQ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patch was made available via [[Windows Update]] to provide the screen to users. It was displayed to anyone who had not chosen another browser as their default browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Microsoft-liefert-Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster-ab-17-Maerz-aus-935566.html |title=Microsoft liefert Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster ab 17. März aus |publisher=heise online |language=German |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Browsers listed==
The browser choice screen listed 10 to 12 browsers in random order; the top tier of five were immediately visible and the remaining ones could be seen by scrolling the list. The order of the browsers on the page was initially planned to be alphabetical, but after criticism a random system was used with two groups.

The first group included the five most used browsers ‒ [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and initially [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] but later [[Maxthon]] ‒ representing the four major rendering engines ([[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]], [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]], [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]] and [[WebKit]]). The second group contained less well-known browsers, also in random order: at different times this group included [[Avant Browser]], [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]], [[Maxthon]], [[Rockmelt]], [[SRWare Iron]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[SlimBrowser]].

===Revisions===
The initial March 2010 list had [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] in the first tier, with [[Avant Browser]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]] and [[SlimBrowser]] in the second tier.

In August 2010 Microsoft removed GreenBrowser and Sleipnir from the choices, replacing them with [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]] and [[SRWare Iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822062000/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=22 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828094328/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=28 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 Microsoft reduced the number of second tier browsers from the previous seven to six. They removed Flock and SlimBrowser, but re-established Sleipnir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103214224/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=3 November 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 Microsoft increased the number of second tier browsers to seven: [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]] and [[Rockmelt]] were added, while Sleipnir was removed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224114437/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=24 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 Microsoft removed Apple Safari from the first tier due to the browser's discontinuation on Windows, and replaced it with Maxthon. SlimBrowser was added back to the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919182030/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=19 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 Microsoft removed SlimBrowser from the second tier and replaced it with Sleipnir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226201610/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=26 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Microsoft removed Rockmelt from the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112827/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2014 Microsoft had removed Comodo Dragon from the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516183141/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 Comodo was returned to the second tier, replacing Avant Browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903235102/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 the website was discontinued and no longer lists any browsers.&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="website" /&gt;

==Results==
Competing browsers saw their traffic increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/technology/08browser.html |title=Microsoft Gives Rival Browsers a Lift |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that these smaller competing developers were gaining users. However, long-term trends show browsers such as Opera and Firefox losing market share in Europe, calling into question the usefulness of the browser choice screen.&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The source code of the page itself came under criticism. The order of the browsers on screen was at first insufficiently random, which led to uneven distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/22/microsoft-ballot-screen |title=How Random Is Microsoft's Random Browser Choice Screen In Europe? |publisher=TechCrunch |last=Wauters |first=Robin |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/03/coding-error-leads-to-uneven-eu-browser-ballot-distribution |title=Coding error leads to uneven EU browser ballot distribution |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later fixed by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/09/microsoft_browser_ballot_update |title=Microsoft rejiggers EU browser ballot after complaints |publisher=[[The Register]] |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of browsers was also criticised.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8545237.stm |title=Microsoft browser ballot criticised for being 'limited' |publisher=BBC |last=Ward |first=Mark |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its inception, half of the suggested browsers use Internet Explorer's [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] rendering engine, thus users who choose web browsers other than Internet Explorer for the intention of avoiding it might still end up using IE's layout engine.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited" /&gt; This has resulted in criticism amongst the web development community even though Microsoft was adhering to the court agreement's methodology.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited" /&gt;

Finally, the overall ability for users to access the site was criticised. [[Opera Software]] complained that the ballot screen could not be reached in some cases because of the start configuration screens of IE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/03/windows_ie_browser_ballot_screen |title=Opera alerts EU to hidden Windows browser-ballot |last=Clarke |first=Gavin |date=3 April 2010 |publisher=[[The Register]] |accessdate=8 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Microsoft had issues with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 no longer leading new users in the [[European Union]] to the page. The [[Windows7#Service Pack 1|Windows 7 SP1]] retail release was initially missing BrowserChoice.eu functionality, affecting 28 million computers. The error remained unpatched for 14 months, and as a result in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft €561 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21684329 |title=Microsoft fined by European Commission over web browser |publisher=BBC |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 8]] was also released without the browser choice screen functionality and patched several days after the release. [[Mozilla]]'s general counsel estimated that 6-9 million downloads of Firefox web browser alone were lost due to the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/firefox-lost-6-9-million-downloads-in-eu-browser-choice-glitch-7000006670/ |title=Firefox lost 6-9 million downloads in EU browser choice 'glitch' |last=Whittaker |first=Zach |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/10/3307564/windows-8-browser-choice-europe-windows-update |title=Windows 8 browser choice update now available in Europe |last=Warren |first=Tom |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petition==
Makers of the second-tier browsers [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[Avant Browser|Avant]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[SlimBrowser|Slim]] sent a petition to the EU to get [[Microsoft]] to add text or a graphic (rather than just the slider) indicating that there are more than five browsers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flock.com/petition_to_the_european_commission.pdf Petition To The European Commission]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030021348/http://flock.com/petition_to_the_european_commission.pdf |date=30 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft responded by stating: ''"We (Microsoft) do not plan on making any changes at this time."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000129-264.html |title=Minor browsers seek more prominence in Europe |publisher=CNET |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22357">The '''California Division of Juvenile Justice''' (DJJ), previously known as the '''California Youth Authority''' (CYA), is a division of the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] that provides [[education]], [[training]], and treatment services for [[California]]'s most serious [[youth]] offenders.  These youths are committed by the [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] and [[Crime|criminal]] [[court]]s to DJJ's eleven correctional facilities, four conservation camps and two residential [[drug addiction|drug treatment]] programs.  The DJJ provides services to juvenile offenders, ranging in age from twelve to 25, in facilities and on [[parole]], and works closely with law enforcement, the courts, [[district attorney]]s, [[public defender]]s, [[probation]] offices and other public and private agencies involved with the problems of youth.  The DJJ is undergoing reorganization as required by a court agreement and the [[California State Legislature]] after widespread criticisms of conditions at its youth prisons. The agency's headquarters are in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Divisions_Boards/DJJ/About_DJJ/index.html About the DJJ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107191121/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Divisions_Boards/DJJ/About_DJJ/index.html |date=2010-01-07 }}." California Division of Juvenile Justice. Retrieved on January 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Vision==

{{As of|2004}}, the CYA's stated mission:
*"The California Youth Authority will contribute to the protection of society from the consequences of criminal activity by providing youthful offender rehabilitation through education, training, treatment, and parole services that provide a continuum of care and assist with the reintegration of youthful offenders into society."

CYA vision:
*"The California Youth Authority will contribute to the [[public safety]] of the citizens of California by maintaining a safe and secure therapeutic environment, which will result in the optimum delivery of rehabilitative services for wards charged to its care."

==Education==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The CYA is legally required to provide a [[high school]] [[education]] for every ward who does not already have a [[diploma]].  However, students are sometimes kept from class because of safety and security situations, or teacher vacancies. Validated gang associates are sometimes kept from classroom or vocational training for institutional safety and security reasons relative to gang tensions or conflict.  Academic teachers and vocational instructors are credentialed through the [[California Commission on Teacher Credentialing]].  The Education area of the institution is referred to as the "Education Corridor" or "Trade Line", reflecting the Vocational Training focus of the institution. The Trade Line is monitored by security professionals known as "Youth Correctional Officers." (YCO). Students are escorted to the Trade Line from their living areas by "Youth Correctional Counselors" (YCC). The Educational System in the DJJ is part of the California Department of Education and each site is required to maintain accreditation through the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

==Conditions==

On non-school days, maximum security inmates are locked in their cells for 23 hours a day.  A spokesman for Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s prisons department said lengthy lockdowns at DJJ facilities were no longer used as punishment, but were sometimes necessary to maintain order.  One of the justifications for such treatment is gang affiliation and the threat of corresponding [[violence]].

Many of the Youthful Offenders at some DJJ facilities arrive on or are placed on [[psychotropic]] medications, a matter that has triggered protests and litigation.

The threat of violence is a constant distraction at DJJ facilities.  In 2004, a six-month investigation by the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' uncovered deep systemic flaws, concluding that violence was predominant, gangs ruled, and fear was pervasive.  The ''Mercury News'' reported that, at any given time, dozens of young men are held in isolation cells for fighting or other offenses at the state's two maximum security facilities, and that wards sometimes threw [[Feces|human waste]], [[blood]] or [[semen]] through the slots in their cell doors.

Experts who have studied the prisons have declared them the most violent in the nation, and there have been six [[suicide]]s in California's juvenile jails between 2000 and 2005.

In January 2005, Chief Deputy [[Inspector general|Inspector General]] [[Brett Morgan]] issued a report calling for the elimination of 23-hour-a-day [[incarceration]] policies for wards placed in administrative segregation and criticized the DJJ for failing to end the practice. The inspector general's report outlines Maldonado's history and offers a portrait of Chaderjian as a violent lockup where gang leaders seem to have more clout than the Youth Correctional Officers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Litigation==

Beginning in 2000, CYA was featured regularly in news headlines across the state.  Local and national [[mass media|media]] reported rampant violence, staff-on-ward beatings, canine attacks, multiple suicides, extended 23-hour lockdowns, and children attending classes while confined in cages.  That year, a [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] federal judge rejected a class action suit on behalf of all CYA inmates, declaring they had failed to back up claims forming the basis of their bid for sweeping revisions of CYA policies and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth Authority Suit Rebuffed |work=Sacramento Bee |first=Denny |last=Walsh |date=September 12, 2000 |url=http://www.centerforce.org/news/displayArticle.cfm?id=112 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906202357/http://www.centerforce.org/news/displayArticle.cfm?id=112 |archivedate=September 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge did allow three defined groups of wards to sue in three specific categories of contention on constitutional grounds.  Wards forcibly medicated with a psychotropic drug without a hearing were enabled to challenge CYA's forced drugging policy.  Wards committed for sexual offenses were allowed to challenge sex offender treatment programs in which they were placed.  Wards placed in isolation for their own safety without a hearing were also allowed to proceed with litigation.

In a separate lawsuit, the Prison Law Office complained that "Rehabilitation cannot succeed when the classroom is a cage and wards live in constant fear of physical and sexual violence from CYA staff and other wards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyers Go Behind Bars as Guardians of Prisoner Rights|first= Maura |last=Dolan|work=Los Angeles Times |page=A1|date=October 11, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/11/local/me-prison11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2002, a federal conditions lawsuit was filed against CYA by a coalition including the Prison Law Office.  The suit was refiled In January 2003, as Farrell v. Harper (later renamed [[Farrell v. Hickman]].  The parties agreed to jointly select national experts to determine the nature and extent of the CYA's problems.  By 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger had settled that lawsuit and pledged to make significant changes, but his administration has missed several court-imposed deadlines to implement reforms, including policies regarding [[suicide prevention]], according to Specter.  A [[special master]] was appointed to oversee reform implementation.

In 2001, another lawsuit against CYA prompted a [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] judge to direct the CYA to obtain licenses for all eleven of its health care facilities within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 5, 2001|title=Court Rules California Youth Authority Facilities Must Have Licensed Hospitals|url=http://www.californiahealthline.org/Articles/2001/11/5/Court-Rules-California-Youth-Authority-Facilities-Must-Have-Licensed-Hospitals.aspx|publisher=California Healthline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DJJ previously housed over 6,000 youths; now with court-ordered reforms, numbers are down by two-thirds. Plaintiff's attorneys who document these changes also note many changes in the conditions of confinement, health services, etc.

Its predecessor, CYA, had a $387 million annual budget as of 2004.  Each year, well over 2,000 young offenders are admitted to DJJ, while a similar number are released.  Most [[Ward (legal)|wards]] are committed for [[violent crime]]s, and are institutionalized for over two years on average, at a cost to the state of over $71,000 per inmate each year, an increase of over 130%, from $30,783 in 1990.  In recent years, California's [[Juvenile court|juvenile justice]] system has received intense and increasing criticism from experts nationwide for running [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] youth [[prison]]s.

==Stockton:  N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility==

The [[N.A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility]] in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] is one of the CYA's two maximum security lockups and holds those aged 18–24, and was described as the home for the worst-of-the-worst juvenile offenders.  Chaderjian, also known as "Chad", earned national headlines in 2004 "when guards were captured on film kicking and punching wards."&lt;ref name=Martin05&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first= Mark|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/12/30/MNGVDGF8C71.DTL |title=Prison blamed in teen death.

In August 2005, 18-year-old Joseph Daniel Maldonado hanged himself at Chaderjian, sparking yet another round of outcries about conditions and calls for closure.&lt;ref name=Martin05/&gt; In the eight weeks before he died, Maldonado had rarely been let out of his cell and was denied family visits, mental health care, and educational services.

The extended [[lockdown]] at the facility was contrary to the rehabilitative mission of the state's youth corrections system, according to state officials.  Deputy Inspector Morgan said the eight-week lockdown was known about by at least two top-level juvenile corrections officials in Sacramento.

During lockdowns, wards are allowed showers three times a week, but are allowed no time to attend school, exercise or interact with [[mental health]] professionals.

The Prison Law Office website notes recent mission changes include reducing the number of the offenders and decreasing lockdowns.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} "It appears that the steps that CDCR and DJJ have taken since June 2007 have improved DJJ’s management effectiveness and the capacity of CDCR/DJJ business systems; however, issues of effectiveness and capacity continue to interfere with DJJ’s progress towards compliance with the remedial plans."  

The same report notes that in 2007 Chad hired a Chief Psychologist, Dr. Eric Kunkel, who in turn brought on many more psychologists, licensed psychiatric technicians and psychiatrists to attend to youth needs.&lt;ref name="Brorby"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brorby|first=Donna|url=http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/7thSMReport.pdf|title=Seventh report of Special Master|publisher=Superior Court of California, City and County of Alameda|date=April 17, 2008|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706121130/http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/7thSMReport.pdf|archivedate=July 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, girls were transferred to the newly established Ventura School for Girls from the formerly coed [[Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility|Whittier State Reformatory]]. The Ventura School for Girls moved from its Ventura location to Camarillo in 1962 and became co-educational in 1970. The Ventura Youth Correctional Facility returned to being a females-only facility in 2004. The S. Carraway Public Service and Fire Protection Center was closed in 2011 and fire crews were consolidated in the Pine Grove facility. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Juvenile_Justice/DJJ_History/ "History of the Division of Juvenile Justice"] ''California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation'' Retrieved 16 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foster grandparent programs==

Because few parents participate, foster grandparents at DJJ facilities fill the role of [[surrogate parent]]s.  All foster grandparents receive training from Special Education Resource Specialists and multi-language training.

==Reform==
Juvenile Justice Division reports, spurred by litigation against the CYA, were released in January 2004.  Their reports confirmed serious abuses and major deficiencies in virtually every aspect of the CYA's operation, and criticized the agency for failing in its rehabilitative and public safety mission.  The experts found the CYA to be incompetent in every area reviewed:  the safety of the facilities, the quality of education and health care, and the efficacy of the [[mental health]], [[substance abuse]] and other treatment programs.  The system, according to the experts, was not simply failing to rehabilitate, it was demonstrably inflicting damage on incarcerated youths, who were often discharged with increased criminal sophistication, entrenched gang involvement and exacerbated mental illness.

On September 1, 2005, DJJ submitted a report on youth corrections reform to the California Legislature.  The report required DJJ to file quarterly reports on steps taken, using $1.2 million in fiscal year 2005-06 planning funds, toward implementing an overall reform plan, including any proposed changes in population, jurisdiction or length of stay or changes in state-local juvenile justice responsibilities and "specific objectives, tasks and timelines."  However, DJJ presented no objectives, tasks or timelines for reform.  Nor did it offer new plans to adjust the institutionalized population.  Rather, DJJ said that "at this time" the department does not propose to change any state laws with respect to "jurisdictional eligibility criteria, including age, gender, offense criteria, medical or mental health needs or length of confinement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinhart|first=David|url=http://www.commonweal.org/programs/jjp-reports/VPI_bulletin_1105.html|title=Juvenile Justice Division submits tepid reform status report to Legislature|publisher=Commonweal, The Juvenile Justice Program|date=November 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005003626/http://www.commonweal.org/programs/jjp-reports/VPI_bulletin_1105.html|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and calls for closure==
There have been many calls to shut down DJJ/CYA altogether.  A spate of such calls came in the wake of [[scandal]]s arising after a video tape surfaced, in 2004, of a youth being punched in the head repeatedly by a guard at the Stockton facility and two youths dying there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Six Fired Youth Prison Counselors Are Reinstated| date=August 31, 2005|first=Jenifer |last=Warren|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/31/local/me-cya31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point to reports that over 90% of those released from DJJ (then CYA) ended up in adult prison, and that within three years five percent are dead and only four percent are in school or working. DJJ does have a ward data system, the Offender Based Information Tracking System (OBITS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research and Statistics|publisher=Division of Juvenile Justice |url= http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/research_tips.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921165309/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/research_tips.html|archivedate=2008-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which compiles some demographic data, drug test results and length of incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Juvenile Justice System|title=California’s Criminal Justice System: A Primer|date=January 31, 2007|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/2007/cj_primer/cj_primer_013107.aspx#chapter5|publisher=California Legislative Analyst's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DJJ officers and guards are not armed — no firearms are allowed within juvenile institutions. Firearms are only on the person of an officer if he/she is outside of the institution, transporting a Youthful offender to Court or a medical facility. Youthful Offenders are no longer kept in "cages" following Farrell reforms.

Teens with [[mental health]] problems were made worse, not better, by a system that is failing to rehabilitate kids, according to reports by independent experts.&lt;ref name="Brorby"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin04&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first= Mark|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/02/03/MNGH84NN691.DTL |title=Youth Authority: 'factory for prisons.' Probes for state report violence, kids kept in cages|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date= February 3, 2004|page=A-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among larger states, California consistently has had the highest youth incarceration rate, with more than double the national average youth incarceration rate, which critics decry for contributing to chronic overcrowding, unsafe conditions, poor health services, and numerous related problems, including gang violence.

A July 2008 report by California's Little Hoover Commission recommended that the state "eliminate its juvenile justice operations by 2011" by "turning supervision of all youth offenders over to counties and providing the resources for counties and county consortiums to supervise the most serious youth offenders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Little Hoover Commission|url=http://www.lhc.ca.gov/studies/192/report192.html|title=Report #192: Juvenile Justice Reform: Realigning Responsibilities|date= July 2008|accessdate= 16 Jul 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46695">'''Capital controls''' are residency-based measures such as [[Financial transaction tax|transaction taxes]], other limits, or outright prohibitions that a nation's government can use to regulate flows from [[capital market]]s into and out of the country's [[capital account]]. These measures may be economy-wide, sector-specific (usually the financial sector), or industry specific (for example, “strategic” industries). They may apply to all flows, or may differentiate by type or duration of the flow (debt, equity, direct investment; short-term vs. medium- and long-term).

Types of capital control include [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]] that prevent or limit the buying and selling of a national currency at the market rate,  caps on the allowed volume for the international sale or purchase of various financial assets, transaction taxes such as the proposed [[Tobin tax]] on currency exchanges, minimum stay requirements, requirements for mandatory approval, or even limits on the amount of money a private citizen is allowed to remove from the country. There have been several shifts of opinion on whether capital controls are beneficial and in what circumstances they should be used.

Capital controls were an integral part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] which emerged after World War II and lasted until the early 1970s. This period was the first time capital controls had been endorsed by [[mainstream economics]]. In the 1970s [[Free-market economics|free market economists]] became increasingly successful in persuading their colleagues that capital controls were in the main harmful. The USA, other western governments, and multilateral financial institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] began to take a critical view of capital controls and persuaded many countries to abandon them to facilitate [[Economic globalization|financial globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Stanley|title=Capital Account Liberalization and the Role of the IMF|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/1997/091997.htm|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin American debt crisis]] of the early 1980s, the [[Asian financial crisis|East Asian financial crisis]] of the late 1990s, the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian ruble crisis]] of 1998–99, and the [[global financial crisis]] of 2008, however, highlighted the risks associated with the volatility of [[capital (economics)|capital flows]], and led many countries — even those with relatively open [[Capital account|capital accounts]] — to make use of capital controls alongside macroeconomic and prudential policies as means to dampen the effects of volatile flows on their economies.

In the aftermath of the [[global financial crisis]], as capital inflows surged to [[emerging market]] economies, a group of economists at the IMF outlined the elements of a policy toolkit to manage the macroeconomic and financial – stability risks associated with capital flow volatility. The proposed toolkit allowed a role for capital controls.&lt;ref name=Ostry2010&gt;[[Jonathan D. Ostry]], Atish R. Ghosh, Karl Habermeier, Marcos Chamon, Mahvash S. Qureshi, and Dennis B.S. Reinhardt (2010-02-19). "[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1004.pdf Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls]." Staff Position Note 10/04.

More widespread use of capital controls, however, raises a host of multilateral coordination issues, as enunciated for example by the G-20, echoing the concerns voiced by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Harry Dexter White]] more than six decades ago.&lt;ref name=Ostry2012 &gt;[[Jonathan D. Ostry]], Atish R. Ghosh, and Anton Korinek (2012b) “[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2012/sdn1210.pdf Multilateral Aspects of Managing the Capital Account],” SDN/12/10. [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Pre World War I===
Prior to the 19th century there was generally little need for capital controls due to low levels of international trade and  financial integration. In the [[International monetary systems#The pre WWI financial order: 1870–1914|first age of globalisation]] which is generally dated from 1870–1914, capital controls remained largely absent.&lt;ref name = "GPE"&gt;{{cite book

===World War I to World War II: 1914–1945===
Highly restrictive capital controls were introduced with the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In the 1920s they were generally relaxed, only to be strengthened again in the wake of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]]. This was more an ''ad hoc'' response to potentially damaging flows rather than based on a change in normative economic theory. Economic historian [[Barry Eichengreen]] has implied that the use of capital controls peaked during World War II, but the more general view is that the most wide ranging implementation occurred after Bretton Woods.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Eichengreen"&gt;{{cite book

The tax was needed to limit the removal of capital from the country by wealthy residents. At the time [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] was suffering economic hardship due to the [[Great Depression]] and the harsh [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] imposed after World War I.

===The Bretton Woods Era: 1945–1971===
[[File:Image-Mount Washington Hotel.jpg|thumb| A widespread system of capital controls were decided upon at the international 1944 conference at [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] ]]
At the end of World War II, international capital was "caged" by the imposition of strong and wide ranging capital controls as part of the newly created [[Bretton Woods system]]—it was perceived that this would help protect the interests of ordinary people and the wider economy. These measures were popular as at this time the western public's view of international bankers was generally very low, blaming them for the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name = "IFM"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keynes]], one of the principal architects of the Bretton Woods system, envisaged capital controls as a permanent feature of the [[international monetary system]],&lt;ref name = "Greek"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; though he had agreed [[current account]] convertibility should be adopted once international conditions had stabilised sufficiently. This essentially meant that currencies were to be freely convertible for the purposes of international trade in goods and services, but not for [[capital account]] transactions. Most industrial economies relaxed their controls around 1958 to allow this to happen.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The other leading architect of Bretton Woods, the American [[Harry Dexter White]], and his boss [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], were somewhat less radical than Keynes, but still agreed on the need for permanent capital controls. In his closing address to the Bretton Woods conference, Morgenthau spoke of how the measures adopted would drive "the usurious money lenders from the temple of international finance."&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt;

Following the [[Keynesian Revolution]], the first two decades after World War II saw little argument against capital controls from economists, though an exception was [[Milton Friedman]]. However, from the late 1950s the effectiveness of capital controls began to break down, in part due to innovations such as the [[Eurodollar]] market. According to [[Dani Rodrik]] it is unclear to what extent this was due to an unwillingness on the part of governments to respond effectively, as compared with an inability to do so.&lt;ref name = "Greek"/&gt; Eric Helleiner has argued that heavy lobbying from Wall Street bankers was a factor in persuading American authorities not to subject the Eurodollar market to capital controls. From the late 1960s the prevailing opinion among economists began to switch to the view that capital controls are on the whole more harmful than beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;

While many of the capital controls in this era were directed at international financiers and banks, some were directed at individual citizens. For example, in the 1960s, [[United Kingdom|British]] individuals were at one point [[Exchange Controls in the United Kingdom|restricted from taking more than £50]] with them out of the country for their foreign holidays.&lt;ref name = "wolf"&gt;{{cite book

===post Bretton Woods era: 1971–2009===
By the late 1970s, as part of the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in favour of free market orientated policies and theories, countries began abolishing their capital controls, starting between 1973–4 with the U.S., Canada, Germany and Switzerland and followed by the United Kingdom in 1979.&lt;ref name = "inside"&gt;{{cite book

The orthodox view that capital controls are a bad thing was challenged following the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].

===After 2008 global crisis: 2009 and later===
By 2009, the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]] had caused a [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|resurgence in Keynesian thought]] which reversed the previously prevailing orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis]], the IMF proposed that capital controls on outflows should be imposed by Iceland, calling them "an essential feature of the monetary policy framework, given the scale of potential capital outflows."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2009/pr09375.htm IMF Completes First Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Iceland, Extends Arrangement, and Approves US$167.5 Million Disbursement], Press Release No. 09/375, October 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of 2009, as the global economy started to recover from the Global Financial Crisis, capital inflows to emerging market economies—especially, in Asia and Latin America—surged, raising macroeconomic and financial-stability risks. Several emerging market economies responded to these concerns by adopting capital controls or macroprudential measures; for example, [[Brazil]] imposed a tax on the purchase of financial assets by foreigners and [[Taiwan]] restricted overseas investors from buying [[Time deposit]]s.&lt;ref name = "hotMoney"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The partial return to favor of capital controls is linked to a wider emerging consensus among policy makers for the greater use of [[macroprudential policy]].

In June 2010 ''[[The Financial Times]]'' published several articles on the growing trend towards using capital controls. They noted influential voices from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and [[World Bank]] had joined the IMF in advising there is a role for capital controls. The FT reported on the recent tightening of controls in Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Russia. In Indonesia recently implemented controls include a one-month minimum holding period for certain securities. In South Korea limits have been placed on currency forward positions. In Taiwan the access that foreigner investors have to certain bank deposits has been restricted. The FT cautioned that imposing controls has a downside including the creation of possible future problems in attracting funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Not all momentum has been in favor of increased use of capital controls however. For example, in December 2011 China partially loosened its controls on inbound capital flows, which the ''Financial Times'' described as reflecting an ongoing desire by Chinese authorities for further liberalization.

In September 2012,  Michael W. Klein  of [[Tufts University]] challenged the emergent consensus that short-term capital controls can be beneficial, publishing a preliminary study that found the measures used by countries like Brazil had been ineffective (at least up to 2010). Klein argues it was only countries with long term capital controls, such as China and India, that have enjoyed measurable protection from adverse capital flows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall%202012/2012%20fall%20klein.pdf Capital Controls: Gates and Walls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114203919/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall%202012/2012%20fall%20klein.pdf |date=January 14, 2013 }} by Michael W. Klein ([[Tufts]]), September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[Ila Patnaik]] and [[Ajay Shah]] of [[NIPFP]] published an article about the permanent and comprehensive capital controls in India, which seem to have been ineffective in achieving the goals of macroeconomic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macrofinance.nipfp.org.in/releases/PS2012_CapitalControls.html Did the Indian capital controls work as a tool of macroeconomic policy?, IMF Economic Review, September 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have found that capital controls may lower financial stability risks,&lt;ref name=Ostry2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostryjie2012 /&gt; while the controls Brazilian authorities adopted after the 2008 financial crisis did have some beneficial effect on Brazil itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://policydialogue.org/publications/working_papers/navigating_capital_flows_in_brazil_and_chile/#/ Navigating Capital Flows in Brazil and Chile] by Brittany Baumann and Kevin Gallagher ([[Boston University|BU]]), June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet capital controls may have externalities: some empirical studies find that capital flows were diverted to other countries as capital controls were tightened in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1980091 Capital Controls and Spillover Effects: Evidence from Latin-American Countries] by Frederic J. Lambert, Julio Ramos-Tallada and Cyril Rebillard (Banque de France), December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2056491 Bubble Thy Neighbor: Portfolio Effects and Externalities from Capital Controls] by Kristin J. Forbes ([[MIT]]), April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An IMF staff discussion (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2012) note explores the multilateral consequences of capital controls, and the desirability of international cooperation to achieve globally efficient outcomes.&lt;ref name=Ostry2012 /&gt; It flags three issues of potential concern. First is the possibility that capital controls may be used as a substitute for warranted external adjustment (for example, when inflow controls are used to sustain an undervalued currency). Second, the imposition of capital controls by one country may deflect some capital towards other recipient countries, exacerbating their inflow problem. Third, policies in source countries (including monetary policy) may exacerbate problems faced by capital-receiving countries if they increase the volume or riskiness of capital flows. The paper argues however that if capital controls are justified from a national standpoint (in terms of reducing domestic distortions), then under a range of circumstances they should be pursued even if they give rise to cross-border spillovers. But if policies in one country exacerbate existing distortions in other countries, and it is costly for other countries to respond, then multilateral coordination of unilateral policies is likely to be beneficial. Coordination may require borrowers to reduce inflow controls or an agreement with lenders to partially internalize the risks from excessively large or risky outflows.

On December 3, the IMF published a staff paper which further expanded on their recent support for the limited use of capital controls.&lt;ref name=imfinstview /&gt;

===The impossible trinity trilemma===
The history of capital controls is sometimes discussed in relation to the [[impossible trinity]] (trilemma, the unholy trinity)– the finding that its impossible for a nation's economic policy to simultaneously deliver more than two of the following three desirable macroeconomic goals: 1) A [[fixed exchange rate]], 2) an independent [[monetary policy]], 3) free movement for capital (absence of capital controls).
&lt;ref name = "European"/&gt;
In the ''first age of globalization'', governments largely chose to pursue a stable exchange rate while allowing freedom of movement for capital. The sacrifice was that their monetary policy was largely dictated by international conditions, not by the needs of the domestic economy. In the ''Bretton woods'' period, governments were free to have both generally stable exchange rates and independent monetary policies at the price of capital controls. The ''impossible trinity'' concept was especially influential during this era as a justification for capital controls. In the ''Washington consensus'' period, advanced economies generally chose to allow freedom of capital and to continue maintaining an independent monetary policy while accepting a [[Floating exchange rate|floating]] or semi-floating exchange rate.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "regaining"/&gt;

== Capital controls in the EU and EFTA ==
There have been three instances of capital controls in the EU and EFTA since 2008{{spaced ndash}}all of them triggered by banking crises.

=== Iceland (2008–2017) ===
In its [[2008-2011 Icelandic financial crisis|2008 financial crisis]], [[Iceland]] (which is a member of the [[European Free Trade Area]] but not the [[European Union]]) imposed capital controls due to the collapse of its banking system. Iceland's government said in June 2015 that it planned to lift them – however, since the announced plans included a tax on taking capital out of the country, arguably they still constituted capital controls. The Icelandic government announced that capital controls had been lifted on 12 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/news-and-articles/iceland-lifts-capital-controls|title=Iceland Lifts Capital Controls|website=Prime Minister´s Office|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Cyprus (2013–2015) ===
[[Cyprus]], a [[Eurozone]] member state which is closely linked to [[Greece]], imposed the Eurozone's first temporary capital controls in 2013 as part of its response to [[2012-13 Cypriot financial crisis|its 2012 banking crisis]]. These capital controls were lifted in 2015, with the last controls being removed in April 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc-cyprus"&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32194092recover|title=Cyprus lifts all capital controls as banks recover|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece (2015–) ===
See [[Capital controls in Greece]]

==Adoption of Prudential Measures==
The [[prudential capital controls]] measure distinguishes itself from the general capital controls as summarized above as it is one of the prudential regulations that aims to mitigate the systemic risk, reduce the business cycle volatility, increase the macroeconomic stability, and enhance the social welfare. It generally regulates inflows only and take ex-ante policy interventions. The "prudence" requirement says that such regulation should curb and manage the excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethought to prevent an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. The "ex-ante" timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy.

==Free movement of capital and payments==
[[File:International Finance Centre (Tower 1).jpg|thumb|The [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|International Finance Centre]] in [[Hong Kong]] would likely oppose capital controls, and attempt to argue that they would not work.]]
Full freedom of movement for capital and payments has so far only been approached between individual pairings of states which have free trade agreements and relative freedom from capital controls, such as Canada and the U.S.,  or the complete freedom within  regions such as the  [[European Union]], with its [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|"Four Freedoms"]] and the [[Eurozone]]. During the ''first age of globalization'' that was brought to an end by World War I, there were very few restrictions on the movement of capital, but all major economies except for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands heavily restricted payments for goods by the use of current account controls such as [[tariff]]s and [[Duty (economics)|duties]].&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

===Arguments in favour of free capital movement===
Pro free market economists claim the following advantages for free movement of capital:
* It enhances overall economic growth by allowing savings to be channelled to their most productive use.&lt;ref name = "globe"/&gt;
* By encouraging foreign direct investment it helps developing economies to benefit from foreign expertise.&lt;ref name = "globe"/&gt;
* Allows states to raise funds from external markets to help them mitigate a temporary recession.&lt;ref name = "globe"/&gt;
* Enables both savers and borrowers to secure the best available market rate.&lt;ref name = "European"/&gt;
* When controls include taxes, funds raised are sometimes siphoned off by corrupt government officials for their personal use.&lt;ref name = "European"/&gt;
* [[Hawala]]-type traders across Asia have always been able to evade currency movement controls
* [[Computers|Computer]] and communications technologies have made unimpeded [[electronic funds transfer]] a convenience for increasing numbers of bank customers.

===Arguments in favour of capital controls===
Pro capital control economists have made the following points.
* Capital controls may represent an optimal [[macroprudential policy]] that reduces the risk of financial crises and prevents the associated externalities.&lt;ref name=Ostry2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostryjie2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Koriprud"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* Global economic growth was on average considerably higher in the Bretton Woods periods where capital controls were widely in use. Using [[regression analysis]], economists such as [[Dani Rodrik]] have found no positive correlation between growth and free capital movement.&lt;ref name = "globe"/&gt;
* Capital controls limiting a nation's residents from owning foreign assets can ensure that domestic credit is available more cheaply than would otherwise be the case. This sort of capital control is still in effect in both India and China. In India the controls encourage residents to provide cheap funds directly to the government, while in China it means that Chinese businesses have an inexpensive source of loans.&lt;ref name = "differentBook"/&gt;
* Economic crises have been considerably more frequent since the Bretton Woods capital controls were relaxed. Even economic historians who class capital controls as repressive have concluded that capital controls, more than the period's high growth, were responsible for the infrequency of crisis.&lt;ref name = "differentBook"/&gt; Large uncontrolled capital inflows have frequently damaged a nation's economic development by causing its currency to appreciate, by contributing to inflation, and by causing unsustainable  economic booms which often precede financial crises – caused when the inflows sharply reverse and both domestic and foreign capital flee the country. The risk of crisis is especially high in developing economies where the inbound flows become loans denominated in foreign currency, so that the repayments become considerably more expensive as the developing country's currency depreciates. This is known as [[original sin (economics)|original sin]].&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Subra"&gt;{{cite web

A '''contract''' is a promise or set of promises that are legally enforceable and, if violated, allow the injured party access to legal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/contract-law/|title=Case Note - Contract Law - Rule of Law Institute of Australia|date=2018-05-31|work=Rule of Law Institute of Australia|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract law recognises and governs the rights and duties arising from agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Round Hall nutshells Contract Law|last=Ryan|first=Fergus|publisher=Thomson Round Hall|year=2006|isbn=9781858001715|location=|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Anglo-American common law]], formation of a contract generally requires an [[Offer and acceptance|offer, acceptance]], [[consideration]], and a [[Meeting of the minds|mutual intent to be bound]].

Although most oral contracts are binding, some types of contracts may require [[Statute of frauds|formalities]] such as being in the form of a signed, dated written agreement in order for a party to be bound to its terms. 

In the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, contract law is a branch of the [[law of obligations]].

==Formation==
At common law, the elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, intention to create legal relations, and consideration.

Not all agreements are necessarily contractual, as the parties generally must be deemed to have an [[intention to be legally bound]]. A so-called [[gentlemen's agreement]] is one which is not intended to be legally enforceable, and "binding in honour only".&lt;ref&gt;''Rose &amp; Frank Co. v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd.'' [1923] 2 K.B. 261, 273 (Bailhache J).

===Offer and acceptance===

{{Main|Offer and acceptance|Meeting of the minds}}

In order for a contract to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a [[meeting of the minds]]). This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the "[[mirror image rule]]". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=Máiréad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]],&lt;ref&gt;DiMatteo L. (1997). [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/dimatteo5.html The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment]. ''South Carolina Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; as determined in the early English case of ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1973|litigants=George Hudson Holdings Ltd v Rudder (1973) 128 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Unilateral contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] --&gt;
Contracts may be [[wikt:Bilateral|bilateral]] or [[unilateral]]. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a [[promise]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise promise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of [[commerce]] transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive [[condition precedent|precedent]] requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled.

Less common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an "invitation to treat" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=943315&amp;download=yes Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters]. ''Hastings Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is "unscientific and misleading".&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot et al, 2009, ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain circumstances, an [[implied contract]] may be created. A contract is [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has [[Breach of contract|breached a contract]] implied in fact. A contract which is [[implied in law contract|implied in law]] is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the [[court]]s to remedy situations in which one party would be [[Unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] were he or she not required to compensate the other. [[Quantum meruit]] claims are an example.

====Invitation to treat====
{{Main|Invitation to treat}}
Where something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, this will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an [[invitation to treat]], an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/casessubmitForm.do ''Harris v Nickerson'' (1873) LR8QB 286]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Household Fire Insurance v Grant'' 1879&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer]]
An exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]] |parallelcite=[1893] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 256 |year=1892 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; decided in [[Victorian era|nineteenth-century England]]. ''Carbolic'', a medical firm, advertised a [[smoke ball]] marketed as a [[Panacea (medicine)|wonder drug]] that would, according to the instructions, protect users from catching the [[Influenza|flu]]. If it did not work, buyers would receive [[pound sterling|£]]100 and the company said that they had deposited £1,000 in the bank to show their good faith. When sued, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, [[legally binding]] [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]; instead it was "a mere puff", or  [[gimmick]]. But the [[court of appeal]] held that it would appear to a [[reasonable man]] that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.

Although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer.  For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to &lt;span lang="simple"&gt;treat&lt;/span&gt;, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms).  If, as in the ''Boots case'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/AU/files/720502512/pharmaceutical_society_of_great_britian_v_boots_cash_chemists.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd''], 1953, 1 Q.B. 401&lt;/ref&gt; the offer is made by an action without any negotiations (such as presenting goods to a cashier), the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat.

Auctions are governed by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (as amended), where section 57(2) provides: “A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner.  Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid”.

====Electronic contracts====
Entry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract.

In India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linstone|first1=Harold A.|title=Understanding Electronic Contracts - The Indian Law of Contract|url=http://www.nalsarpro.org/CL/Modules/Module%201/Chapter3.pdf|website=Nalsar Pro|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as “its contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute” and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Stonehill Capital Management LLC v. Bank of the West'', 28 NY 3d 439 (2016)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9580463301815278461|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intention to be legally bound===
{{Main|Intention to be legally bound}}
In commercial agreements it is presumed that parties intend to be legally bound unless the parties expressly state the opposite as in a [[Heads of agreement (law)|heads of agreement]] document. For example, in ''[[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd]]'' an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an 'honour clause' in the document stated "this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties".

In contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of [[public policy]]. For example, in the English case ''[[Balfour v. Balfour]]'' a husband agreed to give his wife £30 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences.

===Consideration===
{{Main|Consideration}}
A concept of English common law, [[consideration]]  is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]).  The court in ''Currie v Misa'' &lt;ref&gt;''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893&lt;/ref&gt; declared consideration to be a “Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.&lt;ref&gt;''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&amp;context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William &amp; Mary Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dunlop v. Selfridge'' Lord Dunedin adopted Pollack's metaphor of purchase and sale{{clarify|date=April 2018}} to explain consideration. He called consideration 'the price for which the promise of the other is bought'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=Máiréad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Dublin 8|pages=75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonial times, the concept of consideration was exported to many common law countries,{{which|date=April 2018}} but it is unknown in Scotland and in civil law jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Scots lawyer [[Harvey McGregor]]'s "[[Contract Code]]", a [[Law Commission]]-sponsored proposal to both unite and codify English and Scots Law, proposed the abolition of consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman law-based systems&lt;ref&gt;e.g. In Germany, § 311 BGB&lt;/ref&gt; neither require nor recognise consideration, and some commentators have suggested that consideration be abandoned, and estoppel be used to replace it as a basis for contracts.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that "The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind."&lt;ref name="High Trees"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]] |year=2007 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1329 |parallelcite=[1947] [[Kings Bench|KB]] 130 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by ''[[Hamer v. Sidway]]'' (1891).

Courts will typically not weigh the "adequacy" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be "sufficient", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas "adequacy" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd]]'' [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording.&lt;/ref&gt; (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#2|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the ''peppercorn rule'', but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient ''nominal consideration''. An exception to the rule of adequacy is money, whereby a debt must always be paid in full  for "[[accord and satisfaction]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Pinnel’s Case" (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jorden v Money"	(1854) 5 HLC 185&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Foakes v Beer]] |court=UKHL |year=1884 |num=1 |parallelcite=(1884) [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 605 |courtname=auto}}. ([[per incuriam]]?&lt;ref name="High Trees"/&gt;)}}&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.4226419405620667&amp;service=citation&amp;langcountry=AU&amp;backKey=20_T24416359152&amp;linkInfo=F%23AU%23All+ER%23vol%251%25sel1%251990%25page%25512%25year%251990%25sel2%251%25&amp;ersKey=23_T24416359123 Williams v Roffey Bros and Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd {1990} 1 All ER 512."]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, consideration must be given as part of entering the contract, not prior  as in past consideration. For example, in the early English case of ''Eastwood v. Kenyon'' [1840], the guardian  of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the ''preexisting duty rule.'' In the early English case of ''[[Stilk v. Myrick]]'' [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The preexisting duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v. Godefroy'' (1831) 1 B. &amp; Ad. 950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity==
{{Main|Capacity (law)}}
Sometimes the capacity of either [[natural person|natural]] or [[artificial person|artificial]] persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;see for a discussion of the position in English law, the [[Capacity in English law#lackofcapacity intoxication2016-07-24|article on Capacity in English law]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each contractual party must be a "competent person" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons  ("individuals") or [[Legal personality|juristic person]]s ("[[corporation]]s"). An agreement is formed when an "offer" is accepted. The parties must have an [[intention to be legally bound]]; and to be valid, the agreement must have both proper [[Formalities in English law|"form"]] and a lawful object.  In [[England]] (and in [[jurisdiction]]s using English contract principles), the parties must also exchange "[[Consideration in English law|consideration]]" to create a "mutuality of obligation," as in [[Semble#law|Simpkins v Pays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contracts.uslegal.com/elements-of-a-contract/ Elements of a Contract - Contracts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, persons under 18 are typically [[Minor (law)|minor]] and their contracts are considered [[voidable]]; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits received by the minor must be returned. The minor can enforce breaches of contract by an adult while the adult's enforcement may be more limited under the bargain principle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Promissory estoppel]] or [[unjust enrichment]] may be available, but generally are not.

==Formalities and writing requirements for some contracts==
{{Main|Statute of frauds}}

A contract is often evidenced in writing or by [[deed]], the general rule is that a person who signs a contractual document will be bound by the terms in that document, this rule is referred to as the rule in ''[[L'Estrange v Graucob]]''.&lt;ref name="L'Estrange v Graucob"&gt;''[[L'Estrange v Graucob]]'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 394.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is approved by the High Court of Australia in ''Toll(FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd''.&lt;ref name="Toll v Alphapharm"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|52|2004|litigants=[[Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(2004) 219 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 165 |courtname=auto |date=11 November 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But a valid contract may (with some exceptions) be made orally or even by conduct.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, bidding in auctions, or acting in response to a unilateral offer&lt;/ref&gt; Remedies for [[breach of contract]]  include damages (monetary compensation for loss)&lt;ref name="Hadley v Baxendale"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hadley v Baxendale]] |court=EWHC |year=1854 |num=J70 |parallelcite=[[England Law Reports|ER]] 145 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for serious breaches only, repudiation (i.e. cancellation).&lt;ref&gt;as in [[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] and [[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH|The Mihalis Angelos]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The equitable remedy of [[specific performance]], enforceable through an [[injunction]], may be available if damages are insufficient.

Typically, contracts are oral or written, but written contracts have typically been preferred in [[common law]] legal systems;&lt;ref&gt;Michida S. (1992) [http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/997/1PacRimLPolyJ199.pdf?sequence=1 Contract Societies: Japan and the United States Contrasted]. ''Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1677 England passed the [[Statute of Frauds]] which influenced similar [[statute of frauds]] laws&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.business.gov.au/people/contractors/understanding-contracts/laws-affecting-contracts|title=Laws affecting contracts|last=business.gov.au|first=|date=2018-07-18|website=www.business.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States and other countries such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;In Australia, the Sales of Goods Act applies.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as adopted in the United States requires a written contract for tangible product sales in excess of $500, and real estate contracts are required to be written. If the contract is not required by law to be written, an oral contract is valid and therefore legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;Trans-Lex.org: [http://www.trans-lex.org/923000 international principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom has since replaced the original Statute of Frauds, but written contracts are still required for various circumstances such as land (through the [[Law of Property Act 1925]]).

An [[oral contract]] may also be called a parol contract or a verbal contract, with "verbal" meaning "spoken" rather than "in words", an established usage in [[British English]] with regards to contracts and agreements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchfield|first=R.W.|title=The New Fowler's Modern English Usage.|date=1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198602634|pages=820–821|edition=Revised 3rd|quote=Expressed or conveyed by speech instead of writing; oral... e.g. verbal agreement, contract, evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt; and common although somewhat deprecated as "loose" in [[American English]].&lt;ref name="Garner1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan A. Garner|title=Black's Law Dictionary: Definitions of the Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y40jmgEACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=West Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-314-15234-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a contract is in a written form, and somebody signs it, then the signer is typically bound by its terms regardless of whether they have actually read it &lt;ref name="L'Estrange v Graucob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toll v Alphapharm"/&gt; provided the document is contractual in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]'' [1951] 1 KB 805&lt;/ref&gt; However, affirmative defenses such as duress or unconscionability may enable the signer to avoid the obligation. Further, reasonable notice of a contract's terms must be given to the other party prior to their entry into the contract.&lt;ref name="Balmain New Ferry"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|83|1906|litigants=[[Balmain New Ferry Co Ltd v Robertson]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/83.pdf (1906) 4 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 379] |courtname=auto |date=18 December 1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltic Shipping v Dillon"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|4|1993|litigants=[[Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon]] |parallelcite=(1993) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 344 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unwritten, unspoken contract, also known as "a contract implied by the acts of the parties", which can be either an [[implied-in-fact contract]] or [[implied-in-law contract]], may also be legally binding. Implied-in-fact contracts are real contracts under which the parties receive the "benefit of the bargain".&lt;ref name="BP Refinery"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]] |year=1977 |court=UKPC |num=13 |format=1 |parallelcite=(1977) 180 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 266 |courtname=auto |juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, contracts implied in law are also known as quasi-contracts, and the remedy is [[quantum meruit]], the fair market value of goods or services rendered.

==Contract terms: construction and interpretation==
{{Main|Contractual term}}
A [[contractual term]] is "an[y] provision forming part of a contract".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, E [ed] &amp; Law, J [ed], ''Oxford Dictionary of Law'', ed6 (2006, London:OUP).&lt;/ref&gt; Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, [[breach of contract|breach]] of which can give rise to [[lawsuit|litigation]]. Not all [[Contractual Term|terms]] are stated expressly and some [[Contractual Term|terms]] carry less legal weight as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.

===Uncertainty, incompleteness and severance===
{{See also|Contra proferentem|Good faith (law)}}
If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fry v. Barnes]] (1953) 2 D.L.R. 817 (B.C.S.C)&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as [[Contract price|price]] or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to [[commercial contract]]s where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hillas and Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd.]]'' (1932) 147 LT 503&lt;/ref&gt; In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd'' (1999) 153 FLR 236 [http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/au/files/720502512/aiton_australia_v_transfield.pdf Thompson Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts may also look to external standards, which are either mentioned explicitly in the contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|71|1968|litigants=[[Whitlock v Brew]] |parallelcite=(1968) 118 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 445 |date=31 October 1968 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or implied by [[common practice]] in a certain field.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Three Rivers Trading Co., Ltd. v. Gwinear &amp; District Farmers, Ltd.]]'' (1967) 111 Sol. J. 831&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the court may also imply a term; if price is excluded, the court may imply a reasonable price, with the exception of land, and second-hand goods, which are unique.

If there are uncertain or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, it may be possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a [[severability clause]]. The test of whether a clause is severable is an [[objective test]]—whether a [[reasonable person]] would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Cutter v Powell]]" (1795) 101 ER 573&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of terms===
Contractual terms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.upcounsel.com/types-of-contractual-terms|title=Types Of Contractual Terms: Everything You Need to Know|website=UpCounsel|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are classified differently depending upon the context or jurisdiction. Terms establish [[conditions precedent]]. English (but not necessarily non-English) common law distinguishes between important ''conditions'' and [[warranty|warranties]], with a breach of a condition by one party allowing the other to repudiate and be discharged while a warranty allows for remedies and damages but not complete discharge.&lt;ref name="Gillies"&gt;Gillies P. (1988). ''Concise Contract Law'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=H0MdPMgEMbAC&amp;pg=PA105 p. 105]. Federation Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luna Park v Tramways"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|66|1938|litigants=[[Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/66.pdf (1938) 61 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Rpeorts}} 286] |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not a term is a ''condition'' is determined in part by the parties' intent.&lt;ref name="Luna Park v Tramways"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koffman L, MacDonald E. (2007). ''The Law of Contract''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a less technical sense, however, a condition is a generic term and a warranty is a promise.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt; Not all language in the contract is determined to be a contractual term. Representations, which are often precontractual, are typically less strictly enforced than terms, and material misrepresentations historically was a cause of action for the [[tort of deceit]]. Warranties were enforced regardless of materiality; in modern United States law the distinction is less clear but warranties may be enforced more strictly.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; Statements of opinion may be viewed as "mere puff".

In specific circumstances these terms are used differently. For example, in English insurance law, violation of a "condition precedent" by an insured is a complete defense against the payment of claims.&lt;ref name=Burling2011/&gt;{{rp|160}} In general insurance law, a warranty is a promise that must be complied with.&lt;ref name=Burling2011&gt;Burling JM. (2011). Research Handbook on International Insurance Law and Regulation. Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In product transactions, warranties promise that the product will continue to function for a certain period of time.

In the United Kingdom the courts determine whether a term is a condition or warranty; for example, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a [[theatre|theatrical]] production is a ''condition'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Poussard v Spiers and Pond]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 410&lt;/ref&gt; but a singer's obligation to rehearse may be a warranty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 183&lt;/ref&gt; [[Statute]] may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] s15A&lt;ref&gt;As added by the Sale of Goods Act 1994 s4(1).&lt;/ref&gt; provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample are generally ''conditions''. The United Kingdom has also contrived the concept of an "intermediate term" (also called innominate), first established in ''[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]]'' [1962].

===Representations versus warranties===
Statements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either [[warranty|warranties]] or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action (such as the [[tort of deceit]]) if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent;&lt;ref name=Primack2009&gt;Primack MA. (2009). [http://www.natlawreview.com/article/representations-warranties-and-covenants-back-to-basics-contracts Representations, Warranties and Covenants: Back to the Basics in Contracts]. ''National Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; historically a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, breach of warranty became a separate legal contractual action.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear;&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009&gt;West GD, Lewis WB. (2009). [http://www.weil.com/files/Publication/563ccf98-648d-4e5b-b3e5-129805230615/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/fb77618a-f943-4797-98a1-2a69d92a4522/Extra-Contractual%20Liability%20Article.pdf Contracting to Avoid Extra-Contractual Liability—Can Your Contractual Deal Ever Really Be the "Entire" Deal?] ''The Business Lawyer''.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]], while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common.&lt;ref name=JonesDay2007&gt;Ferara LN, Philips J, Runnicles J. (2007). [http://www.jonesday.com/some-differences-in-law-and-practice-between-uk-and-us-stock-purchase-agreements-04-13-2007/ Some Differences in Law and Practice Between U.K. and U.S. Stock Purchase Agreements]. ''Jones Day Publications''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words;&lt;ref name=Primack2009/&gt; however, others disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Telman J. (2012). [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/contractsprof_blog/2012/05/representations-and-warranties.html Representations and Warranties]. ContractsProf Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements in a contract may not be upheld if the court finds that the statements are subjective or promotional [[puffery]]. English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of ''Bannerman v White''&lt;ref&gt;''Bannerman v White'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/713.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[1861]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom).&lt;/ref&gt; the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of ''Bissett v Wilkinson''&lt;ref name="Bissett v Wilkinson"&gt;''Bissett v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion.

===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion===
[[Standard form contract]]s contain "boilerplate", which is a set of "[[one size fits all]]" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and [[force majeure]]. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power ("contracts of adhesion") attract [[consumer protection]] scrutiny.

===Implied terms===
A term may either be express or implied&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/implied-terms-in-a-contract-definition-explanation.html|title=Implied Terms in a Contract: Definition &amp; Explanation - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.

====Terms implied in fact====
Terms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]'',&lt;ref name="BP Refinery"/&gt; the UK [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], on appeal from Australia, proposed a five-stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the "business efficacy test" and the "officious bystander test". Under the "business efficacy test" first proposed in ''[[The Moorcock]]'' [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in ''[[Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw]]'' [1940] but actually originating in ''Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd'' [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an "officious bystander" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable.

====Terms implied in law====
[[Statute]]s or [[common law|judicial rulings]] may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]] in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[India]] imply a similar good faith term through laws.

In England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require [[Uberrima fides|utmost good faith]], while others may require [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do '''not''' need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of "[[legitimate expectation]]".

Most [[Country|countries]] have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied [[warranty]] of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability.

In the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by:
* Statute, such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] and the [[Hague-Visby Rules]];
* Common Law, such as ''[[The Moorcock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the "business efficacy" test;
* Previous Dealings, as in [[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw|''Spurling v Bradshaw'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1956] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 121 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Custom, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hutton v Warren]]'' [1836] M&amp;W 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terms implied by custom====
A term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context. In the [[Australia]]n case of ''[[Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur (Aust) Limited]]'',&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the requirements for a term to be implied by custom were set out. For a term to be implied by custom it needs to be "so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term into the contract".&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"/&gt;{{rp|paras 8–9}}

==Third parties==
{{Main|Third party beneficiary}}
The common law doctrine of privity of contract provides that only those who are party to a contract may sue or be sued on it.&lt;ref&gt;''Dunlop v Selfridge' [1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beswick v Beswick [1968] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 58 [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; The leading case of ''Tweddle v Atkinson'' [1861] &lt;ref&gt;''Tweddle v Atkinson'' [1861] 121 ER 762&lt;/ref&gt; immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In [[maritime law]], the cases of ''Scruttons v Midland Silicones'' [1962] &lt;ref&gt;''Scruttons v Midland Silicones'' [1962] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 446 [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite'' [1975],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |year=1974 |court=UKPC |num=4 |litigants=NZ Shipping v Satterthwaite |parallelcite=[1975] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 154 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a [[bill of lading]].
Some common law exceptions such as [[agency (law)|agency]], [[Assignment (law),|assignment]] and [[negligence]] allowed some circumvention of privity rules,&lt;ref&gt;Adler v Dickson [1955] QB 158&lt;/ref&gt; but the unpopular&lt;ref&gt;Lord Denning declared that the doctrine had been abolished by 1925 property legislation, but he was overruled by the House of Lords.&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine remained intact until it was amended by the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] which provides:&lt;ref&gt;The 1999 Act does not cover contracts for the carriage of goods by sea, which are instead  subject to the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A person who is not a party to a contract  (a “third party”) may in his own right enforce a contract if:
	(a) the contract expressly provides that he may, or
	(b) the contract purports to confer a benefit on him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Performance==
Performance varies according to the particular circumstances. While a contract is being performed, it is called an [[executory contract]], and when it is completed it is an executed contract. In some cases there may be [[substantial performance]] but not complete performance, which allows the performing party to be partially compensated.

==Defences==
[[Vitiating factors in the law of contract|Vitiating factors]] constituting defences to purported contract formation include:
* [[Mistake (contract law)|Mistake]] (such as ''[[non est factum]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch10s02s05.php|title=Are you bound once you sign a contract?|last=|first=|date=11 December 2009|website=Legal Services Commission of South Australia|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Capacity (law)|Incapacity]], including mental incompetence and infancy/minority
* [[Duress#In contract law|Duress]]
* [[Undue influence]]
* [[Unconscionability]]
* [[Misrepresentation]] or fraud
* [[Frustration of purpose]]
Such defenses operate to determine whether a purported contract is either (1)&amp;nbsp;void or (2)&amp;nbsp;voidable. Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party. Voidable contracts ''can'' be ratified.

===Misrepresentation===
{{Main|Misrepresentation}}
Misrepresentation means a false statement of fact made by one party to another party and has the effect of inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation.

There are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.

According to ''[[Gordon v Selico]]'' [1986] it is possible to misrepresent either by words or conduct. Generally, statements of opinion or intention are not statements of fact in the context of misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="Bissett v Wilkinson"/&gt; If one party claims specialist knowledge on the topic discussed, then it is more likely for the courts to hold a statement of opinion by that party as a statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt;''Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon'' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a fallacy that an opinion cannot be a statement of fact. If a statement is the honest expression of an opinion honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves any fraudulent misrepresentations of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|19|1928|litigants=Fitzpatrick v Michel |parallelcite=(1928) 28 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 285 |date=2 April 1928 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedies for misrepresentation. Rescission is the principal remedy and damages are also available if a tort is established. In order to obtain relief, there must be a positive misrepresentation of law and also, the representee must have been misled by and relied on this misrepresentation:''Public Trustee v Taylor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|31|1978|litigants=Public Trustee v Taylor |parallecite=[1978] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 289 |date=9 September 1977 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mistake===
{{Main|Mistake (contract law)}}
A mistake is an incorrect understanding by one or more parties to a contract and may be used as grounds to invalidate the agreement. Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.
*'''Common mistake''' occurs when both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of ''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'' [1931] ALL E.R. Rep. 1, [1932] A.C. 161&lt;/ref&gt; which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.&lt;ref name="Svanosi v McNamara"&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1956|litigants=Svanosi v McNamara |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd'', the court held that the common law will grant relief against common mistake, if the test in ''Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd'' is made out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2002 |num=1407 |litigants=Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If one party has knowledge and the other does not, and the party with the knowledge promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter, that party will be in breach if the subject matter does not exist.&lt;ref name="McRae v Commonwealth"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|79|1951|litigants=[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.pdf (1951) 84 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 377] |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mutual mistake''' occurs when both parties of a contract are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'' (1864) 2 Hurl. &amp; C. 906.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Unilateral mistake''' occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Smith v. Hughes]] [1871].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor v Johnson"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1983|litigants=[[Taylor v Johnson]] |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in ''Lewis v Avery''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=4 |year=1971 |litigants=Lewis v Avery |parallelcite=[1971] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 907 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Lord Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.

===Duress and undue influence===
{{Main|Duress (contract law)|Undue influence}}
Duress has been defined as a "threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition."&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; An example is in ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract. There can also be duress to goods and sometimes, 'economic duress'.

Undue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1982|litigants=Westmelton (Vic) Pty Ltd v Archer and Shulman |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Odorizzi v. Bloomfield Sch. Dist.'', 246 Cal. App. 2d 123 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscionable dealing===
{{Main|Unconscionability}}
In Australian law, a contract can be set aside due to unconscionable dealing.&lt;ref name="CBA v Amadio"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1983|litigants=[[Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio]] |parallelcite=(1983) 151 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 447 |courtname=auto |date=12 May 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blomley v Ryan"&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|81|1956|litigants=[[Blomley v Ryan]] |parallelcite=(1956) 99 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 362 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the claimant must show that they were under a special disability, the test for this being that they were unable to act in their best interest. Secondly, the claimant must show that the defendant took advantage of this special disability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://consumerlaw.gov.au/the-australian-consumer-law/legislation/|title=Legislation – Australian Consumer Law|website=consumerlaw.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="CBA v Amadio"/&gt;

===Illegal contracts===
{{Main|Illegal agreement}}
If based on an illegal purpose or contrary to [[public policy]], a contract is ''void''. In the 1996 [[Canada|Canadian]] case of ''Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell''&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell'' 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.C.S.A.). [http://canlii.ca/en/ns/nssc/doc/1996/1996canlii5486/1996canlii5486.html 1996 case] and [http://canlii.ca/en/ns/nsca/doc/1997/1997canlii9871/1997canlii9871.html 1997 appeal].&lt;/ref&gt; a woman forged her husband's signature, and her husband signed agreed to assume "all liability and responsibility" for the forged checks. However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to "stifle a criminal prosecution", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.

In the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tenet v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|544|1|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than [[minimum wage]] and forfeiting the right to [[workman's compensation]] in cases where workman's compensation is due.

===Remedies for defendant on defenses===

====Setting aside the contract====
There can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed '[[void (law)|void]]', '[[voidable]]', '[[unenforceable]]' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the "killed" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy [[public procurement]] law. To [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] is to set aside or unmake a contract.

==Disputes==
===Procedure===
In many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=E. Allen|title=Legal Remedies for Breach of Contract|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=November 1970|volume=70|issue=7|pages=1145–1216|jstor=1121184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], a contract may be enforced by use of a [[claim (legal)|claim]], or in urgent cases by applying for an [[interim injunction]] to prevent a breach. Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowan|first1=Solène|title=Remedies for Breach of Contract: A Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199606609|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TofAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arbitration====
If the contract contains a valid [[arbitration]] clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.

Arbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]], which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=A.A.|title=Circumventing the Supremacy Clause - Understanding the Constitutional Implications of the United States' Treatment of Treaty Obligations through an Analysis of the New York Convention|journal=San Diego International Law Journal|date=2005|volume=7|page=491|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sdintl7&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute. For example, disputes regarding validity of registered IP rights may need to be resolved by a public body within the national registration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Arbitration in Intellectual Property?|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/why-is-arb.html|website=WIPO|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For matters of significant public interest that go beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement, such as  claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or committed civil rights violations, a court might find that the parties may litigate some or all of their claims even before completing a contractually agreed arbitration process.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Harry T.|title=Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration Awards: The Clash Between the Public Policy Exception and the Duty to Bargain|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|date=1988|volume=64|issue=1|page=4|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2709&amp;context=cklawreview|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In the United States, thirty-five states (notably not including New York)&lt;ref&gt;New York Civil Procedure Law and Rules § 7501, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; and the District of Columbia have adopted the [[Uniform Arbitration Act]] to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniform Arbitration Act (1956 Act or 2000 Act)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol7#arbit|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer claims against securities brokers and dealers are almost always resolved pursuant to contractual arbitration clauses, because securities dealers are required under the terms of their membership in self-regulatory organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (formerly the NASD) or [[NYSE]] to arbitrate disputes with their customers. The firms then began including arbitration agreements in their customer agreements, requiring their customers to arbitrate disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernard|first1=Tara S.|title=Taking a Broker to Arbitration|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/your-money/a-closer-look-at-the-arbitration-process-for-investors.html|accessdate=13 August 2017|agency=New York Times|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cleaver|first1=Joanne|title=What Your Financial Advisor’s Mandatory Arbitration Clause Means for You|url=https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/articles/2014/08/28/what-your-financial-advisors-mandatory-arbitration-clause-means-for-you|accessdate=13 August 2017|agency=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Choice of law====
When a contract dispute arises between parties that are in different jurisdictions, law that is applicable to a contract is dependent on the [[conflict of laws]] analysis by the court where the breach of contract action is filed In the absence of a [[choice of law clause]], the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Common Contract Clauses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_clauses.html#choice-of-law-and-forum-clause|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=James J.|title=Consumer Protection Choice of Law: European Lessons for the United States|journal=Duke Journal of Comparative &amp; International Law|date=2008|volume=19|page=535|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=djcil|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the [[Rome I Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32008R0593|website=Eur-Lex|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Choice of forum====
Many contracts contain a [[forum selection clause]] setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.

A choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law|title=Commercial law: Contract law|last=|first=|date=|website=Monash University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word "exclusive" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more [[forum non conveniens|convenient forum]] for the litigation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Mullenix|first1=Linda A.|title=Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|page=291|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr57&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen courts to dismiss cases, and require the recognition of judgements made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the [[Brussels regime]] instruments (31 European states) and the [[Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention]] (European Union and Mexico), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments.

===Remedies===
{{Main|Breach of contract}}
In the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as:  [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected.  Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),&lt;ref&gt;[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1951|litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164&lt;/ref&gt; but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.

It was not possible to sue [[the Crown]] in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a [[petition of right]] that needed to be endorsed by the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]]. S.1 [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person.

====Damages====
{{Main|Damages}}
There are several different types of damages.
*Compensatory damages, which are given to the party which was detrimented by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two [[heads of loss]], consequential damage and direct damage.
*Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called "penalty clauses" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |year=1914 |court=UKHL |num=1 |litigants=[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 at 86 per Lord Dunedin |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.
*Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award.  Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions.  In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud.  Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages.

Compensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible.  They may be "expectation damages", "reliance damages" or "[[restitution]]ary damages".  Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |date=20 August 1954 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]''&lt;ref name="McRae v Commonwealth"/&gt; which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In ''Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed''&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 1 QB 60&lt;/ref&gt; the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance.

After a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps.  Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] states, "Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise." UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is ''British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London''[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Professor Michael Furmston &lt;ref&gt;M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss",&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130.&lt;/ref&gt; citing ''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt'' [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605.&lt;/ref&gt; If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an [[anticipatory breach]] occurs.

Damages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.

To recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.&lt;ref name="Hadley v Baxendale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd'' (1987) 9 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 310.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective.  In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge?  On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the "reasonable man" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.

====Specific performance====
{{Main|Specific performance}}
There may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.

The court may make an order of what is called "specific performance", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of "[[specific performance]]") or issue an order, known as an "injunction", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the [[United States]] by way of the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal "''as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[Equity (law)|equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]], the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.

Related to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract.

==History==
{{main|History of contract law|Roman law}}

Whilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage.  In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the [[English law|English common law]] led to a swift development of English&lt;ref&gt;as opposed to Scottish law&lt;/ref&gt; contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind.&lt;ref&gt;In 1789, while the French were engaged in their revolution, the English law was busying itself in defining the rules of auctions: see [[Payne v Cave]]&lt;/ref&gt; Colonies within the British empire (including the [[United States|USA]] and [[Dominion|the Dominions]]) would [[Reception statute|adopt the law]] of the mother country.  Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law.  In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]],&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, &amp; Dixon, B 2009 ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; to promote uniform regulations.

Contract law is based on the principle expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]],'' ( "agreements must be kept").&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wehberg]], ''[[Pacta Sunt Servanda]],'' [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), [http://www.trans-lex.org/129500 p.775.]; Trans-Lex.org [http://www.trans-lex.org/919000 Principle of Sanctity of contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of [[assumpsit]], which was originally a [[tort]] action based on reliance.&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah PS.

''Law and Contemporary Problems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Contract law falls within the general [[law of obligations]], along with [[tort]], [[unjust enrichment]], and [[restitution]].&lt;ref&gt;However, a movement in the 1990s to replace the separate teaching of contract and tort with a unified law of "obligations" has met with little success.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions vary in their principles of [[freedom of contract]]. In common law jurisdictions such as  England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in [[Law of the United States|American law]], it was determined in the 1901 case of ''[[Hurley v. Eddingfield]]'' that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.&lt;ref&gt;Blake V. (2012). [http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/05/hlaw1-1205.html When Is a Patient-Physician Relationship Established?]. ''Virtual Mentor''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract, as in the [[French Civil Code]]. Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations.

However, in both the [[European union]] and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; For example, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas D. (2002). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=facpubs Contract Rights and Civil Rights]. ''Michigan Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the United States underwent the "[[Lochner era]]", in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down economic regulations on the basis of freedom of contract and the [[Due Process Clause]]; these decisions were eventually overturned and the Supreme Court established a deference to legislative statutes and regulations which restrict freedom of contract.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;Bernstein DE. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1239749 Freedom of Contract]. George Mason Law &amp; Economics Research Paper No. 08-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Constitution contains a [[Contract Clause]], but this has been interpreted as only restricting the retroactive impairment of contracts.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt;

==Commercial use==
Contracts are widely used in [[commercial law]], and form the legal foundation for transactions across the world. Common examples include [[contract of sale|contracts for the sale]] of [[professional service|services]] and goods (both wholesale and retail), [[construction law|construction contracts]], [[Contract of carriage|contracts of carriage]], [[software license]]s, [[employment contract]]s, [[insurance policy|insurance policies]], sale or lease of land, and various other uses.

Although the [[European Union]] is fundamentally an economic community with a range of trade rules, there is no overarching "EU Law of Contract". In 1993, [[Harvey McGregor]], a British barrister and academic, produced a "Contract Code" under the auspices of the English and Scottish [[Law Commission]]s, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible "Contract Code for Europe", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.&lt;ref&gt;... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract theory==
Contract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with [[Charles Fried]], maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realists]] and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.

More generally, writers have propounded [[Marxist]] and feminist interpretations of contract.  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably [[Relational contract|relational contract theory]] originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar [[Lon L. Fuller]], while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of [[transaction cost]] and so-called '[[efficient breach]]' theory.

Another dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider [[law of obligations]]. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in [[tort]] which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.

Recently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.&lt;ref&gt;Beatson, ''Anson's Law of Contract'' (1998) 27th ed. OUP, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law describes the circumstances under which the law will recognise the existence of rights, privilege or power arising out of a promise.

[[File:Cremieux 136.jpg|thumbnail|The decree]]
The '''Crémieux Decree''' ({{IPA-fr|kʁemjø|lang}}) was a law that granted [[French citizenship]] to the majority of the Jewish population in [[French Algeria]] (around 35,000), signed by the [[Government of National Defense]] on 24 October 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was named after [[French-Jewish]] lawyer and Minister of Justice [[Adolphe Crémieux]], who had founded the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] a decade earlier.

It was signed as Decree 136 of 1870&lt;ref&gt;({{cite French decree|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 136|date in French=24 octobre 1870|lower case=yes}})&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Adolphe Crémieux]] as Minister of Justice, [[Léon Gambetta]] as Minister of the Interior, [[Alexandre Glais-Bizoin]] and [[:fr:Martin Fourichon|Martin Fourichon]] as a naval and colonial minister. The ministers were members of the military government in Tours, the Gouvernement de la Défense nationale, since France was still at war, and the provisional government had its seat in Tours.

At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l'indigénat.

The decree allowed for native [[Jews]] to automatically become [[French citizens]] while [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]] were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the [[Indigénat|Code de l'Indigénat]]. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted. That set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities and proved fateful in the [[Algerian War of Independence]], after which the vast majority of the French Jews of Algeria emigrated to France.

Decrees 136 and 137 were published in Official Gazette of the City Tours (''Bulletin officielle de la ville de Tours'') on 7 November 1870.

From 1940 to 1943, the Crémieux Decree was abolished under the Vichy regime.

==Text of the decree==
{|class="messagebox"
|
French Republic
No. 136. - Declaring the indigenous Jews of Algeria French citizens.
24 October 1870.

The Government of National Defense Decrees:

The indigenous Jews of the departments of Algeria are declared French citizens; therefore, their actual status and personal status will, after the promulgation of this decree, be settled by French law, any rights acquired to date remaining inviolable.

Any legislative provision, any [[Sénatus-consulte]], decree, regulation or ordinance to the contrary is abolished.

Done at Tours, 24 October 1870

Signed Ad. Cremieux, L. Gambetta, AL. Glais-Bizoin, L. Fourichon

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a number of countries have passed laws aimed at reducing [[discrimination against people with disabilities]]. These laws have begun to appear as the notion of [[civil rights]] has become more influential globally, and follow other forms of [[List of anti-discrimination acts|anti-discrimination]] and [[equal opportunity]] legislation aimed at preventing [[racial discrimination]] and [[sexism]] which began to emerge in the second half of the 20th century. Many of these Acts aim to reduce barriers for persons with disabilities in the areas of customer service, employment, built environment, transportation, and information and communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/a001-7e.php|title=Manitoba Laws|first=Manitoba|last=Justice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite bailii|litigants='''Donoghue v Stevenson'''|year=1932|court=UKHL|num=100}} was a [[Lists of landmark court decisions|landmark court decision]] in [[Scots delict law]] and [[English tort law]] by the [[House of Lords]]. It laid the foundation of the modern law of [[negligence]], establishing general principles of the [[duty of care]].

==Outline==
Also known as the "Paisley snail"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wylie |first=A. F. |title=The Paisley Snail MiniTrial |url=http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/dvs/minitrial/ |website=Donoghue v Stevenson Digital Resources |publisher=Scottish Council of Law Reporting |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paisley Snail|url=http://www.paisleyonline.co.uk/html/paisley_snail.html |publisher=Paisley Online |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "snail in the bottle" case, the case involved Mrs Donoghue drinking a bottle of [[ginger beer]] in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]]. A dead snail was in the bottle. She fell ill, and she sued the ginger beer manufacturer, Mr Stevenson. The House of Lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her, which was breached, because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the product's safety would lead to harm to consumers. There was also a sufficiently proximate relationship between consumers and product manufacturers. 

Prior to ''Donoghue v Stevenson'', liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly ([[trespass to the person]]) or indirectly ([[trespass on the case]]).  Being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either, so the orthodox view was that Mrs Donoghue had no sustainable claim in law.  However, the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims.  This was an evolutionary step in the [[common law]] for tort and delict, moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system which only required injury.  This evolution was taken further in the later decision of ''[[Letang v Cooper]]'' [1965] 1 QB 232 when it was held that actions should not be jointly [[pleading|pleaded]] in trespass and negligence, but in negligence alone.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

The ginger beer had been manufactured by David Stevenson, who ran a company producing both ginger beer and [[lemonade]] at 11 and 12 Glen Lane, Paisley, less than a mile away from the Wellmeadow Café.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} The contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by Donoghue's friend.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed Walter Leechman, a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case, ''[[Mullen v AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd]]'',&lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Mullen v AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd |vol=1929 |reporter=SC |opinion=461 |court=[[ScotCS]] |date=20 March 1929 |url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/1929/1929_SC_461.html |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than three weeks earlier &lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt; (see also ''[[George v Skivington]]'').

Despite the ruling in ''Mullen'', Leechman issued a [[writ]] on Donoghue's behalf against Stevenson on 9 April 1929.&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC report"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Donoghue v Stevenson |vol=1932 |reporter=SC (HL) |opinion=31 |court=[[UKHL]] |date=26 May 1932 |url=http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/dvs/donoghue-v-stevenson-report.html |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} The writ claimed [[pound sterling|£]]500 in [[damages]], the same amount a claimant in ''Mullen'' had recovered at [[first instance]], and £50 in costs.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|4}} The total amount Donoghue attempted to recover would be equivalent to at least £27,000 {{as of|2012|alt=in 2012}}.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ |title=UK £ relative values |website=Measuring Worth |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condescendences===
The full allegations made by Donoghue were presented in five condescendences, which claimed that Stevenson had a [[duty of care]] to Donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer, but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively, a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|22–23}} The ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places "to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access ... and in which, indeed, snails and snail trails were frequently found",&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|6}} an allegation described by Matthew Chapman as "somewhat gratuitous".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|7}} This breach of duty was alleged to have [[causation (law)|caused]] Donoghue's [[harm|subsequent illness]].&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and "that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated ... any illness suffered by the [claimant] was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time".&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} In response to the writ, Stevenson pleaded (1) that the claim had no legal basis, (2) that the facts could not be substantiated, (3) that he had not caused Donoghue any injury and (4) that the claimed amount was excessive.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|22–23}}&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

===Legal background===
Injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a [[contract of sale]] between the seller and the consumer.&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt; However, Donoghue had no [[contractual]] relationship with Minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer; while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order, she had not suffered any injury. Moreover, neither had a contract with Stevenson, the manufacturer.&lt;ref name="The legal case of the snail found in ginger beer" /&gt; Donoghue was therefore required to claim [[damages]] for [[negligence]].&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;

''[[Ansell v Waterhouse]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ansell v Waterhouse |vol=1817 |reporter=M &amp; S |opinion=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; had established in 1817 that [[legal liability]] could arise for an act or omission "contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case" (i.e. negligence).&lt;ref name="Text and Materials"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lunney |first1=Mark |last2=Oliphant |first2=Ken |title=Tort Law: Text and Materials |edition=4 |year=2010 |origyear=2000 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199571802}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105–106}} However, there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour. Only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances, most of which had a contractual background.&lt;ref name="Snail trail" /&gt;{{rp|643}}&lt;ref name="Text and Materials" /&gt;{{rp|109}}&lt;ref name="Donoghue v.

The most difficult [[precedent]] for Donoghue was ''Mullen v AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd'', a recent Court of Session case. In ''Mullen'', two children, John and Francis Mullen, and Jeanie Oribine had separately found dead [[mice]] in their bottles of ginger beer, manufactured by AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd, and claimed to have [[personal injury|become ill]] through drinking the tainted liquid. In separate hearings in Glasgow and [[Greenock]] [[Sheriff Court]] respectively, Orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the Mullens were not. The losing parties of both cases appealed to the Court of Session.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

At the Court of Session, the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer, negligence could be presumed ([[res ipsa loquitur]]) from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles. However, the court ruled against the claimants.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}} The majority held that on a factual basis AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties; if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer (in which case there might also be a claim for [[fraud]]); or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products, such as [[explosives]].&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Only [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|Lord Hunter]] [[dissenting opinion|dissented]], finding that negligence to be [[inferred]] and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined (because of the dark glass) gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

However, neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in [[product liability]] cases applied to Donoghue: ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous, nor did Stevenson intentionally [[misrepresent]] the threat it posed. Nevertheless, Donoghue's [[counsel]] argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used, an exception that would apply to Donoghue.&lt;ref name="The legal case of the snail found in ginger beer" /&gt;

==Judgment==
===Court of Session, Outer House===
[[File:Parliament House, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|alt=A modern photograph of Parliament House|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] in Edinburgh, where the Court of Session sits]]
The first [[interlocutory]] action was heard on the Court of Session on 21 May 1929 in front of [[Alexander Moncrieff, Lord Moncrieff|Lord Moncrieff]]. After an [[adjournment]], Minghella was added as a [[defendant|defender]] on 5 June; however, the claim against him was abandoned on 19 November, likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with Donoghue (Donoghue's friend had purchased the ginger beer) and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle. On 12 December, Minghella and Stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £108 6[[shillings|s]] 3[[old pence|d]] against Donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation. However, it was recorded on 20 December that Donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to Minghella.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|23–25}}

The case was heard by Lord Moncrieff in the [[Outer House]] on 27 June 1930. In his judgment, delivered on the same day, he held that, as a general principle, there should be liability for negligent preparation of [[food]].&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|25–26}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products, as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture ... Tainted food when offered for sale is, in my opinion, amongst the most subtly potent of 'dangerous goods', and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty. I fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself, should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty, or afford him a supplementary defence.&lt;ref name="Opinions"&gt;{{cite book |title=Donoghue v Stevenson Appeal Papers: The Appendix (Opinions) |publisher=Chapman, Watson &amp; Co |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url=http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/dvs/page-text/index-appendix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4,6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[English law|English case law]] that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis ([[breach of warranty]]) was dismissed by Lord Moncrieff (citing [[John William Salmond|John Salmond]]) for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into [[Scots law]].&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|26–27}}&lt;ref name="Opinions"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} Finally, ''Mullen'', despite its factual similarity, was discounted by a "very close reading of the precedent opinions".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|27–29}}&lt;ref name="Opinions"/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}

===Court of Session, Inner House===
Stevenson appealed the case to the [[Inner House]], where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against Mullen: [[Robert Munro, 1st Baron Alness|Lord Alness]] (the [[Lord Justice-Clerk]]), [[Lord Ormidale]], [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|Lord Hunter]] and [[Andrew Anderson, Lord Anderson|Lord Anderson]].&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|29}} In their judgment, given on 13 November 1930,&lt;ref name="Opinions" /&gt;{{rp|21}} they all referred back to and supported their statements in ''Mullen'', Lord Alness observing that "the only difference — and, so far as I can see, it is not a material difference — between that case [''Mullen''] and this case [''Donoghue''] is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a ginger-beer bottle, and here we are dealing with a snail in a ginger-beer bottle".&lt;ref name="Opinions" /&gt;{{rp|22}} Thus, Lord Alness, Lord Ormidale and Lord Anderson all allowed the appeal while Lord Hunter dissented.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|29–30}}

===House of Lords===
Donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on 25 February 1931.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|32}} She also sought (and subsequently received) permission to pursue the case ''[[in forma pauperis]]'' (with the status of a [[pauper]]) – a status she had not, for unknown reasons, sought at the Court of Session&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|33–34}} – providing an [[affidavit]] declaring that "I am very poor, and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds, my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted...".&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt; This claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that Donoghue was not required to provide [[security for costs]] in case she lost the appeal.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|34}} (Her legal team had agreed to work ''[[pro bono]]''.&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;)

[[File:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A modern photograph of the Palace of Westminster at night from across the River Thames|The [[Palace of Westminster]], where five [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] heard Donoghue's appeal]]
The petition was granted and the appeal was heard 10 and 11 December 1931 by [[Stanley Buckmaster, 1st Viscount Buckmaster|Lord Buckmaster]], [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]], [[Thomas Tomlin, Baron Tomlin|Lord Tomlin]], [[William Watson, Baron Thankerton|Lord Thankerton]] and [[Hugh Macmillan, Baron Macmillan|Lord Macmillan]]. A supplementary statement from Donoghue's appeal papers indicates that her counsel, George Morton [[King's Counsel|KC]] and [[William Rankine Milligan, Lord Milligan|William Milligan]] (later the [[Lord Advocate]] and a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]]), argued that "where anyone performs an operation, such as the manufacture of an article, a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise, the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case".&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Stevenson, they argued, owed a duty to take [[reasonable care]] in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque, and therefore could not be examined, and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|35–37}}&lt;ref name="Appellant's Case" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

Stevenson's counsel, [[Wilfrid Normand]] KC ([[Solicitor General for Scotland]] and later a [[Law Lord]]) and [[James Latham Clyde, Lord Clyde|James Clyde]] (later the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] and a Privy Counsellor), responded that "it is now firmly established both in English and Scottish law that in the ordinary case (which this is) the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation".&lt;ref name="Respondent's Case"&gt;{{cite book |title=Donoghue v Stevenson Appeal Papers: The Respondent's Case |last1=Normand |first1=W.

The House of Lords gave judgment on 26 May 1932 after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearing.{{refn|Judgment was originally scheduled for 14 April, but was delayed for unknown reasons (although [[Alan Roger]] suggests that the delay gave Lord Macmillan time to rewrite his speech).&lt;ref name="Lord Macmillan's speech"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodger |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Roger |title=Lord Macmillan's speech in Donoghue v Stevenson |journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]] |date=April 1992 |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=236–259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247}}|group=Note}}&lt;ref name="Lord Macmillan's speech" /&gt;{{rp|236–237}} The court held by a [[majority]] of 3–2 that Donoghue's case disclosed a cause of action.&lt;ref name="AC report" /&gt;{{rp|562}} The majority consisted of Lord Atkin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan.&lt;ref name="AC report" /&gt;{{rp|562}}

[[Lord Atkin]] commented that he did "not think a more important problem has occupied your Lordships in your judicial capacity, important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises".&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|43}} He agreed with counsel, based on his own research, that Scots and English law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|40–41}}

{{Cquote|At present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be, and is, some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances. The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of "culpa," is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot, in a practical world, be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question."&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|44}}}}

He supported this broad test by citing ''[[Heaven v Pender]]''&lt;ref name="Heaven v Pender"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Heaven v Pender |vol=1883 11 |reporter=QBD |opinion=503 |court=[[EWCA]] |year=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food, for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer. "If this were the result of the authorities, I should consider the result a grave defect in the law, and so contrary to principle that I should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this House".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|44–46}} He went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of "articles of common household use", listing [[pharmaceutical drug|medicine]], [[soap]] and [[cleaning products]] as examples. "I do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilised society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong."&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|46}}

Lord Atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]''&lt;ref name="MacPherson"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. |vol=217 |reporter=NY |opinion=382 |court=[[New York Court of Appeals]] |date=14 March 1916 |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of his view.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|46–56}}

He concluded:

{{Cquote|If your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action, you will be affirming the proposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him, with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.

It is a proposition which I venture to say no one in Scotland or England who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt. It will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter, as in most others, is in accordance with sound common sense. I think that this appeal should be allowed.&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|57}}}}

[[Lord Thankerton]] ruled that Donoghue had no contract with Stevenson, nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found. However, he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with, the manufacturer had "of his own accord, brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer, with the result that the consumer [was] entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer", an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to Donoghue.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|59–60}}

Lord Thankerton further argued that it was impossible "to catalogue finally, amid the ever-varying types of human relationships, those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract" and commented that he "should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the [seller] should relieve the [seller] of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|51–52}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

[[Lord Macmillan]] examined previous cases&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|65–70}} and held that "the law takes no cognisance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|46–47}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|70}} Whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the [[reasonable person]]. These circumstances "must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|70}} Lord Macmillan held that, according to this standard, Stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them; that he owed Donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink; and that Donoghue's injury was reasonably foreseeable. He therefore found that Donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was "happy to think that in ... relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents ... the principles of [English and Scots law] are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish."&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|47–48}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|71–72}}

The minority consisted of Lord Buckmaster and Lord Tomlin.&lt;ref name="AC report" /&gt;{{rp|562}} [[Lord Buckmaster]] focused on precedent, and commenced by warning that "although [common law] principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down, these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit".&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|35}} He held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported [[Baron Alderson]]'s judgment in ''[[Winterbottom v Wright]]'' that "the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract; if we go one step beyond that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|43–44}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

Lord Buckmaster dismissed ''[[George v Skivington]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=George v Skivington |vol=5 |reporter=LR Ex |opinion=1 |court=[[Exchequer of Pleas]] |year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; opining that "few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long",&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|37}} and rejected ''Heaven'' as a ''[[tabula in naufragio]]'' ([[Latin]]: literally "plank in a shipwreck") that was unrelated to Donoghue's case; both "should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law".&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|42}} He concluded that there was no [[common law]] support for Donoghue's claim and supported Lord Anderson's judgment in ''Mullen''.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|44–46}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a case like the present, where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout Scotland, it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works.

While he agreed with Lord Atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced, he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|50}}&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|57–58}} He further endorsed concerns that Lord Atkin's broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the [[Versailles rail accident]] to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the [[axle]] that broke and caused the crash.&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC report" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

The suggested ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' (Latin: the reason for the decision) of the case has varied from the narrowest, jokingly suggested by [[Julius Stone]], that there was merely a duty "not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to Scots widows",&lt;ref&gt;

Although the neighbour principle was a critical part of Lord Atkin's reasoning, and was therefore part of the ''ratio'' of his judgment, neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle.&lt;ref name="Donoghue v. Stevenson in Retrospect" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} [[Robert Heuston]] therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in [[tort]] even if there is a contract; that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods; and possibly that negligence is a separate tort. "No amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of ''obiter dictum'' [passing comments] to that of ''ratio decidendi''."&lt;ref name="Donoghue v. Stevenson in Retrospect" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Subsequent events===
The legal basis for the claim now settled, the case was returned to the Court of Session for a hearing scheduled for January 1933. In the hearing, Donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed, including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of Stevenson's negligence and that this snail had caused her illness.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|170}} However, Stevenson died on 12 November 1932, aged 69.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|7}} One year later, Stevenson's [[executors]] were listed as third-party defenders to the case. However, the claim was settled out of court in December 1934&lt;ref name="Text and Materials" /&gt;{{rp|115}} for, according to Leechman's son, £200 of the £500 originally claimed.{{refn|It has also been reported that the case was settled for £100 (by [[William McBryde]] on the basis of information from Lord Macmillan, which he probably heard from Lord Normand, one of Stevenson's counsel) and £500 (by Thomas Donoghue, May Donoghue's grandson; however, this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount Donoghue originally claimed).&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|173}}&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue and Alfenus Varus"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roger |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry |year=1988 |title=Mrs Donoghue and Alfenus Varus |journal=[[Current Legal Problems]] |volume=41 |pages=1–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}|group=Note}}&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|171–173}}

Donoghue had moved to 101 Maitland Street with her son, Henry, around February 1931; he moved out when he married in 1937, after which she moved to 156 Jamieson Street. She continued to work as a shop assistant. In February 1945, Donoghue divorced her husband, from whom she had separated in 1928 and who now had two sons by another woman, and reverted to using her maiden name.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}}&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue and Alfenus Varus" /&gt;{{rp|7}} She died of a [[heart attack]] on 19 March 1958, at the age of 59, in [[Gartloch Mental Hospital]], where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue and Alfenus Varus" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Although she is listed on her [[death certificate]] as May McAllister, she was by then commonly known as Mabel Hannah, having adopted her mother's maiden name and the first name of her daughter, who had died when she was eleven days old.&lt;ref name="The most famous litigant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue and Alfenus Varus" /&gt;{{rp|5,8}}&lt;ref name="Mabel Hannah’s Justice"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Rijswijk |first=Honni |year=2010 |title=Mabel Hannah's Justice: a contextual re-reading of Donoghue v Stevenson |journal=Public Space |volume=5 |pages=1–26 |url=http://epress.lib.uts.au/journals/index.php/publicspace/article/view/1903 |accessdate=26 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

Stevenson's business was taken over by his widow, Mary, and his son, the third David Stevenson in the family. It became a [[limited company]] (David Stevenson (Beers and Minerals) Limited) on 1 July 1950; the family sold their [[shares]] in 1956. The Glen Lane manufacturing plant was [[demolished]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The Wellmeadow Café, where the snail had been found, closed around 1931; the building was demolished in 1959. Minghella, its owner, subsequently became a labourer; he died on 20 March 1970.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

==Significance==
Lord Atkin's neighbour principle, that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction, was a response to a question a lawyer posed.&lt;ref name="Lord Atkin and the neighbour test"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castle |first=Richard |year=2003 |title=Lord Atkin and the neighbour test: origins of the principles of negligence in Donoghue v Stevenson |journal=[[Ecclesiastical Law Journal]] |volume=7 |issue=33 |pages=210–214 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x00005214}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 September 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212–213}}

The neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]]{{refn|Although authorship of ''An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius'' has also been attributed to [[Henry Bathurst, 2nd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]].&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|87}}|group=Note}} in ''An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius'', which was printed in 1768.&lt;ref name="Lord Atkin and the neighbour test" /&gt;{{rp|212}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'''Of Injuries arising from Negligence or Folly.''' Every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour; therefore, wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another, though the same were not wilful, yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly, the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius |last=Buller |first=Francis |authorlink=Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet |year=1817 |origyear=1768 |publisher=R Pheney and S Sweet |page=24b}} cited in {{cite journal |last=Castle |first=Richard |year=2003 |title=Lord Atkin and the neighbour test: origins of the principles of negligence in Donoghue v Stevenson |journal=[[Ecclesiastical Law Journal]] |volume=7 |issue=33 |pages=210–214 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x00005214}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 September 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In precedent, there was an [[obiter]] suggestion by [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] in ''Heaven v Pender'' that "whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense ... would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct ... he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger".&lt;ref name="Heaven v Pender" /&gt;{{rp|509}} However, this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="Text and Materials" /&gt;{{rp|107–108}} Lord Esher's attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in ''[[Le Lievre v Gould]]'',&lt;ref name="Le Lievre v Gould"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Le Lievre v Gould |vol=1893 1 |reporter=QB |opinion=491 |court=[[EWCA]] |date=3 February 1893 |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he stated that ''Heaven'' only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was [[distance|proximity]] between the parties, was also unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Text and Materials" /&gt;{{rp|108–109}}&lt;ref name="Le Lievre v Gould" /&gt;{{rp|497}}

Two cases from the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]''&lt;ref name="Thomas v. Winchester"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Thomas v. Winchester |vol=6 |reporter=NY |opinion=397 |court=[[New York Court of Appeals]] |date=July 1852 |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|102}} In ''Thomas'', Thomas had purchased and administered [[atropa belladonna|belladonna]] to his wife after it was mislabelled by Winchester, the dealer, although not the seller, of the treatment as [[extract of dandelion]]. Thomas' wife became seriously ill as a consequence and Thomas successfully claimed in negligence; Winchester's behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

This principle was relied on in ''MacPherson'', in which a car wheel collapsed, injuring MacPherson. The manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|104–106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Linden |first=Allen M. |authorlink=Allen Linden |date=December 2002 |title=The American influence on Canadian tort law |journal=University of California at Los Angeles Law Review |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=407–424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully ... If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow."&lt;ref name="MacPherson" /&gt;{{rp|389–390}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the [[University of Birmingham]]'s [[Holdsworth Club]] on 9 May 1930, in which he commented that "the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality, and the Law enforces that by an action for breach of contract".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|111}} On 28 October 1931, just over one month before he heard ''Donoghue'', Lord Atkin also used the principle in relation to [[defamation]], [[perjury]], [[fraud]] and negligence in a lecture at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name="Lord Atkin and the neighbour test" /&gt;{{rp|211}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A man] is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence; and that certainly covers a very large field of the law. I doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto you."{{refn|The original version of the [[Golden Maxim]] requires that "thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."&lt;ref name="Lord Atkin and the neighbour test" /&gt;{{rp|212}}&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#19:18|Leviticus 19:18 (King James)]]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name="Law as an Educational Subject"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Atkin |year=1932 |title=Law as an Educational Subject |journal=Journal of the Society of Public Teachers of Law |volume=1932 |pages=27–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Precedent===
The case was reviewed by [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] in a 1933 edition of [[Law Quarterly Review]], in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that "a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizen's duty before the law ... not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world".&lt;ref name="The Snail in the Bottle, and Thereafter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollock |first=Frederick |authorlink=Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet |year=1933 |title=The Snail in the Bottle, and Thereafter |journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} However, ''Donoghue'' otherwise attracted little attention; it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence.&lt;ref name="How the common law gets made"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buxton |first=Richard |year=2009 |title=How the common law gets made: Hedley Byrne and other cautionary tales |journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]] |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=60–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} The majority of the Court of Appeal ([[Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen|Lord Justice Cohen]] and [[Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone|Lord Justice Asquith]]) therefore held in ''[[Candler v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co]]''&lt;ref name="Candler v Crane"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Candler v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co |vol=1951 2 |reporter=KB |opinion=164 |court=[[EWCA]] |date=15 December 1950 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Donoghue'' had not affected tortious liability for [[negligent misstatement]].&lt;ref name="How the common law gets made" /&gt;{{rp|61}} This narrow understanding of ''Donoghue'' changed with the cases of ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]''&lt;ref name="Hedley Byrne v Heller"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hedley Byrne v Heller |vol=1964 |reporter=AC |opinion=465 |court=[[UKHL]] |date=28 May 1963 |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 and ''[[Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co]]''&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co |vol=1970 |reporter=AC |opinion=1004 |court=[[UKHL]] |date=6 May 1970 |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/2.html |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|116–117}}

===''Hedley Byrne v Heller''===
In ''Hedley Byrne'', Hedley Byrne, [[advertising agents]], had been indirectly informed by Heller &amp; Partners Ltd, the bankers of Easipower, a company wishing to place a large order, that Easipower was a "respectably constituted company, considered good for its ordinary business engagements".&lt;ref name="How the common law gets made" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Hedley Byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £17,000 when Easipower went into [[liquidation]]. The House of Lords held that Heller owed Hedley Byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for Hedley Byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company (although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in Heller's letter).&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|127–128}}

The application of ''Donoghue'' was discussed and, while all the judges agreed that it would be taking ''Donoghue'' too far to immediately apply it to ''Hedley Byrne'', [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] suggested that "what Lord Atkin did was to use his general conception [the neighbour principle] to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty" and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|128–129}}&lt;ref name="Hedley Byrne v Heller" /&gt;{{rp|524–525}}

===''Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co''===
[[File:BrownSeaIsland.jpg|thumb|alt=A modern photograph of an island with a yacht in the foreground|[[Brownsea Island]], where some [[young offenders]] were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate [[Brownsea Island Scout camp]]&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|129}}]]
''Home Office'' was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care.&lt;ref name="The Not so Golden Anniversary"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=JC |last2=Burns |first2=Peter |year=1983 |title=Donoghue v. Stevenson: The Not so Golden Anniversary |journal=[[Modern Law Review]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=147–163 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1983.tb02511.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150}} In ''Home Office'', the [[Home Office]] had taken a group of boys from a [[borstal]] to [[Brownsea Island]] in [[Poole Harbour]], where seven had escaped overnight and collided one [[yacht]] with another belonging to Dorset Yacht Company.&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co" /&gt;{{rp|1025}} The company sued the Home Office for negligence and a preliminary issue, whether the Home Office owed a duty of care to Dorset Yacht Company, was found in the company's favour by both the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and the Court of Appeal. The case was appealed to the House of Lords, who held by a majority that the Home Office did owe a duty of care.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|129–130}}

[[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], giving the leading judgment, rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim, instead acknowledging "a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that, when a new point emerges, one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles [from ''Donoghue''] apply to it".&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co" /&gt;{{rp|1026–1027}} ''Donoghue'', he argued, should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances.&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|132–133}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[''Donoghue''] may be regarded as a milestone, and the well-known passage in Lord Atkin's speech should I think be regarded as a statement of principle. It is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition. It will require qualification in new circumstances. But I think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion."&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co" /&gt;{{rp|1027}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the sole dissenting judgment, [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Viscount Dilhorne]] held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists.&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co" /&gt;{{rp|1043–1042}} Judges, he opined, "are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is. The absence of authority shows that no such duty [to Dorset Yacht Company] now exists. If there should be one, that is, in my view, a matter for the legislature and not for the courts".&lt;ref name="Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co" /&gt;{{rp|1045}} Chapman comments "that this conclusion appeared ... distinctly quaint, old-fashioned and even untenable in the light of [''Donoghue''] shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two House of Lords decisions".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|134}}

===''Caparo Industries plc v Dickman''===
In 1990, the House of Lords revised Lord Atkin's "neighbour" principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in ''[[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman]]''.&lt;ref name="Caparo"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Caparo Industries plc v Dickman |vol=1990 2 |reporter=AC |opinion=605 |court=[[UKHL]] |date=8 February 1990 |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-stage ''Caparo'' test for establishing a duty of care requires (i) foreseeability of damage, (ii) a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and (iii) that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other. In other jurisdictions, such as [[New Zealand]], there is now a two-part test for novel fact situations, where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters.

===Comparative law===
The judgment and reasoning of Lord Atkin in ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' is very similar to the judgment and reasoning applied by [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Cardozo CJ]] in the American case of ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339, 162 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.]] 99 (1928) four years earlier.  Although the similarity in approach has been noted by commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EKoPfh4UuPAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA71&amp;lpg=RA1-PA71&amp;dq=Palsgraf+v.+Long+Island+Railroad+donoghue+v+stevenson#v=onepage&amp;q=Palsgraf%20v.%20Long%20Island%20Railroad%20donoghue%20v%20stevenson&amp;f=false|title=International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law|author=Viktor Knapp|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1983|edition=|page=71|isbn=9789024727872}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision is '' Palsgraf'' was not cited in either argument or in the judgments in ''Donoghue'', although Lord Atkin did refer to an earlier decision of Cardozo J: ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'', [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916)].&lt;ref&gt;[1932] AC 562 at 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a metaphor===
Today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the case's name is used as a metaphor.  For example, ''[[Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd|Barclays Bank v W J Simms]]'' [1980] 1 QB 677 has been described as "the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' of [[English unjust enrichment law#Mistake|restitution for mistake]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virgo |first1=Graham |author-link1=Graham Virgo |year=1999 |title=The Principles of the Law of Restitution|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bpQC6F46urIC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=importance+of+barclays+bank+v+simms#v=onepage&amp;q=importance%20of%20barclays%20bank%20v%20simms&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-876377-2|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been stated that ''[[Slade's Case]]'' "could be said to

This included a [[academic conference|conference]] in Paisley Town Hall entitled "The Pilgrimage to Paisley: a Salute to ''Donoghue v Stevenson''".&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|173–174}} A [[memorial]] commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former Wellmeadow Café&lt;ref name="Mrs Donoghue's Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="May owes fame to slug" /&gt; and a bench was added in 1992; both were replaced in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New "snail bench" is in place |url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2012/04/20/new-snail-bench-is-in-place-87085-30796833/ |newspaper=[[Paisley Daily Express]] |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Justice Martin Taylor]] produced a [[documentary]] on the case: ''The Paisley Snail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Slug's trail to silver screen |author=Stephanie Todd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3143787.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=18 August 2003 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence of the snail===
[[File:Ślimak.JPG|thumb|alt=A photograph of a snail with a table and glass of juice in the background|The existence of the Paisley Snail has been doubted.]]
In a speech scheduled to be delivered in May 1942 (although delayed by the [[Second World War]]), [[Frank Douglas MacKinnon|Lord Justice MacKinnon]] jokingly suggested that it had been proven that Donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be quite candid, I detest that snail ... I think that [Lord Normand] did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the House of Lords, the case went back to Edinburgh to be tried on the facts. And at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all. That intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the [[Casual ejector|Casual Ejector]]."&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|170–171}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This allegation, suggests Chapman, established itself as a legal myth;&lt;ref name="The Snail and the Ginger Beer" /&gt;{{rp|172}} it was repeated by [[David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins|Lord Justice Jenkins]] in a 1954 Court of Appeal [[practice note]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Adler v Dickson |vol=1954 1 |reporter=WLR |opinion=1482 |court=[[EWCA]] |date=17 December 1954 |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1483}} However, both MacKinnon and Jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of Stevenson's death – the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashton-Cross |first=D.

{{tort law}}
'''Frolic and detour''' in the law of [[tort]]s occur when an [[employee]] (or [[law of agency|agent]]) makes a physical departure from the service of his employer (or principal).  A detour occurs when an employee or agent makes a minor departure from his employer's charge, and a frolic is a major departure when the employee is acting on his own and for his own benefit, rather than a minor sidetrack in the course of obeying an order from the employer. The employer will be relieved of [[vicarious liability]], which is usually assessed through the doctrine of ''[[respondeat superior]]'' for torts committed by the employee only if the employee has deemed to engage in a frolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barexamstrategy.com/sample2.html|title=SAMPLE MARYLAND Q &amp; A|author=|date=|website=barexamstrategy.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707212442/http://www.barexamstrategy.com/sample2.html|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the law of [[workers' compensation]], an employer is not liable for injuries incurred by an employee during a frolic, but the employer can still face liability for the results of a detour.

The term was coined in ''[[Joel v Morison]]''.

==Underlying rule of liability==
An employer is vicariously liable for the unintentional torts of his employees. Similarly, a principal is liable for unintentional torts committed by an agent. This rule extends to partners in a [[partnership]], who act as agents for one another, making each partner liable for unintentional torts committed by other partners while working for the benefit of the business. A frolic presents a situation that absolves employers, principals, and partners of this liability.  A detour, comparatively, still allows a judge or jury to assess liability upon the employer, as the agent’s/employee’s actions will not be considered so far beyond the scope of employment as to absolve the employer/principal from liability without a factual assessment.

==What constitutes a frolic vs. a detour==
To constitute a frolic or detour, the activity must be unrelated to the employer's business. However, in order for liability to be absolved, the employee must be engaged in a frolic, and not simply a detour (which may or may not result in absolution depending on additional circumstances). For example, when a delivery truck driver takes a longer route to the location he is supposed to deliver packages to because he wants to, say, see a new controversial billboard put up in town that has caused some public debate, he has merely taken a detour from his primary role as an employee/agent of the delivery company.  Were he to negligently hit a pedestrian, his employer could likely still face the prospect of vicarious liability.

Conversely, if the same delivery truck driver decided to skip work for a few hours to catch a baseball game and, en route to the game he struck a pedestrian, his employer/principal would likely avoid liability, as the driver/employee/agent’s actions have constituted a frolic, and his negligent actions occurred in furtherance of an act wholly separate from his employ, even though technically he is being paid during that time by his employer/principal.

Factors relevant to determining whether an individual was engaged in a frolic or detour in a specific circumstance include, but are not limited to the following:
#Time (Consider the amount time taken for the departure and also if the departure is within the time frame during which the employee is employed.)
#Place: was the place where the incident occurred within the scope of the employee's employment?
#Authorization: was the employee a manager and thus have more latitude in their operation, or was the employee occupying an entry-level position?
#Foreseeability of the employee's departure.
#Normalcy of the employee's departure.
#Purpose: was the departure personally motivated or for the benefit of the employer?
#Special obligation: was a special duty placed upon the employee such as a common carrier or innkeeper?
#Common sense.
#Scope of employment.

==Employer negligence compared==
Determining whether an employee or agent was on a frolic or a detour will not relieve the employer/principal of their own liability for negligent entrustment. Thus, where an employer negligently permits an employee who is known to be a reckless driver, or should have been known with a basic amount of investigation that is reasonable for most employers to perform, to use a company vehicle the employer will be liable to those injured when the employee causes a car accident, even if the employee was on a frolic at the time.

'''''God on Trial''''' is a 2008 British television play written by [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]], starring [[Antony Sher]], [[Rupert Graves]] and [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]. The play takes place in [[Auschwitz]] during [[World War II]]. The Jewish prisoners [[Lawsuits against God|put God on trial]] [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for abandoning the Jewish people. The question is whether God has broken his [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the [[Jew|Jewish people]] by allowing the Nazis to commit [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced and shown by the [[BBC]] on 3 September 2008.  Production was supported by [[PBS]], which screened the play as part of its [[Masterpiece (TV series)|''Masterpiece'']] anthology.

The play is based on an event described by [[Elie Wiesel]] in his book ''[[The Trial of God]]'', though Boyce describes this tale as "apocryphal".&lt;ref name="Boyce"/&gt; According to Boyce, producer [[Mark Redhead]] "had been trying to turn the story into a film for almost 20 years by the time he called me in 2005 to write the screenplay."&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{cite web|

&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wiesel later confirmed that the story was true, and that he was personally witness to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/wiesel-yes-we-really-did-put-god-trial|title=Wiesel: Yes, we really did put God on trial|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Score==
The music for the film was especially commissioned and composed by Nick Green and [[Tristin Norwell]].

==Reception==
Reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Sam Wollaston in ''[[The Guardian]]'' found it "powerful and thoughtful stuff, with some fine performances by some fine actors - Antony Sher, Rupert Graves, Dominic Cooper." &lt;ref name="guardianreview"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/sep/04/television.television Last night's TV] by Sam Wollaston, [[The Guardian]], 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarking that Boyce wrote the piece from a position of personal faith, James Walton in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' observed, "Yet, as each of the characters put forward a different view on the question of God and suffering, it was clear that he was willing to interrogate his beliefs with real ferocity."  This was a complex piece, and "as the fierceness of the intellectual and emotional grip tightened, it was impossible to imagine any halfway-thoughtful viewers, of whatever prior convictions, not having a disturbing sense of their own ideas coming under sustained and convincing attack."&lt;ref name="telegraphreview"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/09/04/nosplit/bvtv04last.xml Last night on television: Lost in Austen (ITV1)] by James Walton, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a long review for ''[[The Times]]'', Tim Teeman had great praise for the cast: "The performances were so strong it felt a privilege to watch the actors, among them Antony Sher, Rupert Graves, Stephen Dillane and Jack Shepherd." He also praises director Andy de Emmony's "brilliant, arresting sleight of hand... [mixing] the prisoners, naked and shorn, together with the present-day touring party in the gas chamber."&lt;ref name="timesreview"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4668035.ece God on Trial; Lost in Austen] by Tim Teeman, ''[[The Times]]'', 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''[[The Independent]]'', Thomas Sutcliffe remarked on Sher's role as the play's smouldering fuse: "Every now and then you saw Antony Sher, davening silently in a corner of the barracks. Like a loaded gun in a Chekhov play, you knew he was going to go off eventually and that it would be significant when he did, and indeed it was his explosive inventory of God's biblically attested crimes that finally swung the judges in favour of a guilty verdict."&lt;ref name="independentreview"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/last-nights-tv-lost-in-austen-itv1br-god-on-trial-bbc2-917939.html Last Night's TV: Lost In Austen, ITV1 God On Trial, BBC2], Thomas Sutcliffe, ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite fierce competition from the much-trailed, eagerly awaited debut episode of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s four-part-time travel fantasy series, ''[[Lost in Austen]]'', and an episode of the BBC's celebrity genealogy show, ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', featuring [[Esther Rantzen]], ''God on Trial'' attracted 700,000 viewers on BBC2, a 3% share of the audience, according to overnight returns.&lt;ref name="guardianovernights"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/04/tvratings.television?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media TV ratings: Family history show defeats Austen drama], [[The Guardian]], 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

When the show was shown in the United States on PBS, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said "They are big topics addressed with a striking lack of sentimentality, quite a feat considering the setting."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/tv/la-et-godontrial7-2008nov07,0,7506917.story Review: 'God on Trial' on PBS stations], 7 November 2008, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Mary McNamara&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' echoed the British reviewers in praising the "brilliant script" the "subtle wonders at every turn" in DeEmmony's direction, and remarked that "It seems trivial even to try to single out one superb performance from virtually every other superb performance."&lt;ref name="sfchronicle"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/07/DD3L13T58T.DTL TV review: Auschwitz prisoners put God on trial], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 8 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

''God on Trial'' aired on [[BBC2]] on Wednesday 3 September 2008&lt;ref name="Boyce"/&gt; and on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in the ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Contemporary]]'' strand on 9 November 2008.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/godontrial/index.html God on Trial], pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9386">The '''Hull note''', officially the '''Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement Between the United States and Japan''', was the final proposal delivered to the [[Empire of Japan]] by the [[United States]] before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japanese declaration of war]]. The note was delivered on November 26, 1941 and is named for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]]. It was the culmination of a series of [[events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor]].

==Background==
The United States objected to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the occupation of part of [[China]] by Japanese troops. In protest, the United States sent support to the [[History of the Republic of China|Nationalist government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].  In July 1941, Japanese military units occupied southern French Indochina, violating a gentlemen's agreement. Japanese bombers quickly moved into bases in Saigon and Cambodia, from which they could attack British Malaya. As a result, immediately after the Japanese military occupation, the US government imposed [[ABCD line|trade sanctions on Japan]], including the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States and an embargo of oil exports to Japan. [[Dean Acheson]], a senior State Department official, was the key decision maker. He shifted American policy away from export restrictions and toward "full-blooded financial warfare against Japan."

The expected result was the financial freeze, which Miller described as "the most devastating American action against Japan."&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Miller, ''Bankrupting the Enemy: The U.S. Financial Siege of Japan before Pearl Harbor'' (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2007) pp 108, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final attempts at peace==
On 5 November 1941, Emperor [[Hirohito]] approved, in Imperial Conference, the plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War'', 1998, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, his government made a last effort to arrive at a diplomatic solution of their differences with the United States. Ambassador [[Kichisaburō Nomura]] presented two proposals to the American government.

The first, Proposal A, was presented by him on November 6, 1941. It proposed making a final settlement of the Sino-Japanese War with a partial withdrawal of Japanese troops. United States military intelligence had deciphered some of Japan's diplomatic [[Code (cryptography)|codes]] so they knew that there was a second proposal in case it failed. The United States government stalled and then rejected it on November 14, 1941.

On November 20, 1941, Nomura presented Proposal B, which offered to withdraw Japanese forces from southern Indochina if the United States agreed to end aid to the Nationalist Chinese, freeze military deployments in Southeast Asia (except for Japan's reinforcement of northern Indochina), provide Japan with "a required quantity of oil," and assist Japan in acquiring materials from the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411120bpw.html "Draft Proposal Handed by the Japanese Ambassador (Nomura) To the Secretary of State," November 20, 1941]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States was about to make a counteroffer to this plan, which included a monthly supply of fuel for civilian use. However, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received a leak of Japan's war plan and news that Japanese [[troopship]]s were on their way to [[Indochina]]. He then decided that the Japanese were not being sincere in their negotiations and instructed Secretary Hull to drop the counterproposal.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Stimson diary, November 26, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 26, top American officials at the White House, State, Navy and War departments knew that Japan was moving invasion forces toward Thailand. They also knew that the Japanese foreign ministry had put an absolute deadline on negotiations of November 29 because "after that things are automatically going to happen." The Americans were convinced that war would start in a matter of days, probably with a surprise Japanese attack. No one knew where the strike would be.

The previous plan, to present Japan with a temporary ''[[modus vivendi]]'', was strongly opposed by China and Britain and dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dallek, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and American foreign policy, 1932-1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1979) pp 307-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
On November 26, 1941, Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note,&lt;ref name="Hull Note"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hull|first=Cordell|title=OUTLINE OF PROPOSED BASIS FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411126bpw.html|work=PEACE AND WAR, UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY 1931-1941|publisher=UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE WASHINGTON|accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as one of its conditions, demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from [[French Indochina]] and China. [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Tojo Hideki]] said to his cabinet that "this is an ultimatum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarnavigator.net/history/pearl_harbour.htm PEARL HARBOUR ATTACK - 7 December 1941, solarnavigator.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final decision made to attack==
The strike force that attacked Pearl Harbor had set sail the day before, on the morning of November 26, 1941, Japan time, which was November 25, Washington time. It could have been recalled along the way, but no further diplomatic progress was made.

At an Imperial Conference on 1 December, Emperor Hirohito approved attacks against the United States, the British Empire and the Dutch colonial empire. On 4 December Roosevelt was warned that the Japanese were preparing to attack Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8932197/Pearl-Harbour-memo-shows-US-warned-of-Japanese-attack.html&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7-8 the Japanese began attacks against [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Hawaii]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and the [[Philippines]].

==Interpretations==
In 1948, historian [[Charles A. Beard]] argued that the note was an ultimatum which meant unnecessary war. He suggested that at the time the note was delivered, Roosevelt and his advisors were actively planning for war and seeking to provoke the Japanese to attack first.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Beard, ''President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War 1941'' (Yale UP, 1948) ch 9, pp 574-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Japanese commentators say that the note was designed to draw Japan into war in such a way as to allow Japan to be presented as the aggressor nation. [[Toshio Tamogami]], who was the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] chief of staff, was forcibly retired by the Japanese government in 2008 for taking this position.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.apa.co.jp/book_report/images/2008jyusyou_saiyuusyu_english.pdf Tamogami's controversial essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513223146/http://www.apa.co.jp/book_report/images/2008jyusyou_saiyuusyu_english.pdf |date=2013-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benn Steil]], director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, while "no single individual can be said to have triggered" the Pearl Harbor attack, [[Harry Dexter White]] "was the author of the key ultimatum demands". Steil also maintains "the Japanese government made the decision to move forward with the Pearl Harbor strike after receiving the ultimatum."&lt;ref&gt;Steil, Benn (2013), The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, and the Making of a New World Order, Princeton University Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4850">{{Contract law}}
In [[contract law]], an '''illusory promise''' is one that courts will not enforce.  This is in contrast with a [[contract]], which is a promise that courts will enforce.  A promise may be illusory for a number of reasons.  In [[common law]] countries this usually results from failure or lack of [[consideration]] (see also [[consideration under English law]]).

Illusory promises are so named because they merely hold the illusion of contract.  For example, a promise of the form, "I will give you ten dollars if I feel like it," is purely illusory and will not be enforced as a contract.

It is a general principle of contract law that courts should err on the side of enforcing contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby J in ''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'' (1988) 15 NSWLR 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties entering into the arrangement presumably had the intention of forming an enforceable contract, and so courts generally attempt to follow this intention.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Portland Gasoline Co. v. Superior Marketing Co., 150 Tex. 533, 243 S.W.2d 823, 824, (1951''), overruled on other grounds by ''Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986 S.W.2d. 603 (Tex. 1998)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A promise conditioned upon an event within the promisor's control is not illusory if the promisor also "impliedly promises to make reasonable effort to bring the event about or to use good faith and honest judgment in determining whether or not it has in fact occurred."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corbin on Contracts, s 149, at 659.&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of finding potentially illusory contracts enforceable include:
* Implied-in-law "good faith" terms
* Implied-in-fact terms
* Bargaining for a chance

==Implied-in-law "good faith" terms==
Many contracts include "satisfaction clauses", in which a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn't subjectively satisfied with the promisee's performance.  Strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to.  However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied.  As another example, if a contract promises a promisee a certain percentage of the proceeds of a promisor's business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn't have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero.  However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]]'', 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires "best efforts" in such contracts.  This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty.

==Implied-in-fact terms==
Judges will often infer terms into the contract that the parties did not explicitly cite.  For instance, in the "satisfaction clause" case, judges might infer that the parties intended a "reasonableness test" - that the clause could be satisfied if a reasonable person would be satisfied by the promisee's performance, regardless of whether the promisor himself asserts he is satisfied.  (This interpretation is often used in cases in which a performance can be objectively evaluated, such as with the construction of a warehouse; the implied-in-law interpretation above is preferred where satisfaction is more subjective, as with the painting of a portrait.)

==Bargaining for a chance==
Many judges{{who|date=February 2011}} would consider the "bargaining for a percentage of the proceeds" example above an enforceable contract, even without an implied-in-fact or implied-in-law good faith term.  They would view the opportunity to enter into a business relationship to itself be acceptable consideration.  Put differently, the mere possibility that the promisor would do business is a valuable product of the bargain even if he does not do anything.  Of course, if the promisor entered into the relationship purely with the intent of fraudulently harming the promisee, he could be cited for fraud or bad faith principles that apply to all contracts.

==Changes to a "contract" without notification==
Some websites' "terms and conditions" may be deemed an illusory contract and unenforceable if the language can be changed at any time by the company without notifying users and giving them a chance to accept the new changes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harris v. Blockbuster Inc.]], No. 09-cv-217 (N.D. Tex. April 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Eric. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2012/10/10/how-zappos-user-agreement-failed-in-court-and-left-zappos-legally-naked/ How Zappos' User Agreement Failed In Court and Left Zappos Legally Naked], ''Forbes.com'', Oct. 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implied Authority of Contract''' is a [[legal]] term. In [[Contract|contract law]], it is the implied ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract on behalf of an organization, by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. When a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the [[logo]] or trademark of a business or organization; or if that person is functioning in an obviously authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization, that person carries an Implied Authority of Contract. Implied Authority is authority that is not express or written into the contract, but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of insurance for the principal. Implied authority is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract. 

For example, if you are at a restaurant and your waitress tells you that she can give you a free beverage if you pay for an entree, she has made a contract with you on behalf of the business by which she is employed. It is '''''implied''''' that she is given the '''''authority''''' to do so by the fact that she is the sole employee of the business who has been designated to complete a transaction with you. (Whether or not other employees ultimately get involved in your transaction is irrelevant, because it is expected that ideally she is the only person required to complete your business.) 

Continuing the scenario, suppose that a manager were to come to your table and inform you that your waitress has made a mistake; that the "free beverage w/ paid entree" offer has expired and that you will be expected to pay for your beverage. At this point the business is in direct violation of a legally enforceable contract made between you, the client, and their employee.

They may penalize the employee for the mistake, but Implied Authority of Contract places them under a legal obligation to honor the terms of the agreement.

The same principle applies to more complex or extreme legal circumstances.

A design professional’s implied authority gives the designer the means to act in ways that are incidental to the exercise of actual authority. It is authority that isn’t written down, but needs to be understood to make the construction process a success.  

Besides Implied Authority, look into [[Apparent authority|Apparent Authority]] and [[Express Authority]] as well.  In relation to [[company (law)|companies]], apparent authority is usually referred to as "[[ostensible authority]]".&lt;br&gt;
-These three are known as the Agency Relationship

'''Islam Hadhari''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] الإسلام الحضاري) or "Civilisational Islam" is a theory of government based on the principles of Islam as derived from the [[Qur'an]]. It was founded in [[Malaysia]] by its first [[Prime Ministers of Malaysia|prime minister]] [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] in 1957 (but under a different name) {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, and has been promoted by successive Malaysian governments, in particular, by ex-Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]].

==Overview==
Islam Hadhari should not be viewed as just the renewal of the old concept ''Islam Madani'' or ''Islam Hadhari'' as practised by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and his companions centuries ago. It should be viewed as the renewal of the old concept, in tandem to the modern era needs, on the relevancy of the Islamic maxims of the teaching of Islam to help solve the problems or issues of the modern Muslim ummah today (Ibrahim JCH, 2007). The concept or slogan 'Islam Hadhari' was officially launched in 2004 by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (2004-2009).

In spite of that, its main principles, such as, believing and obeying (taqwa) towards Allah, fair and just government system, independence of soul (of the people), acquisition of knowledge, balance and comprehensive economic development, quality standard of life, protection of women's rights and minority group, uphold morality and ethics, and so on – are in accordance with the teaching of the Quran and Sunnah.

Islam Hadhari is not a new religion, or a new school of thought, as propounded or reflected by some antagonism. Islam Hadhari is also not a new sect. Islam Hadhari is an effort to bring Muslims to the fundamentals contained in the Quran and Sunnah (Hadith), which are the core orientation of Islam Hadhari. Islam Hadhari is true if interpreted and understood clearly, and should not be diverted or misunderstood in any way (Ibrahim JCH, 2007; Mohd Azizuddin, 2010).

As a government responsible for protecting the sanctity of Islam and Muslims without slipping ensure that faith can face the challenges and realities of the current, open the door to ijtihad so that interpretation can be associated with the inherited form and pattern of development according to time and from place to place. It should be reviewed various approaches and methodologies for streamlined to be more balanced and comprehensive, covering the development of infrastructure and economic development, strengthen the human development through a comprehensive education program, is complemented by the development program to instill spiritual values and values Islam in life (Mohd Azizuddin, 2010).

==Defining Islam Hadhari==
The word Islam Hadhari consists of two words, Islam and Hadhari. Further contemplation of the concept of Islam Hadhari needs one to dichotomise the word Islam and Hadhari.

The word '''Islam''' (Ibrahim JCH, 2007):

* Literal meanings:
** Submission, surrender, obedience, acknowledgement, approval, and the acceptance of Allah. (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:208)
** [[:en:wikt:سلام|سلام]] (''[[Š-L-M#Arabic|salam]]''), the root word for the word Islam, means peace, tranquility. (Quran, Surah Al-Anfal 8:61)
* Technical meanings:
** A religion that stands for the complete submission and obedience to Allah to achieve real peace of body and mind. (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 136; Mawdudi, 1992)
** A divine religion (Quran, Surah Ash-Shaff 61:9), a religion of all Prophets. (Quran, Surah Al-Imran 3:84 &amp; Al-Baqarah 2:136)

The word '''Hadhari''' (Ibrahim JCH, 2007):

* The word 'hadhari' or 'madani' means township, city, urban. Also means modern, contemporary.
* The word 'hadhaari' or 'hadhariyah' means civilisation, that is civilisation which follows the teaching of Islam.

Thus, in essence, the word Islam Hadhari concisely refers to 'Islamic Civilisation' or 'Civilisation of Islam'. Hence, Islamic Civilisation demands its followers to be the best of example for mankind, to other Muslim, and also to non-Muslim. As said in the Qur'an:

‘You are the best of nation (people) evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah.’ (Quran, Surah Al-Imran 3:110)

Additionally, the Arabic word [[:en:wikt:حضارة|حضارة]] (''ḥaḍāra'', from which 'Hadhari' is derived) refers to both 'civilisation' and 'settled life' or 'sedentariness' (i.e. not being nomadic), so that the term Islam Hadhari implicitly contrasts itself with the Islam of nomads or bedouin.

==Principles of Islam Hadhari==
It consists of 10 fundamental principles.

* Faith and piety in [[Allah]]
* Just and trustworthy government
* Freedom and independence to the people
* Mastery of knowledge
* Balanced and comprehensive economic development
* Good quality of life for all
* Protection of the rights of minority groups and women
* Cultural and moral integrity
* Protection of the environment
* A strong defence policy

Islam Hadhari calls for Muslim to be progressive, modern and dynamic (in thinking and practice), which essentially encompasses the sphere of economy, politics, social, cultural, educational, defence, astronomy, and so on. Yet, Muslims are taught to be moderate in their behaviour and attitude, such that they should not indulge in excessive actions or extremism in their zeal to be the best of example for mankind - ‘Moderation in behaviour and attitude, yet dynamic and progressive in thinking and practice.’ (Ibrahim JCH, 2007). As said in the Qur'an:

'Thus, We have made of you an [[ummah]] justly balanced, that ye might be witnessed unto others ... ’ (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:143)

Islamic Hadhari is based on exactly the same principles as Islamic Shariah. The best practice to follow is the Quran and Sunnah, just like the Shariah stipulates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">'''LOVEINT''' is the practice of [[intelligence service]] employees making use of their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their [[love interest]] or [[spouse]]. The term was coined in resemblance to intelligence terminology such as [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]], [[COMINT]] or [[HUMINT]].

== National Security Agency ==
The term LOVEINT originated at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where approximately one such incident has been reported per year. In 2013, eight had been reported in the past decade, and they are the lion's share of unauthorized accesses reported by the NSA.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |title=NSA offers details on 'LOVEINT' (that's spying on lovers, exes) |author=Edward Moyer |work=CNET |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHk7ld6C?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most incidents are self-reported, for example during a [[polygraph]] test.

'''''Levy v. Louisiana''''', 391 U.S. 68 (1968), is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. This decision deals primarily with the civil rights of illegitimate children, specifically in regards to their ability to sue on a deceased parent's behalf. It held that the [[damages|right of recovery]] may not be denied merely because a person is the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] of the deceased, because such a law would violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

==Background==
Louise Levy was the mother of five children, all of them born out of wedlock. She cared for these children herself, maintaining with them a relationship much like any other "typical" household. After alleged [[malpractice]] by Levy's doctor at the [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital of Louisiana at New Orleans]], Louise Levy died. The [[appellant]], on behalf of Levy's children, sought damages for Levy's wrongful death as well as damages regarding an unsettled case that Levy had not lived to see settled.

The Louisiana District Court dismissed the suit. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, citing Louisiana statute defining a "child" for the purposes of damage recovery as a legitimate child. As the children were born outside of marriage, the courts deemed that they had no standing to sue on Levy's behalf. The Court of Appeals also defended its affirmation, claiming that the law was sound because it furthered the government interest of maintaining morals and general welfare by discouraging bearing children out of wedlock. The [[Supreme Court of Louisiana]] denied [[certiorari]], and the case was finally appealed to the US Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. Specifically, the appellant claimed that the Louisiana law violated the Fourteenth Amendment and was therefore invalid.

==Decision==
The 6-3 decision in favor of Levy's children was delivered on Monday, May 20, 1968. [[Supreme Court Associate Justice|Justice]] [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren|Warren]] and Associate Justices [[William J. Brennan|Brennan]], [[Byron R. White|White]], [[Abe Fortas|Fortas]], and [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]]. The Court stated that the children involved in this case were clearly "persons" under the Fourteenth Amendment, which entitled them to its full protection.

The Court noted that while states enjoy substantial powers to make classifications, states are not permitted to classify in a way that constitutes "invidious discrimination against a particular class." The objective nature of the "invidious discrimination" test was not clearly outlined, but the Court stated that the classifications states made had to be at least rational.

The Court continued to note the deference historically given to the legislature regarding its ability to draft law. However, when basic civil rights are involved, the Court said it has freely struck down "invidious discrimination," even laws with "history and tradition on [their] side." One precedent cited was the decision the Court made in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', a landmark case in American civil rights.

In the case at hand, the Court attacked the inappropriateness of the Louisiana statute and considered that the children's legitimacy had no bearing on their relationship to their mother. The statute was declared unconstitutional, and the decision of the lower courts was reversed.

Justice [[John M. Harlan II|Harlan]] authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]] and [[Potter Stewart|Stewart]].

This is a list of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], from its first [[parliamentary session|session]] in 1921 to suspension in 1972.

The [[short title]]s for these Acts were distinguished from those passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster parliament]] by the insertion of the bracketed words "Northern Ireland" between the word "Act" and the year.  Thus ''Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970'' was an Act passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland, whereas the ''Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998'' was passed at Westminster.

As with UK legislation, Northern Ireland's Acts of Parliament were traditionally cited using the regnal year(s) of the [[parliamentary session]] in which they became law.  The current convention is generally to only use the calendar year.  Thus the ''Civil Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 1925'' can be cited either as "15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5 c. 2 (N.I.)" or more commonly as "1925 c. 2 (N.I.)".  Note that by convention "(N.I.)" is also added after the chapter number; again, this is to avoid confusion with Westminster legislation.

This is a list of official [[minimum wage]] rates of the 193 [[United Nations member states]] and former members of the [[United Nations]], and also includes the following territories and states with limited recognition: [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and other independent countries. Some countries may have a very complicated minimum wage system; for example, India has more than 1202 minimum wage rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/main/salary/minimumwages |title=Minimum Wage in India 2013 |publisher=PayCheck.in |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Methodology ==
The minimum wages listed refer to a [[gross income|gross]] amount, that is before [[tax deduction|deduction of taxes]] and [[social security]] contributions, which vary from one country to another. Also excluded from calculations are regulated paid days off, including public holidays, sick pay, annual leave and [[social insurance]] contributions paid by the employer.

For the sake of comparison, an annual wage column is provided in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], a hypothetical unit of [[currency]] calculated based on the [[purchasing power parity]] of [[household final consumption expenditure]]. For calculating the annual wage, the lowest general minimum wage was used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12747">In a political sense, [[conspiracy]] refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. Typically, the final goal is to gain power through a revolutionary [[coup d'état]] or through [[assassination]]. A conspiracy can also be used for infiltration of the governing system.

A conspiracy is to be contrasted with a [[cabal]]. The two are similar but have quite different connotations; in contrast to a cabal, a conspiracy usually looks to overthrow a fixed power instead of usurping it from within.

A "[[conspiracy theory]]" is a belief that a conspiracy has actually been decisive in producing a political event which the theorists strongly disapprove of.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent, ''American Conspiracy Theories'' (2014) pp 31-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of wrongful convictions in the United States'''. This list includes people who have been legally exonerated, including people whose convictions have been overturned and have not been retried, as well as people who have not been formally exonerated but are widely considered to be factually innocent. This list includes only exonerees or cases that already have supporting Wikipedia articles. Crime descriptions marked with an '''asterisk''' (*) indicate that the events were later determined not to be criminal acts.

|colspan=5|Thomas Cornell Jr. was accused, tried, convicted and hanged for the alleged murder of his mother, Rebecca Briggs Cornell, in Portsmouth in 1673. He was convicted using [[circumstantial evidence]] as well as [[spectral evidence]], where witnesses recounted dreams involving ghosts pointing to his alleged guilt.&lt;ref&gt;This case and its history have been chronicled in the book ''Killed Strangely: The Death of Rebecca Cornell'' by Elaine Forman Crane.&lt;/ref&gt; American jurisprudence was later modernized to exclude the use of apparitions and dreams as evidence in trials.

Despite being generally known as the [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]], the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in several towns in the Province of Massachusetts Bay: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], and Salem Town.

|-
|colspan=5|In November 1805, the body of a young farmer, Marcus Lyon, was found on the open road near the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]]. Irish immigrants Dominic Daley and James Halligan were traveling in the area at the time, heading for [[New Haven, Connecticut]], when they were arrested for the murder on November 12, 1805.

|-
|colspan=5|Ed Johnson, a [[African Americans|black man]], was convicted for the [[rape]] of Nevada Taylor, a [[white Americans|white]] woman, and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. Taylor's initial description of the man was very vague. She told police she didn't get a good look at him and was unsure if the assailant was black or white. After the reward was increased to $375, another man in town told police he saw Johnson at the scene, and Taylor subsequently identified Johnson as her rapist. Johnson was beaten by sheriff Joseph Shipp to extract a confession, but maintained his innocence. On March 3, 1906, Johnson appealed the conviction, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated. Specifically, he alleged that all blacks had been excluded from the jury considering his case, and that he should have been granted a change of venue, and a continuance. He was granted a stay of execution and an appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

The decision&lt;!-- Which was what? --&gt; was communicated to Shipp, who moved most prisoners to other floors of the jail and sent home all but one deputy, presumably to assist the lynch mob. Johnson was pulled from his cell by a group of white men and hanged. Following the [[lynching]], Shipp publicly blamed the Supreme Court's interference with local courts for Johnson's death.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] charged Shipp, his chief jailer, and several members of the lynch mob with [[contempt of court]] on the basis that Sheriff Shipp, with full knowledge of the court's ruling, nonetheless chose willfully to ignore his duties to protect a prisoner in his care and allowed Johnson to be lynched. ''[[United States v. Shipp]]'' is the only criminal trial of the Supreme Court in its entire history. It is considered an important decision in that it affirmed the right of the Supreme Court to intervene in state criminal cases.

Shipp and several of his co-defendants were convicted and sentenced to terms from 2–3 months in federal prison.&lt;ref name=Lief&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lief|first1=Michael S.|title=The Devil's Advocates: Greatest Closing Arguments in Criminal Law|date=September 11, 2007|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0743246691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were convicted and executed via the [[electric chair]] in 1915 for the murder in 1913 of 75-year-old John Q. Lewis. The Griffin brothers were convicted based on the accusations of another black man, John "Monk" Stevenson, who was known to be a small-time thief. Stevenson, who was found in possession of the victim's pistol, was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for testifying against the brothers. Two other African Americans, Nelson Brice and John Crosby, were executed with the brothers for the same crime. Some in the community believed that Lewis may have been murdered because of his suspected consensual sexual relationship with 22-year-old Anna Davis. Davis and her husband were never tried, possibly for fear of a "mixed race relationship" scandal.

Over 100 people petitioned Gov. [[Richard Irvine Manning III|Richard Manning]] to commute the brothers' sentence.

|colspan=5|Brown was convicted of robbery in 1980, although the [[rental car]] used in the crime had been leased to a different Joyce Ann Brown, who lived in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The defendant had a strong alibi, as she was at work at the time of the crime. The conviction was based on eyewitness identification and on testimony of a cellmate that she had confessed. Following investigations by ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', and [[Centurion Ministries]], an appeal was filed.

Following conviction, Brandley's defense team discovered that several pieces of exculpatory evidence were not disclosed by the prosecution. Semen had been found at the scene, but was destroyed without being tested. A [[white people|Caucasian]] pubic hair was found on the body; Brandley is African American. Also missing were photographs taken of Brandley on the day of the crime showing that he was not wearing the belt that the prosecution claimed had been the murder weapon.

|colspan=5|In 1998, students in a journalism course taught by [[Northwestern University]] professor David Protess investigated the crime as part of a class assignment for the [[Medill School of Journalism#Medill Justice Project|Medill Innocence Project]]. The students gathered evidence exposing serious flaws in the prosecution. A witness [[recantation|recanted]], saying that Chicago police had "threatened, harassed and intimidated" him into accusing Porter. Another student noted that the shot had been fired by a left-handed shooter; Porter was right-handed. Inez Jackson, the estranged wife of Alstory Simon, came forward and said that she had been with Simon when he killed Hilliard in retaliation for "skimming money from drug deals". Four days later, Simon himself confessed to the crime on videotape. Protess and the students came forward with the information. Porter was released. Simon and his wife later recanted.

In October 2014, Illinois State's Attorney Anita Alvarez decided to release Simon, stating that David Protess, a former Northwestern University journalism professor whose students initially investigated the murders and private investigator Paul Ciolino had used coercive tactics that were "unacceptable by law enforcement standards". Among the charges that Alvarez made was that Ciolino used an actor to falsely implicate Simon.

Much of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' case depended on the information obtained in the interviews of the children who were allegedly sexually abused by the Amiraults. The interviews claimed that the children were raped with knives, sticks, forks, and magic wands; were assaulted by a clown (allegedly Gerald) in a "secret room" and a "magic room"; were forced to drink [[urine]]; were tied naked to a tree; and many other acts. The main criticism of this case was directed to reliability of the information obtained from the children. The bulk of the evidence was developed through videotaped interviews conducted by [[Susan J. Kelley]], a pediatric nurse. The children repeatedly told interviewers, including Kelley, that nothing happened to them. However, the questioning continued and eventually the children claimed all these things happened.

Woodall's defense team conducted its own tests on the evidence, which determined that Zain had used flawed blood-typing methods in tying the semen to Woodall. It further appeared that Zain had initially determined a piece of hair was unidentifiable pubic hair, but later changed his identification to hair from Woodall's beard.&lt;ref name=HuntingtonNews&gt;Rutherford, Tony.

At the request of the state police, [[Kanawha County]] Prosecutor William Forbes began a criminal investigation. Forbes was so disturbed by what he found that he asked the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] to appoint a special judge and a panel of lawyers and scientists to investigate the [[serology]] department.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; On November 4, 1993, Senior Circuit Court Judge James Holliday issued a report finding that Zain had engaged in a staggering litany of misconduct and outright fraud. According to the report, Zain had misstated evidence, falsified lab results and reported scientifically implausible results that may have resulted in as many as 134 people being wrongfully convicted. Holliday found that Zain's misconduct was so egregious that any testimony offered by Zain should be presumed as ''prima facie'' "invalid, unreliable, and inadmissible". It also found serious deficiencies in the serology division's quality-control procedures. The Supreme Court unanimously accepted Holliday's report on November 12, calling Zain's actions "egregious violations of the right of a defendant to a fair trial" and a "corruption of our legal system".&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;William J.

No physical evidence linked either Burrows or Frye to the crime, and the two men had alibis. After a lengthy interrogation, Frye agreed to a plea deal in exchange for testifying against Burrows. Following Burrows' conviction, Frye recanted his testimony to news reporter Peter Rooney, claiming that police had coerced him in exchange for a lesser sentence. Burrows' lawyers discovered a letter written by Potter asking a friend to lie and say that she had seen Burrows drive her to the crime scene. Confronted with the letter, Potter admitted that she had falsely accused the men in part because she mistakenly believed that Burrows had burglarized her trailer.

|colspan=5| In January, 1989, allegations were made that Bob Kelly had [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]] a child. A total of 90 children, after many [[Psychotherapy|therapy sessions]] (in some cases up to ten months' worth), also made allegations leading to accusations against dozens besides Kelly and charges against seven adults (Bob and Betsy Kelly, three workers at the day care, a worker at a local [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] center and the son of a judge). The charges ultimately involved [[rape]], [[sodomy]] and [[fellatio]], while other bizarre allegations were also made, including the murder of babies, torture and being thrown into a school of [[shark]]s.

During the trial, children were asked to testify about events that had occurred three years previously, with memories "refreshed" in therapy sessions, meetings with the prosecution and repeated discussions with their parents. While the alleged abuse was occurring, no parents noticed anything unusual about their children's behavior to indicate abuse or torture. The eight-month trial against Bob Kelly was the most expensive in North Carolina history, ending in conviction on 99 of 100 charges and twelve consecutive life sentences, though on May 2, 1995, all convictions were reversed in the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name = JITC&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeopardy in the courtroom | isbn = 1-55798-282-1 | pages = 9–11 | last = Ceci | first = SJ | authorlink = Stephen J.

DJ was soon diagnosed with a disease called [[methylmalonic acidemia]], a condition that presents with symptoms very similar to antifreeze poisoning. Upon reinvestigation, it was discovered that the lab that tested Ryan's blood mistook the [[propionic acid]] in the sample for ethylene glycol, since their peaks are very close on the gas chromatograph printout. A professor with [[St. Louis University]] saw the case featured on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and did an experiment where he sent blood samples containing propionic acid to a group of commercial labs. Almost half identified the sample as containing ethylene glycol. Stallings was exonerated in 1991.

|colspan=5|Willingham was convicted and executed for the death of his three children who died in a house fire. The prosecution charged that the fire was caused by [[arson]]. He has not been posthumously exonerated, but the case has gained widespread attention as a possible case of wrongful execution. A number of arson experts have decried the results of the original investigation as faulty. In June 2009, five years after Willingham's execution, the State of Texas ordered a re-examination of the case. Dr. Craig Beyler found "a finding of arson could not be sustained".

|-
|colspan=5|Rivera was wrongfully convicted three times for the murder of Staker, who was babysitting at a neighbor's house when she was raped and murdered by an intruder. Swabs were taken of a semen sample, but DNA testing was not performed at the time. Rivera was convicted on the basis of a confession that he claims was given under duress and which contained many factual inconsistencies. He was convicted twice before DNA testing was performed on the swabs taken from the crime scene. DNA testing excluded Rivera from being the source of the semen. Prosecutors decided to try him again despite the results of the DNA test, arguing that the semen sample was from consensual sex prior to the murder. He was convicted a third time.

His case was overturned a third and final time with the appellate court heavily criticizing prosecutors for arguing that Holly was sexually active without evidence and for putting so much weight on a confession obtained while Rivera, who suffered from mental illness, was in an "acute [[psychotic]] state" and which contained so many inaccuracies.

Following his exoneration, his defense team sought to do further testing on shoes that the state had once sought to enter into evidence. Holly's blood was found on shoes worn by Juan. The evidence had been dropped once it was discovered that the shoes were not for sale anywhere in the US until after the murder. Genetic testing performed in 2014 found not only Holly's blood, but genetic material that matches the semen found at the crime scene. His defense team argued that the reasonable interpretation is that in an effort to plant blood on Juan's shoes, the state also planted DNA from Holly's real killer. Following this revelation, the state agreed to settle with Rivera, giving him a $20 million USD settlement, the largest wrongful conviction settlement in US history.

The source of the DNA has never been identified, but it has been linked to evidence found at another murder scene. The man convicted of that murder insists this is proof that he himself has been wrongfully convicted.

|colspan=5|The key evidence against Camm was testimony regarding blood spatter patterns on his tee shirt. It was later discovered that one of the key prosecution witnesses, a blood spatter analyst whose findings had triggered the arrest, had falsified his credentials. He had testified at trial that he was a college professor in the process of getting his PhD. It was later uncovered that he had no affiliation to the university, had no training in blood spatter or crime scene analysis, and had never worked a single case prior to the Camm family murders. In 2013, he testified for the defense, explaining that he worked as an office assistant for a crime scene analyst and had been sent to the crime scene to take photos when he began voicing his opinions on the evidence. He claims the prosecutor, Stan Faith, fabricated the credentials for the trial.

A new suspect emerged when the defense compelled the prosecution to run DNA evidence found on a sweatshirt on the floor of the crime scene through [[CODIS]] a second time. It was discovered that the DNA was never run through CODIS despite the fact that Faith had assured Camm's defense team that it had been run and it returned no matches. The sweatshirt contained the DNA, prison nickname, and department of corrections number of Charles Boney, a convicted felon with a history of stalking and attacking women. He was on parole at the time for the attempted kidnapping of several college students from their apartment. Investigators had looked for Camm's DNA on the sweatshirt, but failed to investigate any other leads. A DNA analyst who worked on the case filed a complaint alleging that the prosecutor attempted to get her to testify that the foreign DNA sample was Camm's DNA. A fingerprint analyst who found Boney's prints testified to a similar interaction. The prosecutor was later discovered to be Boney's defense attorney as well as a personal family friend, and they admitted discussing the case prior to Boney becoming a suspect.

|colspan=5|In May 2001, Lobato, then 18, was staying at a residential motel in Las Vegas when she was allegedly attacked by a black man who "smelled like alcohol and dirty diapers." She was able to escape after she pulled out a knife and slashed the man's groin. Lobato was addicted to [[meth]] and had not slept for three days at the time of the attack, so she did not report the event to police, but she did tell friends. One of the friends who heard Lobato's story told a teacher who notified police. In July, a homeless man named Duran Bailey was found murdered on the other side of town. His penis had been severed. Although Lobato told friends about her attack prior to Bailey's murder and she had an alibi for the time of the murder, police suspected Lobato to be his killer. Police confronted her about the attack and she tearfully told them details. At the end of the interview, she was informed that she killed the man who attacked her and she was charged with murder. This "confession" would serve as key evidence against her. It wasn't until after her arrest that she discovered that the man whose murder she was charged with wasn't the man who attacked her. In 2017, her defense team convinced the appellate court that had the jury heard the strong entomological evidence pinpointing of Bailey's time of death coupled with her alibi witnesses placing her in [[Panaca, Nevada]], they would have acquitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4791">'''Miroslav Šašek''' (November 16, 1916, [[Prague]] – May 1980, [[Wettingen]], [[Switzerland]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] emigre author and illustrator, best known for a series of books for children titled ''[[This Is... (book series)|This Is...,]]'' which he signed M. Sasek.&lt;ref&gt;Zprávy Společnosti pro vědu a umění při Čs. národní radě  1980 "Počátkem června t.r. zemřel ve Švýcarsku vynikající český malíř, grafik a ilustrátor Miroslav Šašek. Narodil se r. 1916 v Praze, odkud po studiích odešel r. 1947 do Francie, kde studoval na umělecké akademii v Paříži. Několik let pracoval v rozhlasové stanici Svobodná Evropa, ale pak se věnoval plně své umělecké tvorbě. Žil střídavě v -Paříži a v Mnichově. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Šašek's family background was in [[Miller|milling]]:  the family operated the ''"Lucký mlýn"'' mill at [[Chodovlice]] in northwest Bohemia.   His father worked as an insurance agent to the south of [[Prague]] in [[Sedlčany]], but died in 1926, after which he moved with his mother to Prague.  Trained as an architect, Miroslav Šašek had recently embarked on a career in children's literature when the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]] prompted him to emigrate to [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], where he worked for [[Radio Free Europe]] from 1951 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Doris De Montreville, Donna Hill ''Third book of junior authors'' 1972 -- Page 250 "Biographical sketch of Miroslav Sasek: MIROSLAV SASEK was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and educated there, specializing in art and architecture. When the Communists came into power in 1946, he left the country and went to Paris where he continued his studies at L'Ecole des Beaux Arts. Much as he loved Paris and felt at home there, he did not become a French citizen but has preferred to remain stateless."&lt;/ref&gt; ''This Is Paris'' appeared in 1959, starting what ultimately grew into a series of eighteen books. Šašek's ''This Is London'' received the ''[[New York Times]]'' Choice of Best Illustrated Children's Book of the Year in 1959, as did ''This Is New York'' in 1960. ''This Is New York'' also received the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boy's Club of America]] Junior Books Award in 1961, while ''This Is the United Nations'' appeared on the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] Honor List in 1979. Šašek was living in [[Paris]] at the time of his death, which occurred on a trip to [[Switzerland]].

'''Pharmaceutical innovations''' are currently guided by a patent system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Review of the Innovation Patent System|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-9804542-7-7|location = |pages = 2|url = http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_-_Review_of_the_Innovation_Patent_System.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150227150807/http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_-_Review_of_the_Innovation_Patent_System.pdf|archivedate = 2015-02-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the patent system protects the innovator of medicines for a period of time. The patent system does not currently stimulate innovation or pricing that provides access to medicine for those who need it the most, It  provides for  profitable innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Medicine for the 99 percent|url = http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_pogge_medicine_for_the_99_percent|accessdate = 2015-04-15|first = Thomas|last = Pogge}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 about $140 Billion is spent on research and development of pharmaceuticals which produces 25-35 new drugs. Technology, which is transforming science, medicine, and research tools has increased the speed at which we can analyze data but we currently still must test the products which is a lengthy process.&lt;ref name="Milet"&gt;{{Cite web|title = MedidataVoice: The Next Wave Of Pharmaceutical Innovation: An Interview With Bernard Munos|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/medidata/2014/10/06/the-next-wave-of-pharmaceutical-innovation-an-interview-with-bernard-munos/|accessdate = 2015-04-15|first = Sylvain|last = Milet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the performance of medical care may be due to variation in the introduction and circulation of pharmaceutical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The timing of introduction of pharmaceutical innovations in seven European countries - Westerling - 2014 - Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice - Wiley Online Library|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jep.12122|journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice|access-date = 2015-04-15|doi=10.1111/jep.12122|volume=20|pages=301–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical innovation may not apply the same definition of "initiative" as other industries because while a product might use a new molecule or formula, that by itself holds very little value. For people that need the product the health benefits that were not previously achievable may be a deciding factor as to whether or not it is initiative. While a pharmaceutical company may view a product that fills a niche as innovative if it can produce a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Steven|last2=Lopert|first2=Ruth|last3=Greyson|first3=Devon|title=Toward a definition of pharmaceutical innovation|journal=Open Med|date=2008|pmc=3091590|pmid=21602949|volume=2|pages=e4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decline in research and development has been coined as [[Eroom's Law]].&lt;ref name=forbespp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feyman|first1=Yevgeniy|title=Is Pharmaceutical Productivity In Decline?

== Current Model ==
The FDA has implemented the Breakthrough Therapy Designation which should help bring new needed products to the market faster.&lt;ref name="Milet"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;One of the key concerns in the current patent system is that an innovation patent is overly generous given that it has a very low inventiveness threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review of the Innovation Patent System|url = http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_-_Review_of_the_Innovation_Patent_System.pdf|website = www.acip.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-04-15|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150227150807/http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_-_Review_of_the_Innovation_Patent_System.pdf|archivedate = 2015-02-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Medicines Patent Pool]]''' (MPP), is a United Nations-backed organisation founded in July 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitaid.eu/images/EB11/05%20_eb11%20res.5%20implementation%20of%20patent%20pool.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The MPP aims to improve access to appropriate, affordable HIV medicines and technologies for people living with HIV in developing countries. Working in partnership with a range of stakeholders, the MPP opens the door to generic low-cost production of key HIV therapies as well as fixed-dose combinations and paediatric formulations by creating a pool of relevant patents for sub-licensing and product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=RUNYOWA|first1=TAVENGWA|title=Medicines Patent Pool Aims To Increase Access To HIV Drugs In Developing Countries|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2011/03/10/medicines-patent-pool-aims-to-increase-access-to-hiv-drugs-in-developing-countries/|website=IP Watch|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement ===
Kristopher J. Hult has proposed a new measurement based on novel and incremental innovation.  The model predicts a decline of 40% for the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hult|first1=Kristopher|title=Kristopher J. Hult: Research|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~khult/research.html|website=University of Chicago - Department of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One current way to measure is the [[Internal rate of return]], which is used to measure and compare the profitability of investments. [[Reuters]] used the method to measure 2012 and found that the rate fell from 7.7% to 7.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the return from pharmaceutical innovation 2012|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/en/articles/2013/measuring-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2012.html|website=Reuters|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers ===
Regulatory uncertainty is one area that stifles innovation. The approval processes are becoming increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = measuring the return from pharmaceutical innovation 2014|url = http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/measuring-the-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2014.pdf|website = www2.deloitte.com|accessdate = 2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed Models ==

The '''[[Health Impact Fund]]''' ('''HIF''') is a proposed pay-for-performance mechanism that would provide a market-based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally. It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global [[disease burden|burden of disease]]. The HIF is the creation of a team of researchers led by the [[Yale]] philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] and the [[University of Calgary]] economist Aidan Hollis, and is promoted by the non-profit organization Incentives for Global Health (IGH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollis|first1=A|last2=Grootendorst|first2=P|last3=Levine|first3=DK|last4=Pogge|first4=T|last5=Edwards|first5=AM|title=New approaches to rewarding pharmaceutical innovation.|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=2011|doi=10.1503/cmaj.100375|pmid=21149519|pmc=3071389|volume=183|pages=681–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27184">[[File:Diekirch-Militärmuseum 040.jpg|thumb|[[Military medicine|Medical personnel]] during an [[armed conflict]] carry out humanitarian work and are "protected persons" under [[international humanitarian law]]. Whether military or civilian, they are considered [[non-combatants]] and may not be attacked and not be taken as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] by parties to a conflict. They use a [[protective sign]] such as the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|red cross, red crescent or red crystal]]&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Articles 38, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Geneva Convention, Articles 41, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 38. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol II, Article 12. &lt;/ref&gt;. ]]

'''Protected persons''' is a legal term under [[international humanitarian law]] and refers to persons who are under specific protection of the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], their 1977 Additional Protocols, and [[customary international humanitarian law]] during an [[armed conflict]]. 

The legal definition of different categories of protected persons in armed conflicts is found in each 1949 Geneva Conventions and also in 1977 Additional Protocols&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Geneva Convention, Article 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;. The extent of protection and obligations of [[belligerent]] states and parties depends on the type of the [[armed conflict]] (international or not international) as well as on the category of protected persons in terms of their age (adult/child), sex (man/woman), participation in the armed conflict ([[combatant]]/[[prisoner of war]]/civil person) and personal situation (e.g. shipwrecked, sick, wounded, etc.)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Minimum rights and fundamental guarantees are granted by the 1977 [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and II to the persons not covered by the 1949 Geneva Conventions, independently of the character of the conflict (international or national)&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 75.&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, the [[Protocol II|Additional Protocol II]] extended the protection of existing protected persons in non-international armed conflicts (persons deprived of liberty, wounded and sick, medical and religious personnel, civilian population).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/download/file/1400/additional-protocols-geneva-conventions-1949-icrc-eng.pdf|title=Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
In 1862 [[Henry Dunant|Henri Dunant]] published a book, ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'', describing his experience of the horrors of war during the [[Battle of Solferino]]. It increased the desire to improve the conditions of the wounded in armies in the field. Following the diplomatic conference inspired by his ideas and attended by the governments of Europe and several American states, the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention have been concluded in 1864 by twelve European countries.

The article 6 of this Convention already stipulated:  “''Wounded or sick combatants, to whatever nation they may belong, shall be collected and cared for.”''

This Convention have been replaced by the Geneva Conventions of 1906, 1929 and 1949, based on new elements occurred during the subsequent wars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm|title=The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols|last=ICRC|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Applicable texts ==
In the area of international humanitarian law, four 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Additional Protocols and [[customary international humanitarian law]] are the source of the rights and protections for various categories of persons in the context of international armed conflicts, and also non international armed conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guide-humanitarian-law.org/content/article/3/protected-persons/|title=Protected persons|last=|first=|date=|website=The Practical Guide to Humanitarian Law.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These texts are focused on protection of victims of armed conflicts and they are based on one general principle: obligation of human treatment of protected persons, without discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, nationality, language, or religion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] are also in force, fully applicable and constitute a part of customary international law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even before the Geneva Conventions, they already contained a number of important provisions regarding the protection of prisoners of war (forbidden actions) and civil persons (e.g. during the occupation)&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention 1907, Articles 22-28, 42-56. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing and Lichtenhahn|year=2003|isbn=2-8027-1836-3|location=Basel|pages=26-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, [[Human Rights Law|human rights law]] also applies to armed conflicts and protects all individuals within the jurisdiction of the state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing and Lichtenhahn|year=2003|isbn=|location=Basel|pages=228-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Protected persons associated with the armed forces ==
Definition of military victim is given by the Article 13 of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention 1949&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 13&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Article 4 of the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention 1949 for the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea&lt;ref&gt;Second Geneva Convention II, Article 13&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several sub-categories of military victims:

* wounded and sick in armed forces in the field;
* wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea; the status of shipwrecked has a determined duration and can change due to the events in the sea to combatant, interned, prisoner of war (for militaries); to protected person under the Article 4 of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention (for civilians)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino édieur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;; 
* medical and religious personnel attached to armed forces&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*war correspondents &lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 13 (4). &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 4. &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Legal effects ===
There are two types of obligations incumbent to the signatory nations under Article 12 of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention:

* respect, protect and rescue wounded and sick militaries&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international hulanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention 1949, Article 12&lt;/ref&gt;;
* provide treatment and care without any discrimination between them. 

In addition to that, the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention establishes a unitary protection for all sick, wounded and shipwrecked independently of their military or civil status. In return, sick and wounded persons shall refrain from any hostile behaviour to benefit from this protection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; . 

In case of necessity, belligerent powers can appeal to the charity of the civilian population. That being said, the civilian population shall only “respect these wounded and sick, and in particular abstain from offering them violence”, but at the same time can not be prosecuted and convicted “for having nursed wounded or sick”&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 18&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Prisoners of war ==
Legal definition of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] is given in the Article 4 of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention and apply to the following persons, who "have fallen into the power of the enemy": 

* the regular combatants of the adversary (members of the armed forces, ''[[levée en masse]]'', militias, members of volunteer corps, [[resistance movements]]);
* certain civilians, like civilian members of military aircraft crews; war correspondents; suppliers; members of labour units or services in charge of the welfare of the armed forces;
* members of the medical personnel chaplains who assist the prisoners of war, shall not be considered as prisoners of war. However, they have right to the protection no less favourable than the protection accorded to the prisoners of war&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote1sym|.]]

Several type of persons has right to the treatment equal to the prisoners of war, without holding this status (parliamentarians, children-combatants)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 5. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In case of doubt, the concerned person has a right to the presumption of status of prisoner of war&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;, until the exact status is established by the competent court.

=== Persons with special status ===
Four categories of persons need an additional attention:

* '''deserter''' in the hands of the adversary party shall at least be considered as a prisoner of war, but can also obtain another not less favourable status&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;;
* '''betrayer''' in the hands of his Origin State does not have right to the status of the prisoner of war according to the international dominant practice&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;;
* '''spy''' could be considered as a prisoner of war (combatant in uniform or resident of occupied territory) or not (civil persons or combatant without uniform)&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 46. &lt;/ref&gt;;
* '''mercenary''' has no right to the status of the prisoner of war or combatant, under condition to respect a number of cumulative criteria&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 47. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=164-165}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Legal effects ===
The 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention describes in a detailed manner the protection granted to the prisoner of war and obligations incumbent upon the belligerents:

* ''Humane treatment'' - prisoners of war shall be protected against acts of violence, intimidation, insults and public curiosity. They should be housed and receive a sufficient nourishment. Mutilations, medical and scientific experiments, removal of organs for transportation are forbidden&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 12&lt;/ref&gt;. They have rights to quarters, food, clothing, hygiene, medical attention&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 25-31&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote2sym|,]] property&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 58-68&lt;/ref&gt;, representation&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 79-81&lt;/ref&gt; and their badges of rank and nationality .
* ''Equal treatment'' – prisoners of war shall be treated without any discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, religion, opinions and similar criteria &lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 16&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''Security''&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 19&lt;/ref&gt; – the prisoners of war shall be evacuated from combat and danger zone. Their quarters shall bear the and by indications clearly visible from the air.
* ''Labour'' – prisoners of war could be utilized by the Detaining power for work respecting their age, sex, rank, physical aptitude&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 49-57&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote7sym|.]] 
* ''Proceedings'' – the Detaining power can prosecute the prisoner of war according to it own laws, regulations and orders in force. During the criminal trial, the prisoner could refuse to cooperate with the Court. Judicial proceedings against the prisoners of war shall be carried in accordance with the fair trial canons. Disciplinary measures shall be adopted rather than judicial wherever it is possible. Even after the conviction, the prisoner keeps his status of the prisoner of war. The [[death penalty]] is acceptable by the customary law and the Conventions&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 82-108&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''Repatriation'' – seriously wounded or sick prisoners of war shall be send back to their country regardless of number or rank. The rest of prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated after the cessation of active hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilian persons ==
The term of protected civilian persons is described in the Article 4 of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;. It does not protect all civilian persons in general, but only those who are in "in the hands of" the adverse party during the armed conflict, “persons who at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of persons a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals”. In case of doubts, the persons is presumed to be civilian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Kolb|first=Robert|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It seems that the nationals of the countries who are not part of the 1949 Geneva Conventions are not protected by these texts, but given that the ratification is now universal and the role of the customary international humanitarian law, this limitation is no longer of practical reference. Neutral persons are not protected as long as “their State of nationality maintains normal diplomatic representation with the State in which they find themselves”. 

Another definition is given by the Article 50 of the Additional Protocol I, but in a negative way – everybody, who does not belong to the armed forces or prisoners of war belongs to civilian population&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, 1977, Article 50&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, persons that were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, have minimum protection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, the protection of civilians was extended to the cases of war of national liberation&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 1. &lt;/ref&gt;.  

The legal effect of the status depends on the category of civilian persons and their location (on the territory of adversary Party or on the occupied territory)&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention 1949&lt;/ref&gt;.

The civilians can loose the protection against the attacks, if they participate in the hostilities against the enemy &lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol II, Article 13. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geenva Convention, Article 5. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== General protection of civilian persons ===
According to the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Geneva Convention, the rights of protected civilian persons are absolute and inalienable. As a consequence,

* parties of armed conflicts can not conclude special agreement that will "adversely affect the situation of protected persons"&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 7&lt;/ref&gt;;
* protected persons can not renounce to their rights&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote2sym|;]]
* protected persons of occupied or annexed territories could not be deprived from the rights established in the Geneva Convention&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ius in Bello|last=Robert|first=Kolb|publisher=Helbing &amp; Lichtenhann|year=2003|isbn=3-7190-2234-X|location=Basel|pages=180-181}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote4sym|.]]

The Additional Protocol I prohibits indiscriminate attacks or reprisals against the civilian persons, their objects, and objects necessary to their survival&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[#sdendnote5sym|.]] 

There is a number of basic rights covering the civilian persons:

* ''Humane treatment'' – protected persons are “entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honor, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs”.They shall be protected against acts of violence, intimidation, insults and public curiosity&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote6sym|.]] 
* ''Equal treatment'' – protection should be provided without any discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, religion, opinions. Health, rank, sex and age distinction are accepted.
* ''Security''  – protected persons could not be used as a human shield. Corporal punishments, torture, murders, collective penalties and experiments are forbidden. Taking of hostages and pillage are prohibited&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 29&lt;/ref&gt;.

In case of non international armed conflict, Article 3 of [[Third Geneva Convention]] grants basic rights to civilian persons. 

=== Civilian persons on the belligerent territory ===
In case the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable, protected persons can leave the territory, unless it will be contrary to the interests of the belligerent state (i.e. men of fighting age)&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 35&lt;/ref&gt;.

Protected person shall have the possibility to appeal against the refusal of permission to leave the territory. The proceedings shall be carried in accordance with the fair trial canons&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Articles 35 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several limitations could be applied to the nationals of adversary party (assigned residence, internment, registration etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Articles 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;, but they should be able to receive medical assistance, practice their religion, move from danger or military zone and find paid employment.

=== Civilian persons on occupied territories ===
Occupying powers shall respect at least the following rights:

* deportations of protected persons from occupied territory is forbidden, except in case of evacuation for security reasons or for imperative military reasons; if such evacuations arise, they shall be temporary; occupying power shall never transfer its own civilian population to the occupied territory.
* in case of evacuation and transfer the Occupying power shall ensure the human treatment and security of protected persons;
* forced labour is forbidden;
* destruction of real and personal property is forbidden;
* occupying power shall ensure and maintain food and medical supplies, as well as the medical care to the population of occupied territories&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 47-62&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote1sym|.]]

== Medical, religious and humanitarian personnel ==
Medical personnel benefits from the protection of all four Geneva Conventions&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 24 and 25. Second Geneva Convention, Articles 36-37. Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 20. Additional Protocol I, Article 15. Additional Protocol II, Article 9&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, this category of protected persons implement the protection of protected persons established by international humanitarian law, especially wounded and sick combatants.  They should not be attacked, but in contrary respected, kept out of danger and be free to pursue their medical or spiritual duties&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 28. Second Geneva Convention, Article 37. Third Geneva Convention, Article 33. Additional Protocol I, Article 16. Additional Protocol II, Article 9. &lt;/ref&gt;, unless they are used to commit the acts harmful to the enemy&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 13. &lt;/ref&gt;. This protection covers permanent, auxiliary medical personnel, chaplains, staff of National [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross Societies]] and other Voluntary Aid Societies, neutral state society if agreed with Parties to the conflict&lt;ref&gt;First Geneva Convention, Article 26. &lt;/ref&gt;. Hospitals, medical transport, ships, units, and establishments are also protected and shall bear the distinctive emblems and marks&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

Retained permanent personnel is not considered as a prisoners of war, but should benefit from at least the same protection&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 33&lt;/ref&gt;. Auxiliary personnel shall be prisoners of war&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention , Article 32. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Women  ==
The Geneva Conventions grants special protection to women in all circumstances. Wounded and sick women (members of the army, prisoners of war) shall be treated taking in consideration their sex &lt;ref&gt;First and Second Geneva Conventions, Article 12. Third Geneva Convention, Article 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote1sym|.]] During captivation, they should be housed in separated dormitories from men, have separate facilities&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 25, 29. Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 76.&lt;/ref&gt;, be under supervision of the women&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Articles 97, 108. Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 76.&lt;/ref&gt;. “Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Pregnant women, women in childbirth, women who are breast-feeding or who have small children less than 7 years old are considered as sick and wounded&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Derya|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Children ==
Several provisions of the Geneva Conventions grant a special protection to the children under fifteen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire|last=Deyra|first=Michel|publisher=Gualino éditeur|year=1998|isbn=2-84200-160-5|location=Paris|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Children are protected as victims of the armed conflicts. They can benefit from special hospital and safety zones in time of peace and the outbreak of hostilities, evacuation from besieged of encircled areas&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Articles 14 and 17&lt;/ref&gt;. Necessary measures shall be taken in order to ensure their maintenance, exercise of the religion, education, if possible, by the persons with the same nationality&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 24&lt;/ref&gt;. They shall benefit from the same preferential treatment as the nationals of the adversary part.

During the internment, they shall be housed separately from the adults, unless with their parents and family members&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 77&lt;/ref&gt;. Additional food shall be given taking in consideration their physiological needs&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention, Articles 23, 50, 89. Additional Protocol I, Article 78. Additional Protocol II, Article 4.3.  &lt;/ref&gt;.

Also, children are protected as children-combatants. The parties of the conflict shall avoid to use them in hostilities&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 77. Additional Protocol II, Article 4.  &lt;/ref&gt;. In case of their participation, children continue to benefit from the special protection&lt;ref&gt;Third Geneva Convention, Article 16. Additional Protocol I, Articles 45, 75, 77. Additional Protocol II, Article 4.  &lt;/ref&gt;. Death penalties shall not be executed for persons under 18 years old&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 77&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Protection during non-international armed conflicts ==
Increasing number of non-international armed conflicts have been noticed after the Second World War. Theses conflicts are characterised by two factors:

* the parties of the conflict could belong to the same jurisdiction; as a consequence, it is difficult to establish when he civilians are in the hands of the enemy; 
* at least one of the parties is composed from the non governmental armed forces&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Droit international humanitaire - Introduction détaillée|last=Melzer|first=Nils|publisher=CICR|year=2018|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=288-291}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a consequence, the main goal of the international humanitarian law is not the protection of civilians, but the protection of all non-participants of the conflict (independently of the nature of the detaining power)&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. 

Humane treatment is granted by the common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. It forbids: 

* ''"violence to life and person'' (i.e. murders and torture)'';'' 
* ''taking of hostages;''
* ''outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;''
* ''the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.''"

The Additional Protocol II completes the article 3 of the Geneva Conventions adds several forbidden actions and grants to protected persons the rights to "respect for their person, honour and convictions and religious practices". 

Children continue to benefit from special protection&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol II, Article 4(3).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Additional Protocol II also prohibits the forced movements of civilians &lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol, Article 17.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Relation between the end of the armed conflict and protection ==
It becomes more difficult to determine the end of the armed conflict in the contemporary world, and as a consequence, the application of international humanitarian law in general and to protected persons in particular&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Un droit dans la guerre?|last=Sassoli|first=Marco|publisher=CICR|year=2012|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[#sdendnote1sym|.]]  Wars in contemporary world rarely end with a total defeat or by real peace. However, under all circumstances, protected persons remain protected by the minimum guarantees and by international human rights law. 

== Sanctions ==
Penal sanctions are foreseen in the Geneva Conventions for persons who committed or ordered to commit grave breaches against protected persons. The grave breaches are qualified as a sub-type of [[War crime|war crimes]]&lt;ref&gt;Additional Protocol I, Article 85&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51122">[[Image:Roof-albedo.gif|thumb|300px|The [[albedo]] of several types of roofs]]

''Reflective surfaces'' are surfaces that can deliver high [[solar reflectance]] (the ability to reflect the visible, [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of the [[sun]], reducing heat transfer to the surface) and high [[thermal emittance]] (the ability to radiate absorbed, or non-reflected solar energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=California Energy Commission |title=Title 24, Part 6, of the California Code of Regulations: California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings|date=2008|publisher=California Energy Commission|location=Sacramento, CA|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-400-2008-001/CEC-400-2008-001-CMF.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Reflective surfaces''' are a form of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].

The most well-known type of reflective surface is the ''cool roof''.
While cool roofs are mostly associated with white roofs, they come in a variety of colors and materials and are available for both commercial and residential buildings. Today's "cool roof" pigments allow metal roofing products to be [[EnergyStar]] rated in dark colors, even black.

''Solar reflective cars'' or cool cars reflect more sunlight than dark cars, reducing the amount of heat that is transmitted into the car’s interior. Therefore, it helps decreasing the need for air conditioning, fuel consumption, and emissions of greenhouse gases and urban air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cool Cars|journal=Applied Energy|volume=88|issue=12|pages=4343–4357|url=http://heatisland.lbl.gov/projects/projects-cool-cars|accessdate=1 December 2011|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.05.006|year=2011|last1=Levinson|first1=Ronnen|last2=Pan|first2=Heng|last3=Ban-Weiss|first3=George|last4=Rosado|first4=Pablo|last5=Paolini|first5=Riccardo|last6=Akbari|first6=Hashem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cool color parking lots are parking lots made with a reflective layer of paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2012/09/13/parking-lot-science/|title=Parking Lot Science: Is Black Best?|author=|date=2012-09-13|work=News Center|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cool pavement|Cool pavements]] which are designed to reflect solar radiation may use modified mixes, reflective coatings, permeable pavements, and vegetated pavements.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Kendra (September 1, 2011).

==Benefits of cool roofs==
Cool roofs, in hotter climates, can offer both immediate and long-term benefits including:
* Savings of up to 15% the annual air-conditioning energy use of a single-story building&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy (2010). [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/cool_roof_fact_sheet.pdf Cool roof fact sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help in mitigating the [[urban heat island]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Bryan|title=Guidelines for Selecting Cool Roofs|date=2011|publisher=US. Department of Energy|url=http://heatisland.lbl.gov/sites/heatisland.lbl.gov/files/coolroofguide_0.pdf|author2=Kurt Roth }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Reduced air pollution and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, as well as a significant offsetting of the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akbari|first=Hashem |author2=Surabi Menon |author3=Arthur Rosenfeld|title=Global cooling: increasing world-wide urban albedos to offset CO2|journal=Climatic Change|date=June 2009|volume=94|issue=3|pages=275–286|doi=10.1007/s10584-008-9515-9|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc933566/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cool roofs achieve cooling energy savings in hot summers but can increase heating energy load during cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency|title=Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies|date=2011|url=http://epa.gov/heatislands/resources/pdf/CoolRoofsCompendium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the net energy saving of cool roofs varies depending on climate. However, a 2010 energy efficiency study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Levinson |first=R |author2=Hashem Akbari |title= Potential benefits of cool roofs on commercial buildings: conserving energy, saving money, and reducing emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants|journal= Energy Efficiency |date=2010|issue=3|pages=53–109 |url= http://heatisland.lbl.gov/publications/potential-benefits-cool-roofs-commercial-buildings-conserving-energy-saving-money-and-r }}&lt;/ref&gt; looking at this issue for air-conditioned commercial buildings across the United States found that the summer cooling savings typically outweigh the winter heating penalty even in cold climates near the Canada–US border giving savings in both electricity and emissions. Without a proper maintenance program to keep the material clean, the energy savings of cool roofs can diminish over time due to [[albedo]] degradation and soiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bretz|first=Sarah |author2=Hashem Akbari |title=Long-term performance of high albedo roof coatings|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=159–167|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(96)01005-5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778896010055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and practical experience with the degradation of roofing membranes over a number of years have shown that heat from the sun is one of the most potent factors that affects durability. High temperatures and large variations, seasonally or daily, at the roofing level are detrimental to the longevity of roof membranes. Reducing the extremes of temperature change will reduce the incidence of damage to membrane systems. Covering membranes with materials that reflect ultraviolet and infrared radiation will reduce damage caused by u/v and heat degradation. White surfaces reflect more than half of the radiation that reaches them, while black surfaces absorb almost all. White or white coated roofing membranes, or white gravel cover would appear to be the best approach to control these problems where membranes must be left exposed to solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maxwell C Baker|title=Roofs: Design, Application and Maintenance|publisher=Polyscience Publications|date=1980|isbn=978-0-921317-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If all urban, flat roofs in warm climates were whitened, the resulting 10% increase in global reflectivity would offset the warming effect of 24&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, or equivalent to taking 300 million cars off the road for 20 years. This is because a {{convert|1,000|sqft|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} white roof will offset 10 tons of carbon dioxide over its 20-year lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=California Energy Commission |title=Residential Compliance Manual For California's 2005 Energy Efficiency Standards|date=2005|publisher=California Energy Commission|location=Sacramento, CA|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-005/CEC-400-2005-005-CMF.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a real-world 2008 case study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campra|first=Pablo |author2=Monica Garcia |author3=Yolanda Canton |author4=Alicia Palacios-Orueta |title= Surface temperature cooling trends and negative radiative forcing due to land use change toward greenhouse farming in southeastern Spain|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=2008|volume=113|issue=D18 |pages=D18109 | doi= 10.1029/2008JD009912 |url= http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2008JD009912.shtml |bibcode=2008JGRD..11318109C}}&lt;/ref&gt; of large-scale cooling from increased reflectivity, it was found that the Province of Almeria, Southern Spain, has cooled 1.6&amp;nbsp;°C over a period of 20 years compared to surrounding regions, as a result of polythene-covered greenhouses being installed over a vast area that was previously open desert. In the summer the farmers whitewash these roofs to cool their plants down.

When sunlight falls on a white roof much of it is reflected and passes back through the atmosphere into space. But when sunlight falls on a dark roof most of the light is absorbed and re-radiated as much longer wavelengths, which are absorbed by the atmosphere. (The gases in the atmosphere that most strongly absorb these long wavelengths have been termed "greenhouse gases").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.ca.gov/commissioners/rosenfeld_docs/2010-10-11_Cool_Roofs_Science_at_Theater_Berkeley.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by researchers at Concordia University included variables similar to those used in the Stanford study (e.g., cloud responses) and estimated that worldwide deployment of cool roofs and pavements in cities would generate a global cooling effect equivalent to offsetting up to 150&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions – enough to take every car in the world off the road for 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Akbari |first= Hashem |author2=H Damon Matthews |author3=Donny Seto |title= The long-term effect of increasing the albedo of urban areas |journal= Environ.

==Disadvantages==
A 2011 study by researchers at [[Stanford University]] suggested that although reflective roofs decrease temperatures in buildings and mitigate the "[[urban heat island]] effect", they may actually increase global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/Others/HeatIsland+WhiteRfs0911.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubbling.com/featured_jubbling/the-roof-your-wife-painted-white-last-summer-should-be-painted-back-to-black|title=You Know The Roof Your Wife Painted White Last Summer?  Well, She Needs To Paint It Black Again.|author=|date=|work=jubbling.com|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that it did not account for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that results from building [[energy conservation]] (annual cooling energy savings less annual heating energy penalty) associated with cool roofs (meaning that one will need to use more energy to heat the living space due to reduction in heat from sunlight in winter.) However, this applies only to those areas with low winter temperatures – not tropical climates. Also, homes in areas receiving snow in winter months are unlikely to receive significantly more heat from darker roofs, as they will be snow-covered most of the winter. A response paper titled "Cool Roofs and Global Cooling," by researchers in the Heat Island Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, raised additional concerns about the validity of these findings, citing the uncertainty acknowledged by the authors, statistically insignificant numerical results, and insufficient granularity in analysis of local contributions to global feedbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Menon |first= Surabi |author2=Ronnen Levinson |author3=Marc Fischer |author4=Dev Millstein |author5=Nancy Brown |author6=Francisco Salamanca |author7=Igor Sednev |author8=Art Rosenfeld |title= Cool Roofs and Global Cooling|date=2011|url=http://heatisland.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/LBNL%20Heat%20Island%20Group%20response%20to%20Jacobson%20and%20Ten%20Hoeve%20(2011),%20November%204%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, 2012 research at [[University of California, San Diego]]'s [[Jacobs School of Engineering]] into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings found that, unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass or other mitigation factors, solar radiation reflected off light-colored pavements can increase the temperature in nearby buildings, increasing air conditioning demands and energy usage.&lt;ref name=Yaghoobian&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yaghoobian | first1 = N. | last2 = Kleissl | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.uclim.2012.09.002 | title = Effect of reflective pavements on building energy use | journal = Urban Climate | volume = 2 | pages = 25–42 | year = 2012 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a team of researchers, led by Matei Georgescu, an assistant professor in [[Arizona State University]]'s School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning and a senior sustainability scientist in the [[Global Institute of Sustainability]], explored the relative effectiveness of some of the most common adaptation technologies aimed at reducing warming from urban expansion. Results of the study indicate that the performance of urban adaptation technologies can counteract this increase in temperature, but also varies seasonally and is geographically dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20140210-urban-heat-tech-effectiveness|title=Research reveals effectiveness of urban heat-reducing technologies|author=Skip Derra|date=2014-02-10|work=ASU Now: Access, Excellence, Impact|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, what works in California’s Central Valley, such as cool roofs, does not necessarily provide the same benefits to other regions of the country, like Florida. Assessing consequences that extend beyond near surface temperatures, such as rainfall and energy demand, reveals important trade-offs that are often unaccounted for. Cool roofs have been found to be particularly effective for certain areas during summertime. However, during winter, these same urban adaptation strategies, when deployed in northerly locations, further cool the environment, and consequently require additional heating to maintain comfort levels. “The energy savings gained during the summer season, for some regions, is nearly entirely lost during the winter season,” Georgescu said. In Florida, and to a lesser extent southwestern states, there is a very different effect caused by cool roofs. “In Florida, our simulations indicate a significant reduction in precipitation," he said. "The deployment of cool roofs results in a 2 to 4 millimeter per day reduction in rainfall, a considerable amount (nearly 50 percent) that will have implications for water availability, reduced stream flow and negative consequences for ecosystems. For Florida, cool roofs may not be the optimal way to battle the urban heat island because of these unintended consequences.” Overall, the researchers suggest that judicious planning and design choices should be considered in trying to counteract rising temperatures caused by urban sprawl and greenhouse gases. They add that “urban-induced climate change depends on specific geographic factors that must be assessed when choosing optimal approaches, as opposed to one-size-fits-all solutions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/04/1322280111|title=Urban adaptation can roll back warming of emerging megapolitan regions|first1=Matei|last1=Georgescu|first2=Philip E.|last2=Morefield|first3=Britta G.|last3=Bierwagen|first4=Christopher P.|last4=Weaver|date=5 February 2014|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=8|pages=2909–14|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1322280111|pmid=24516126|pmc=3939866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of Advanced Energy Design Guides were developed in cooperation with [[ASHRAE]] (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers), AIA (The [[American Institute of Architects]]), [[IESNA]] (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America), [[USGBC]] (United States Green Building Council) and [[US DOE]] (United States Department of Energy) in 2011. These guides were aimed at achieving 50% Energy Savings toward a Net Zero Energy Building and covered the building types of Small to Medium Office Buildings, Medium to Big Box Retail Buildings, Large Hospitals and K-12 School Buildings. In Climate Zones 4 and above the recommendation is to follow the [[ASHRAE 90.1]] standard for roof reflectance, which currently does not require roofs to be reflective in these zones. In Climate Zones 4 and above, Cool Roofs are not a recommended Design Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/advanced-energy-design-guides|title=Advanced Energy Design Guides|author=|date=|work=ashrae.org|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of Advanced Energy Retrofit Guides for “Practical Ways to Improve Energy Performance” were developed in cooperation with the [[US DOE]] (United States Department of Energy) and [[PNNL]] (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) in 2011. These guides were aimed at improvements to existing Retail and Office buildings which could improve their energy efficiency. Cool roofs were not recommended for all locations. “This measure is likely more cost-effective in the hot and humid climate zone, which has a long cooling season, than in the very cold climate zone, for example. For buildings located in warm climates, this measure is worth consideration.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnl.gov/publications/abstracts.asp?report=378139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-20814.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copper Development Association]] has conducted several studies, beginning in 2002, which examined the elevated temperatures of wiring inside conduits at and above various color roof materials. The findings concluded that the temperatures above cool roofs were higher than those of a darker colored roof material. This illustrates the idea in which deflected solar radiation, when impeded by rooftop equipment, piping, or other materials will be subjected to the heat gain of the radiation.&lt;ref&gt;http://coolroofs.org/documents/Exhibit_6-Travis_Lindsey_Presentation_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[US DOE]]’s "Guidelines for Selecting Cool Roofs":
“Cool roofs must be considered in the context of your surroundings. It is relatively easy to specify a cool roof and predict energy savings, but some thinking ahead can prevent other headaches. Ask this question before installing a cool roof: Where will the reflected sunlight go?
A bright, reflective roof could reflect light and heat into the higher windows of taller neighboring buildings. In sunny conditions, this could cause uncomfortable glare and unwanted heat for you or your neighbors. Excess heat caused by reflections increases air conditioning energy use, negating some of the energy saving benefits of the cool roof.”&lt;ref name="www1.eere.energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/coolroofguide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213062754/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/coolroofguide.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[US DOE]]'s "Guidelines for Selecting Cool Roofs" on the subject of cool roof maintenance:
"As a cool roof becomes dirty from pollution, foot traffic, wind-deposited debris, ponded water, and mold or algae growth, its reflectance will decrease, leading to higher temperatures. Especially dirty roofs may perform substantially worse than product labels indicate. Dirt from foot traffic may be minimized by specifying designated walkways or by limiting access to the roof. Steep sloped roofs have less of a problem with dirt accumulation because rainwater can more easily wash away dirt and debris. Some cool roof surfaces are “self-cleaning” which means they shed dirt more easily and may better retain their reflectance. Cleaning a cool roof can restore solar reflectance close to its installed condition. Always check with your roof manufacturer for the proper cleaning procedure, as some methods may damage your roof. While it is generally not cost effective to clean a roof just for the energy savings, roof cleaning can be integrated as one component of your roof’s routine maintenance program. It is therefore best to estimate energy savings based on weathered solar reflectance values rather than clean roof values."&lt;ref name="www1.eere.energy.gov"/&gt;

==Properties==
When the sunlight strikes a dark rooftop, about 15% of it gets reflected back into the sky but most of its energy is absorbed into the roof system in the form of heat. Cool roofs reflect significantly more sunlight and absorb less heat than traditional dark-colored roofs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines For Selecting Cool Roofs|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/coolroofguide.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=30 December 2013|author=Urban, Bryan|author2=Roth, Kurt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two properties that are used to measure the effects of cool roofs:
* Solar reflectance, also known as [[albedo]], is the ability to reflect sunlight. It is expressed either as a decimal fraction or a percentage. A value of 0 indicates that the surface absorbs all [[solar radiation]], and a value of 1 represents total reflectivity.
* [[Thermal emittance]] is the ability to emit absorbed heat. It is also expressed either as a decimal fraction between 0 and 1, or a percentage.

Another method of evaluating coolness is the solar reflectance index (SRI), which incorporates both solar reflectance and emittance in a single value. SRI measures the roof's ability to reject solar heat, defined such that a standard black (reflectance 0.05, emittance 0.90) is 0 and a standard white (reflectance 0.80, emittance 0.90) is 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levinson|first=Ronnen|title=Cool Roof Q &amp; A (draft)|date=2009|url=http://heatisland.lbl.gov/sites/heatisland.lbl.gov/files/Cool-roof-Q+A.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A perfect SRI is approximately 122, the value for a perfect mirror, which absorbs no sunlight and has very low emissivity. The only practical material which approaches this level is stainless steel with an SRI of 112. High-reflectivity, low-emissivity roofs maintain a temperature very close to ambient at all times preventing heat gains in hot climates and minimizing heat loss in cold climates. High emissivity roofs have much higher heat loss in cold climates for the same insulation values.

==Roof Savings Calculator==
The Roof Savings Calculator (RSC) is a tool developed by the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] which estimates cooling and heating savings for low-slope roof applications with white and black surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roofcalc.com/index.shtml|title=Roof Savings Calculator (RSC) - DOE ORNL LBNL CEC EPA|author=|date=|work=roofcalc.com|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tool was the collaboration of both [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in order to provide industry-consensus roof savings for both residential and commercial buildings. It reports the net annual energy savings (cooling energy savings minus heating penalties) and thus is only applicable to the buildings with a heating and/or cooling system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.ornl.gov/index.shtml|title=Roof Savings Calculator (RSC) - DOE ORNL LBNL CEC EPA|website=rsc.ornl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of cool roofs==
Cool roofs fall into one of three categories: roofs made from cool roofing materials, roofs made of materials that have been coated with a solar reflective coating, or green roofs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Cool roofs===
White thermoplastic membrane roofs (PVC and TPO), are inherently reflective, achieving some of the highest reflectance and emittance measurements of which roofing materials are capable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} A roof made of white thermoplastic, for example, can reflect 80 percent or more of the sun’s rays and emit at least 70% of the solar radiation that the roof absorbs. An [[asphalt]] roof only reflects between 6 and 26% of solar radiation.

In addition to the white Thermoplastic PVC and TPO membranes used in many commercial cool roof applications, there is also research in the field of cool asphalt shingles. Asphalt shingles make up the majority of the North American residential roofing market, and consumer preferences for darker colors make creating solar-reflective shingles a particular challenge, causing asphalt shingles to have solar reflectances of only 4%-26%. When these roofs are designed to reflect increased amount of solar radiation, the urban heat island effect can be reduced through the reduced need for cooling costs in the summer. Though a more reflective roof can lead to higher heating costs in the colder months, studies have shown that the increased winter heating costs are still lower than the summer cooling cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cool Roofs|url=https://heatisland.lbl.gov/coolscience/cool-roofs|website=Heat Island Group|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy the consumer demands for darker colors which still reflect significant amounts of sunlight, different materials, coating processes, and pigments are used. Since only 43% of light occurs in the visible light spectrum, reflectance can be improved without affecting color by increasing the reflectance of UV and IR light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levinson|first1=Ronnen|title=Methods of creating solar-reflective nonwhite surfaces and their application to residential roofing materials|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=2007-02-15|volume=91|issue=4|pages=304–314|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2006.06.062}}&lt;/ref&gt; High surface roughness can also contribute to the low solar reflectances of asphalt shingles, as these shingles are made of many small approximately spherical granules which have a high surface roughness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berdahl|first1=Paul|title=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells 92 (2008) 482–489 Surface roughness effects on the solar reflectance of cool asphalt shingles|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=2007-02-16|volume=92|issue=4|pages=482–489|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2007.10.011|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc897002/}}&lt;/ref&gt; To decrease this, other granule materials are being investigated, such as flat rock flakes, which could reduce the reflectance inefficiencies due to surface roughness. Another alternative is to coat the granules using a dual coat process: the outer coating would have the desired color pigment, though it may not be very reflective, while the inner coating is a highly reflective titanium dioxide coating.

The highest SRI rating, and the coolest roofs, are stainless steel roofs, which are just several degrees above ambient under medium wind conditions. Their SRI's range from 100 to 115. Some are also hydrophobic so they stay very clean and maintain their original SRI even in polluted environments. [A]

===Coated roofs===
An existing (or new) roof can be made reflective by applying a solar reflective coating to its surface. The reflectivity and emissivity ratings for over 500 reflective coatings can be found in the Cool Roofs Rating Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolroofs.org/|title=Cool Roof Rating Council|author=|date=|work=coolroofs.org|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue and red roofs ===
Researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] have determined that a pigment used by the ancient Egyptians known as "[[Egyptian blue]]" absorbs visible light, and emits light in the near-infrared range. It may be useful in construction materials to keep roofs and walls cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heatisland.lbl.gov/news/article/egyptian-blue-energy-efficiency|title=Egyptian Blue for Energy Efficiency|last=|first=|date=October 9, 2018|website=Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Heat Island Group|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/egyptian-blue-artificial-pigment-solar-energy-1366508-2018-10-11|title=World's 1st artificially-made pigment Egyptian blue, can help produce solar energy|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2018|website=India Today|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/10/11/scientists-give-solar-pv-a-paint-job/|title=Scientists give solar PV a paint job|last=|first=|date=October 9, 2018|website=PV magazine USA|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also developed fluorescent ruby red coatings which have reflective properties similar to white roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/09/21/ruby-red-roofs-stay-cool-white-roofs/|title=We’re Not in Kansas Anymore: Fluorescent Ruby Red Roofs Stay as Cool as White|last=Chao|first=Julie|date=2016-09-21|work=Berkeley Lab News Center|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caddigest.com/are-ruby-red-crystals-the-secret-to-cool-roofs/|title=Are Ruby Red Crystals the Secret to Cool Roofs?|last=|first=|date=2016-09-28|work=CADdigest|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green roofs ===
{{main|Green Roof}}
Green roofs provide a thermal mass layer which helps reduce the flow of heat into a building. The solar reflectance of green roofs varies depending on the plant types (generally 0.3–0.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levinson|first=Ronnen|title=Cool Roofs, Cool Cities, Cool Planet|url=http://heatisland.lbl.gov/resources/2|accessdate=10 December 2011|format=PowerPoint Slides|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green roofs may not reflect as much as a cool roof but do have other benefits such as evapotranspiration which cools the plants and the immediate area around the plants, aiding in lowering rooftop temperatures but increasing humidity, naturally. Moreover, some Green roofs need maintenance such as regular watering.

==Cool climates==
In some climates where there are more heating days than cooling days, white reflective roofs may not be effective in terms of energy efficiency or savings because the savings on cooling energy use can be outweighed by heating penalties during winter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, heating accounts for 36% of commercial buildings' annual energy consumption, while air conditioning only accounts for 8% in United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Energy Information Administration|title=Table E1A. Major Fuel Consumption by End Use for All Buildings, 2003|url=http://www.eia.gov/emeu/cbecs/cbecs2003/detailed_tables_2003/2003set19/2003pdf/e01a.pdf|work=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy calculators generally show a yearly net savings for dark-colored roof systems in cool climates.

A perfect roof would absorb no heat in the summer and lose no heat in the winter. To do this it would need a very high SRI to eliminate all radiative heat gains in summer and losses in winter. High SRI roofs act as a [[radiant barrier]], providing a thermos-bottle effect. High emissivity cool roofs carry a climate penalty due to winter radiative heat losses, which reflective bare metal roofs, such as stainless steel, do not.

==Case studies==
In a 2001 federal study, the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) measured and calculated the reduction in peak energy demand associated with a cool roof’s surface reflectance.&lt;ref name="Konopacki 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konopacki|first=Steven J.|author2=Hashem Akbari |title=Measured energy savings and demand reduction from a reflective roof membrane on a large retail store in Austin|date=2001|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7gw9f9sc|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|id=LBNL-47149}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBNL found that, compared to the original black rubber roofing membrane on the Texas retail building studied, a retrofitted vinyl membrane delivered an average decrease of 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75.2&amp;nbsp;°F) in surface temperature, an 11% decrease in aggregate air conditioning energy consumption, and a corresponding 14% drop in peak hour demand. The average daily summertime temperature of the black roof surface was {{convert|75|°C|°F}}, but once retrofitted with a white reflective surface, it measured {{convert|52|°C|°F}}. Without considering any tax benefits or other utility charges, annual energy expenditures were reduced by $7,200 or $0.07/square foot.(This figure is for energy charges as well as peak demand charges).

Instruments measured weather conditions on the roof, temperatures inside the building and throughout the roof layers, and air conditioning and total building power consumption. Measurements were taken with the original black rubber roofing membrane and then after replacement with a white vinyl roof with the same insulation and HVAC systems in place.

Though a full year of actual data was collected, due to aberrations in the data, one month of data was excluded along with several other days which didn't meet the parameters of the study. Only 36 continuous pre-retrofit days were used and only 28 non-continuous operating days were used for the post-retrofit period.&lt;ref name="Konopacki 2001"/&gt;

Another case study, conducted in 2009 and published in 2011, was completed by Ashley-McGraw Architects and CDH Energy Corp for Onondaga County Dept. of Corrections, in Jamesville, New York, evaluated energy performance of a green or vegetative roof, a dark [[EPDM]] roof and a white reflective [[Thermoplastic olefin|TPO]] roof. The measured results showed that the TPO and vegetative roof systems had much lower roof temperatures than the conventional [[EPDM]] surface. The reduction in solar absorption reduced solar gains in the summer but also increased heat losses during the heating season. Compared to the [[EPDM]] membrane, the TPO roof had 30% higher heating losses and the vegetative roof had 23% higher losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdhenergy.com/presentations/ashley%20roof%20final%20report-Oct%202011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224110934/http://www.cdhenergy.com/presentations/ashley%20roof%20final%20report-Oct%202011.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotional programs==

===Across the U.S. federal government===
In July 2010, the [[United States Department of Energy]] announced a series of initiatives to more broadly implement cool roof technologies on DOE facilities and buildings across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Takes Steps to Implement Cool Roofs across the Federal Government|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=16175|publisher=United States Department of Energy|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the new efforts, DOE will install a cool roof, whenever cost effective over the lifetime of the roof, during construction of a new roof or the replacement of an old one at a DOE facility.

In October 2013, the [[United States Department of Energy]] ranked Cool Roofs as a 53 out of 100 (0 to 100 weighted average) for a cost effective energy strategy.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;http://energy.gov/eere/femp/articles/new-and-underutilized-technology-cool-roofs&lt;/ref&gt; "Climate issues can affect cool roof performance. Cool roofs are more beneficial in warmer climates and may cause energy consumption for heating applications to rise in colder climates. Cool roofs have a lower impact the more insulation is used. The Secretary of Energy directed all U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offices to install cool roofs, when life-cycle cost effectiveness is demonstrated, when constructing new roofs, or when replacing old roofs at DOE facilities. Other Federal agencies were also encouraged to do the same."&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;

Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the U.S. Department of Energy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help businesses and consumers save money by making energy-efficient product choices.

For low-slope roof applications, a roof product qualifying for the Energy Star label under its Roof Products Program must have an initial solar reflectivity of at least 0.65, and weathered reflectance of at least 0.50, in accordance with EPA testing procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roof Products Key Product Criteria|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=roof_prods.pr_crit_roof_products|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warranties for reflective roof products must be equal in all material respects to warranties offered for comparable non-reflective roof products, either by a given company or relative to industry standards.

Unlike other Energy Star-rated products, such as appliances, this rating system does not look at the entire roof assembly, but only the exterior surface. Consumers (i.e. building owners) may believe that the Energy Star label means their roof is energy-efficient; however, the testing is not as stringent as their appliance standard and does not include the additional components of a roof (i.e. roof structure, fire rated barriers, insulation, adhesives, fasteners, etc.).&lt;ref name="energystar.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/certified-products/detail/roof_products|title=All Certified Products - ENERGY STAR Qualified Products|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disclaimer is posted on their website "Although there are inherent benefits in the use of reflective roofing, before selecting a roofing product based on expected energy savings consumers should explore the expected calculated results that can be found on the Department of Energy's "Roof Savings Calculator" website at www.roofcalc.com. Please remember the Energy Savings that can be achieved with reflective roofing is highly dependent on facility design, insulation used, climatic conditions, building location, and building envelope efficiency."&lt;ref name="energystar.gov"/&gt;

===Cool Roof Rating Council===
Cool Roof Rating Council &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolroofs.org/|title=Cool Roof Rating Council|author=|date=|work=coolroofs.org|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CRRC) has created a rating system for measuring and reporting the solar reflectance and thermal emittance of roofing products. This system has been put into an online directory of more than 850 roofing products and is available for energy service providers, building code bodies, architects and specifiers, property owners and community planners. CRRC conducts random testing each year to ensure the credibility of its rating directory.

CRRC’s rating program allows manufacturers and sellers to appropriately label their roofing products according to specific CRRC measured properties. The program does not, however, specify minimum requirements for solar reflectance or thermal emittance.

===Green Globes===
The [[Green Globe]] system is used in Canada and the United States. In the U.S., Green Globes is owned and operated by the Green Building Initiative (GBI). In Canada, the version for existing buildings is owned and operated by BOMA Canada under the brand name 'Go Green' (Visez vert).

Green Globe uses performance benchmark criteria to evaluate a building’s likely energy consumption, comparing the building design against data generated by the EPA’s Target Finder, which reflects real building performance. Buildings may earn a rating of between one and four globes. This is an online system; a building’s information is verified by a Green Globes-approved and trained licensed engineer or architect. To qualify for a rating, roofing materials must have a solar reflectance of at least 0.65 and thermal emittance of at least 0.90. As many as 10 points may be awarded for 1–100 percent roof coverage with either vegetation or highly reflective materials or both. The basis in physics of a high emittance is quite questionable, since it merely describes a material which easily radiates infrared wavelength heat to the environment, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Highly reflective, low-emittance materials are much better at reducing energy consumption.

===LEED===
The U.S. Green Building Council’s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system is a voluntary, continuously evolving national standard for developing high performance sustainable buildings. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} LEED provides standards for choosing products in designing buildings, but does not certify products.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Unlike a [[building code]], such as the [[International Building Code]], only members of the [[USGBC]] and specific "in-house" committees may add, subtract or edit the standard, based on an internal review process. Model Building Codes are voted on by members and "in-house" committees, but allow for comments and testimony from the general public during each and every code development cycle at Public Review hearings, generally held multiple times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/codes/Pages/default.aspx|title=Code Development|author=|date=2015-01-02|work=iccsafe.org|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the LEED 2009 version, to receive Sustainable Sites Credit 7.2 Heat Island Effect-Roof, at least 75% of the surface of a roof must use materials having a solar reflective index (SRI) of at least 78. This criterion can also be met by installing a vegetated roof for at least 50% of the roof area, or installing a high [[albedo]] and vegetated roof in combination that meets this formula: (Area of Roof meeting Minimum SRI Roof/0.75) + (Area of vegetated roof/0.5) ≥ Total Roof Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=U.S. Green Building Council|title=LEED 2009 for New Construction and Major Renovations Rating System|date=2009|publisher=United States Green Building Council, Inc.|location=Washington, DC|pages=20|url=http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cool Roofs Europe and other countries===
This project is co-financed by the European Union in the framework of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme.

The aim of the proposed action is to create and implement an Action Plan for the cool roofs in EU. The specific objectives are: to support policy development by transferring experience and improving understanding of the actual and potential contributions by cool roofs to heating and cooling consumption in the EU; to remove and simplify the procedures for cool roofs integration in construction and building’s stock; to change the behaviour of decision-makers and stakeholders so to improve acceptability of the cool roofs; to disseminate and promote the development of innovative legislation, codes, permits and standards, including application procedures, construction and planning permits concerning cool roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market challenges on cool roofs|url=http://coolroofs.univ-lr.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=22&amp;lang=en%20market%20barriers|publisher=EU Cool Roofs Council|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work will be developed in four axes, technical, market, policy and end-users.

==Urban heat island effect==
{{main|Urban heat islands}}
An urban heat island occurs where the combination of heat-absorbing infrastructure such as dark asphalt parking lots and road pavement and expanses of black rooftops, coupled with sparse vegetation, raises air temperature by 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;°C higher than the temperature in the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oke|first=TR|title=Urban Climates and Global Environmental Change|publisher=Applied Climatology: Principles &amp; Practices|location=New York, NY|pages=273–287|editor=Thompson, R.D. |editor2=Perry, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/heatisland/|title=Heat Island Effect|author=|date=2014-02-28|work=epa.gov|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Green building]] programs advocate the use of cool roofing to mitigate the urban heat island effect and the resulting poorer air quality (in the form of smog) the effect causes. By reflecting sunlight, light-colored roofs minimize the temperature rise and reduce cooling energy use and smog formation. A study by LBNL showed that, if strategies to mitigate this effect, including cool roofs, were widely adopted, the Greater Toronto metropolitan area could save more than $11 million annually on energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konopacki|first=Steven|author2=Hashem Akbari |title=Energy impacts of heat island reduction strategies in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada|date=2001|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4w2091fk|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] enacted to prevent atrocities against [[scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]]. The Act is popularly known as '''the SC/ST Act''', POA, the Prevention of Atrocities Act, or simply the Atrocities Act.

It was enacted when the provisions of the existing laws (such as the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 and Indian Penal Code) were found to be inadequate to check these crimes (defined as 'atrocities' in the Act)&lt;ref&gt;The Statement of the object and reasons for SC/ST(PoA)ACT 1989&lt;/ref&gt;. Recognising the continuing gross indignities and offences against Scheduled Castes and Tribes, the Parliament passed the ‘Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989.

The preamble of the Act also states that the Act is:
: ''“to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, to provide for Special Courts for the trial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such offences and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”''

Thus objectives of the Act clearly emphasise the intention of the government to deliver justice to these communities through proactive efforts to enable them to live in society with dignity and self-esteem and without fear or violence or suppression from the dominant castes. The practice of untouchability, in its overt and covert form was made a cognizable and non compoundable offence, and strict punishment is provided for any such offence.

The SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 with stringent provisions (which extends to whole of India except the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir) was enacted on 9 September 1989. Section 23(1) of the Act authorises the Central Government to frame rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act. Drawing power from this section, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) ''Rules'' of 1995 were framed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/poa-rule.php?pageid=1|title=Error : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - Government of India|website=socialjustice.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for the Act were notified on 31 March 1995.

The purpose of the Act was to help the social inclusion of [[Dalits]] into Indian society, but the Act has failed to live up to its expectations admitted by the Union Minister for Home Affairs in parliament on 30 August 2010 (quoted below).&lt;ref name="164.100.47.132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result15.aspx?dbsl=3161&amp;ser=&amp;smode=t#3000*25|title=Home Minister P Chidambaram in Lok Sabha (Lower House of Indian Parliament) on 30 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A number of cases of misuse of this Act has been reported from different parts of the country as mentioned in the Supreme Court verdict of 20 March 2018. In this verdict, the Supreme Court of India banned immediate arrest of a person accused of insulting or injuring a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe member to protect innocents from arbitrary arrest.

In August, 2018, the parliament of India passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill, 2018, to bypass the ruling of the Supreme Court of India laying down procedures for arrests under the Act. The bill inserts section 18A (1) (a) in the 1989 Act, that says a “preliminary enquiry shall not be required for registration of an FIR against any person.” The Bill also inserts Section 18A (1) (b), which says “the investigating officer shall not require approval for the arrest, if necessary, of any person against whom an accusation of having committed an offence under this Act has been made and no procedure, other than that provided under this Act or the Code, shall apply.”
The act violates “basic principles of liberty and accountability” after the amendments. According to a plea filed in the Supreme Court, “the Supreme Court cannot remain a mute spectator to the abuse of law as we are living in a civilised society and there were many growing instances of misuse of this act. The new law could be used to harass citizens by arresting them on the basis of mere allegations. The amendment excludes Section 438 of CrPC, violates constitutional mandate under Articles 14 and 21.” The amendments rule out any provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of atrocities against SC/STs, notwithstanding any court order. 


== Historical sketch ==

The post-Independence era was marked by frequent instances of atrocities springing up across the country: for example, the assassination of the young, educated Dalit leader Emmanuel Sekaran in Tamil Nadu for defying the untouchability-based interdicts on Scheduled Castes (SCs, also called Dalits), which resulted in the Ramanathapuram riots of 1957; the Kilavenmani massacre of 42 Dalits in 1968 in Tamil Nadu; the gruesome killing of Dalit Kotesu in Kanchikacherla in 1969 in Andhra Pradesh; the killings of 10 Scheduled Tribes (STs, also called Adivasis, literally 'first dweller') by police in connection with a land dispute in Indravalli in Andhra Pradesh in 1978. All such events shook the then national leadership. Hence, under pressure from Dalit MPs, the Government of India started monitoring atrocities against SCs from 1974, and in the case of STs from 1981 onwards, with special focus on murder, rape, arson and grievous hurt.

Atrocities continued to rise with ferocity and frequency – for example, in Bihar the massacres of SCs at Belchi in 1979 and at Pipra in 1980; in Uttar Pradesh the massacre following a SC bridegroom riding on horseback at Kafalta in 1980; in Madhya Pradesh the killing of Bacchdas in Mandsaur district in 1982; in Bihar the killing in police firing on 15 STs at Banjhi in Sahibganj district in 1985. In all such cases, the Indian State at both the national and state levels avoided addressing basic contradictions, vulnerabilities and causative factors; the treatment was mainly symptomatic and palliative instead of the required radical solutions. Under continued pressure from Dalit MPs and political leaders, the magnitude and gravity of the problem was finally recognised by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. In his Independence Address on 15 August 1987, he announced that an Act would be passed, if necessary, to check atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Krishnan, ''‘Atrocities against Dalits: Retrospect and and and deProspect’'', Combat Law, Vol.8, Issue 5-6, 2009, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity ==

=== Atrocities rooted in caste system ===

A study conducted by the National Commission for SCs and STs in 1990 on ''Atrocities on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes: Causes and Remedies'' pointed out various causal factors for atrocities: land disputes; land alienation; bonded labour; indebtedness; non-payment of minimum wages; caste prejudice and practice of untouchability; political factions on caste lines; refusal to perform traditional works such as digging burial pits, arranging cremations, removing carcasses of dead animals and beating drums; etc. The deep root for such atrocities is traceable to the caste system, which “encompasses a complete ordering of social groups on the basis of the so-called ritual purity. A person is considered a member of the caste into which s/he is born and remains within that caste until death….”&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of SCs &amp; STs, 4th Report 2004-05, New Delhi, 2005, para 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered ritually impure, SCs have been physically and socially excluded from mainstream society, denied basic resources and services, and discriminated against in all areas of life. Accordingly, they face various forms of exploitation, insults and violence, as well as degrading practices of untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes were equally exploited on grounds of not falling within the caste system but having a distinct culture and worldview of their own. “Women belonging to these castes and tribes bore double burden. They were exploited by caste and gender, and were vulnerable to and powerless against sexual exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of SCs and STs, 4th Report 2004-05, New Delhi, 2005, para 1.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuing widespread prevalence ===

Despite the right to non-discrimination on the basis of race or caste enshrined in Article 15 of the Indian Constitution, discrimination against SCs and STs is pervasive. Though abolished and forbidden by Article 17, the practice of ‘untouchability’ persists due to its systemic character. Hence, the Indian Parliament enacted the Untouchability Offences Act 1955, which underwent amendment and renaming in 1976 to become the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act. Under this Act, ‘untouchability’ as a result of religious and social disabilities was made punishable. However, due to legal loopholes, the levels of punishments being less punitive as compared to those of the IPC, and the law and order machinery being neither professionally trained nor socially inclined to implement such social legislation, a more comprehensive and more punitive Act was required to protect SCs and STs from violence committed by other communities. This gave rise to the SC/ST (PoA) Act 1989.

== Objectives ==

The basic objective and purpose of this more comprehensive and more punitive piece of legislation was sharply enunciated when the Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha:
: ''“Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of the SCs and STs, they remain vulnerable… They have in several brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and property… Because of the awareness created… through spread of education, etc., when they assert their rights and resist practices of untouchability against them or demand statutory minimum wages or refuse to do any bonded and forced labour, the vested interests try to cow them down and terrorise them. When the SCs and STs try to preserve their self-respect or honour of their women, they become irritants for the dominant and the mighty…

: ''Under the circumstances, the existing laws like the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 and the normal provisions of the Indian Penal Code have been found to be inadequate to check and deter crimes against them committed by non-SCs and non-STs… It is considered necessary that not only the term 'atrocity' should be defined, but also stringent measures should be introduced to provide for higher punishment for committing such atrocities. It is also proposed to enjoin on the States and Union Territories to take specific preventive and punitive measures to protect SCs and STs from being victimized and, where atrocities are committed, to provide adequate relief and assistance to rehabilitate them.”''&lt;ref&gt;National Commission for SCs, First Report 2004-05, New Delhi, 2006, pp.222-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Act, therefore, very clearly emphasise the intention of the Indian state to deliver justice to SC/ST communities through affirmative action in order to enable them to live in society with dignity and self-esteem and without fear, violence or suppression from the dominant castes.&lt;ref&gt;NHRC, Report on Prevention of Atrocities against SCs, New Delhi, 2004, pp.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court of India too reiterated the significance and importance of the Act:&lt;ref&gt;State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr vs. Ram Krishna Balothia and Anr (1995) (2) SCC 221&lt;/ref&gt;
:

== Salient features ==

The provisions of SC/ST Act and Rules can be divided into three different categories, covering a variety of issues related to atrocities against SC/ST people and their position in society. 
* The first category contains provisions of criminal law. It establishes criminal liability for a number of specifically defined atrocities, and extends the scope of certain categories of penalizations given in the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
* The second category contains provisions for relief and compensation for victims of atrocities.
* The third category contains provisions that establish special authorities for the implementation and monitoring of the Act.

Together with the rules, it provides a framework for monitoring the state response to the atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. According to the Act and Rules, there are to be monthly reports (from the District Magistrates), quarterly review meetings at the district level by the District Monitoring and Vigilance Committee (DVMC) and half yearly reviews by a 25-member State Monitoring and Vigilance Committee (SVMC) the chaired by the Chief Minister. The performance of every Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) will also have to be reviewed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) every quarter. Annual reports have to be sent to the central government by 31 March every year.

The Act and Rules are a potent mechanism and precision instruments that can be used in tandem with the Right To Information (RTI) Act 2005 to motivate the state to hold the mandatory meetings and enforce compliance. A Human Rights Defenders [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/poa-5b-monitoring-calendar Monitoring Calendar] has been developed from the Act and rules to help human rights defenders, and others to clarify the [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/poa-8-dvmc-roles-and-responsibilities functions and duties of the monitoring authorities (the SVMC and DVMC)].

== Defining 'atrocity' ==

The term 'atrocity' was not defined until this Act was passed by the Parliament in 1989. In legal parlance, the Act understands the term to mean an offence punishable under sections 3(1) and 3(2).

In specific terms: 
# Atrocity is “an expression commonly used to refer to crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India”.
# It “denotes the quality of being shockingly cruel and inhumane, whereas the term 'crime' relates to an act punishable by law”.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of SCs &amp; STs, 4th Report 2004-05,New Delhi, 2005, para 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
# It implies “any offence under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) committed against SCs by non-SC persons, or against STs by non-ST persons. Caste consideration as a motive is not necessary to make such an offence in case of atrocity”.&lt;ref&gt;Clarification by Ministry of Home Affairs, noted in NHRC, Report on Prevention of Atrocities against SCs, New Delhi, 2002, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
# It signifies “crimes which have ingredients of infliction of suffering in one form or the other that should be included for reporting”. This is based on the assumption that “where the victims of crime are members of Scheduled Castes and the offenders do not belong to Scheduled Castes caste considerations are really the root cause of the crime, even though caste considerations may not be the vivid and minimum motive for the crime”.&lt;ref&gt;Clarification from Ministry of Home Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act lists 22 offences relating to various patterns of behaviours inflicting criminal offences for shattering the self-respect and esteem of SCs and STs, denial of economic, democratic and social rights, discrimination, exploitation and abuse of the legal process, etc.&lt;ref&gt;National Commission for SCs, First Report 2004- 05,New Delhi, 2006, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Act lists the criminal offences and the punishments. It contains: 
* 19 offences in their own right (Section 3(1) contains 15 subsections with an equal number of offences. Section 3(2) contains four subsections with offences)
* two derived offences (sections 3(2)(vi) and 3(2)(vii)). The derived offences are based on the offences given in the SC/ST Act. They only come in the picture provided that another offence under the SC/ST Act has been committed.
* one subsection that increases the punishment for certain offences under the IPC (Section 3(2)(v)).

These protections can be broadly divided into protection from 
* social disabilities (denial of access to certain places and to use customary passage and to get water from any spring, reservoir or any other source).
* personal atrocities (forceful drinking or eating of inedible or obnoxious substance, against stripping, outrage of modesty, sexual exploitation, injury or annoyance).
* atrocities affecting properties (land, residential premises, existing properties).
* malicious prosecution.
* political disabilities.
* economic exploitation.

The common denominator of the offences is that criminal liability can only be established if the offence is committed by a person who is '''''not''''' a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe '''''against''''' a person who belongs to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.

== Special Courts ==
For speedy trial, Section 14 of the Act provides for a Court of Session to be a Special Court to try offences under this Act in each district. Rule 13(i) mandates that the judge in a special court be sensitive with right aptitude and understanding of the problems of the SCs and STs.

However, that is seldom the case. Most states have declared a court as a 'special court'. The hitch is that they are designated courts (as opposed to exclusive special courts) and so have to hear many other cases too. Consequently, at any time about 80% of the cases are pending&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result15.aspx?dbsl=3161&amp;ser=&amp;smode=t#3000*25|title=Home Minister P Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Indian Parliament) on 30 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—defeating the very purpose of having special courts in the first place.

Special Court Justice Ramaswamy observed in the case of State of Karnataka v. Ingale&lt;ref name="1992 3 S.C.R. 284"&gt;(1992) 3 S.C.R. 284&lt;/ref&gt; that more than seventy-five percent of the cases brought under the SC/ST Act end in acquittal at all levels. The situation has not improved much since 1992 according to the figures given by the 2002 Annual Report dealing with SC/ST Act (of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/schedule/welcome.htm|title=Error : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - Government of India|website=socialjustice.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total cases filed in 2002 only 21.72% were disposed of, and, of those, a mere 2.31% ended in conviction. The number of acquittals is 6 times more than the number of convictions and more than 70 percent of the cases are still pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in|title=Census of India Website : Office of the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner,
        India|first=|last=ORGI|website=www.censusindia.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inaugurating a two-day annual conference of State Ministers of Welfare/Social Justice, 8 Sept 2009, Prime Minister Singh expressed 'shock' that the conviction rate of cases of atrocities against the SC/STs is less than 30% against the average of 42% for all cognisable offences under the Indian Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Atrocities-on-SCSTs-disturbing-Manmohan/article16879847.ece|title=Atrocities on SC/STs disturbing: Manmohan|first=Aarthi|last=Dhar|date=8 September 2009|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in rape cases the conviction rate is just 2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncrb.gov.in/CD-CII2011/cii-2011/Chapters.htm|title=Error page|website=ncrb.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karnataka has only 8 Special courts, though 15 of 30 districts are declared 'atrocity prone'. Overall conviction rates remain at or below 5%. Even the few special courts seem to be biased. In 2010, of the 101 cases disposed of in the Tumkur special court, not one was convicted. Gulbarga, another atrocity prone district had a conviction rate of just 2%. 7 districts had a conviction rate of 0% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openspace.org.in/files/2011%20Karnataka%20SCST%20POA%20Act%20monitoring.pdf|title=Karnataka State Report 2011|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044147/http://openspace.org.in/files/2011%20Karnataka%20SCST%20POA%20Act%20monitoring.pdf|archive-date=26 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==

According to Rule 7(1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialjustice.nic.in/poa-rule.php?pageid=4 7(1).— An offence committed under the Act shall be investigated by a police officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. The investigating officer shall be appointed by the State Government /Director General of Police/Superintendent of Police after taking into account his past experience, sense of ability and justice to perceive the implications of the case and investigate it along with right lines within the shortest possible time].&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of an offence committed under the SC/ST Act cannot be investigated by an officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP).

Various High Courts have set aside cases based on the above rule. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/schedule/welcome.htm|title=Error : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - Government of India|website=socialjustice.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is to ensure that the investigations are of high quality, and the assumption is that senior officials would not be as biased, nor as vulnerable to other pressures, as those in the lower rungs of the police force. 

The Andhra Pradesh High Court, in ''D. Ramlinga Reddy v. State of AP'',&lt;ref&gt;1999 Cr LJ 2918&lt;/ref&gt; took the position that provisions of Rule 7 are mandatory and held that investigation under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has to be carried out by only an officer not below the rank of DSP. An investigation carried out and charge sheet filed by an incompetent officer is more than likely to be quashed. Similarly, the Madras High Court in ''M. Kathiresam v. State of Tamil Nadu''&lt;ref&gt;1999 Cr LJ 3938&lt;/ref&gt; held that investigation conducted by an officer other than a DSP is improper and bad in law and proceedings based on such an investigation are required to be quashed.
The Courts without taking into consideration the inadequacies of the State, have been punishing SC/STs (the victims) for the same. Shri Pravin Rashtrapal, Member of Parliament rightly pointed out that there are insufficient officers at that level.&lt;ref&gt;Lok Sabha Debates, see http://164.100.24.208/ls/lsdeb/ls13/ses13/210803.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His statement is supported by the Annual Report of 2005-2006 of Ministry of Home Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mha.nic.in/annual_reports.htm Ministry of Home Affairs - Govt of India - India an Overview - India - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225110920/http://mha.nic.in/annual_reports.htm |date=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total posts sanctioned by the government under Indian Police Service (IPS) more than 15 percent of the posts are vacant. This basically means that there is one IPS officer for 77,000 SC/STs.33

In the case of Karnataka, there were no officers of the required rank in three districts, as admitted by the government at the State Vigilance and Monitoring Committee (SVMC) in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openspace.org.in/scstpoakarnataka2011|title=Implementation in Karnataka in 2010  - OpenSpace|website=openspace.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though officers of higher rank can conduct the investigation (the Act only says 'at least of rank'), in practice they seldom do.

== Compensation ==

Atrocities often take place when persons belonging to the SC ST community do not fulfill their 'caste functions' by doing ritually prescribed 'unclean' work or break the caste boundaries such as sitting in the bus or wearing a turban—often the preserve of the dominant castes. Atrocities are often a form of 'collective' punishment for daring to have even some semblance of non-dependence which is termed as 'prosperous', and the atrocity is to bring them back into the situation of total dependence and servitude. The state therefore has the duty to help the community back on its feet.

''In fact, a part of the reason why atrocities are committed is economic activity. In my experience, I have seen that in some areas, the Scheduled Caste or the Scheduled Tribe person is prosperous. My knowledge is mostly about the Scheduled Caste, not about the Scheduled Tribe. It is because of the economic activity, because of the enterprise, there are areas where the Scheduled Caste people have also become prosperous. The Scheduled Caste people are able to build brick and stone houses. The Scheduled Caste people are able to acquire vehicles. The Scheduled Caste people are able to dress better, send their children to better schools. One of the reasons why atrocities take place in those places is to cripple them economically. Every riot, every arson case cripples them economically. Therefore, it is important that the State must immediately rush in social and economic measures for the rehabilitation of those who have suffered through these atrocities.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result15.aspx?dbsl=3161&amp;ser=&amp;smode=t#3000*25|title=Home Minister P Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha on 30 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has prescribed a schedule for compensation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/amend-poa2014|title=POA 3a Relief Norms Notification 2014|website=www.slideshare.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Rule 12.(4)) as Annexure 1 entitled Norms for Relief Amount. This is periodically updated

== Record ==
As 'police' and 'public order' are state subjects, primary responsibility for prevention of atrocities and maintenance of law and order rests with the State Governments. A responsive police administration has always been recognized as an essential requirement in any society that seeks to take care of its citizens. Such responsive administration is essential for prevention of atrocities likely to be inflicted upon SCs and STs by unscrupulous non-SC/ST elements.

Section 21(1) and (2) of SC/ST (POA) Act, 1989 stipulate that the State Government shall take all such measures as may be necessary for its effective implementation. However, despite the Act and Rules, the situation has not changed much. The incidence of atrocities is actually increasing, and the implementation of the law leaves much to be desired as this statement of the Union Minister for Home Affairs shows:

''"Madam, I must concede that the statistics do not reflect any decline in the atrocities. On the contrary, the information compiled by the Crime Records Bureau shows that the number of cases registered of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes is, in fact, on the rise. I have the numbers from 2006 to 2008, subsequent years are being compiled. Take for example the case of the Scheduled Castes. The number of cases of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes registered in 2006 was 26,665. That itself is an understatement. Many of the cases are simply not registered. In 2007, it was 29,825 and in 2008 it was 33,365. So, this clearly shows the rise in trend.

''I can make one or two deductions from this. 
# ''Firstly that there is no let up in the atrocities committed on the Scheduled Castes.
# ''The other inference one can make is, perhaps, because of the pressure that is put on the State Governments by the Central Government, by public opinion and by NGOs, now the States are showing greater willingness to deal with the problem. Therefore, more cases are being registered.

''[...]

''
''We cannot be happy about the fact that approximately 33,000 cases are being registered as atrocities against Scheduled Castes in one year. What makes it even more disturbing is that while so many cases are registered, the conviction rate hovers around 30%. What makes it doubly painful is that there is rise in atrocities, but when you try to prosecute and convict, the conviction rate is only 30%. It was 28%, 31.4% and 32%. Not only are acquittals very high; pendency is about 80%. 
''
''[...]

''
''I am afraid that the disposal of the cases is low; the rate of conviction is low. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that the feeling amongst the Scheduled Castes and the Schedule Tribes that all these laws and all these statements, all these pronouncements have really not brought any relief to them. That feeling is running high and I cannot but say that feeling is justified."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;'' (p143,144 of the printed text).
''

23 States have set up SC/ST Protection Cells. Nodal Officers have been appointed in 28 States.&lt;ref name="164.100.47.132" /&gt;

Though the Act and rules are stringent, it is not a deterrent, as the Minister for Home Affairs P Chidambaram admitted in the Lok Sabha, referring to the Central Committee monitoring the implementation of the Act:

''A committee under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Social Justice was set up after the SCs and STs (PoA), 1989 was passed. That Committee has met, so far, 10 times. The situation in 25 States and 4 Union Territories were reviewed. That committee has expressed that the most important areas of concern are the following five:'' 
# ''firstly, the high rate of acquittal;
# ''secondly, the high rate of pendency of cases and very low rate of disposal;
# ''thirdly, inadequate use of the preventive provisions of the Act, while the punitive provisions are invoked and FIR is registered, preventive provisions are rarely invoked;
# ''fourthly, that the committees and other mechanisms provided in the Act have virtually not been put to use; and fifthly,
# ''the Act itself may not be deterrent, perhaps it is not being as deterrent as we thought it could be.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; PANKAJ

== Drawbacks and lacunae ==

=== Bias ===
Going through the Indian judicial system is degrading for any Dalit because of the still existing biases of the court judges. One example is the conduct of an Allahabad High Court judge who had his chambers "purified" with water from the ‘ganga jal’ because a Dalit judge had previously sat in that chamber before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/india |title=Human Rights Watch, "Broken People: Caste Violence Against India's Untouchables" |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example is the case of ''State of Karnataka v. Ingale''.&lt;ref name="1992 3 S.C.R. 284" /&gt; The State of Karnataka had charged five individuals with violating the SC/ST Act. At trial, four witnesses testified that the defendants had threatened Dalits with a gun to stop them from taking water from a well. The defendants told the Dalits that they had no right to take water, because they were `untouchables'. The trial judge convicted all of the defendants. On appeal, the Additional Sessions judge confirmed the conviction of three defendants but acquitted two. On further appeal to the High Court, the judge acquitted all the defendants after rejecting  testimony of the four Dalit witnesses. The Dalits finally got relief from the Supreme Court.

Perhaps the most important bias (re implementation of this Act) is that there is little done to prevent atrocities. Most of the reports are of what is done after an atrocity has been committed. Few states have preventive measures in place. The 'relief' provided is a pittance and the confidence of the community is seldom rebuilt.

For some, the low conviction rates are evidence of misuse of the Act by the SCs and STs to threaten and blackmail other communities. Actual data on such misuse is not available. However, the acquittal rates are abnormally high, as acknowledged by the prime minister and home minister (quoted above). There is also a high rate of FIRs rejected as being 'false' by the police, with 10% of the total cases investigated in 2016 being closed as 'false'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clpr.org.in/5896-2-police-investigation-data-pendency-charge-sheet-sc-st/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Karnataka the rejection rate at the police station level (the 'B' report that classifies a case as false) was 77% of total cases disposed off in 2009&lt;ref&gt;Karnataka State Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt;—so much so that it became a topic for discussion in the SVMC.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the SVMC meeting, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This narrative of 'false cases' and misuse of the Act also found voice in the March 2018 decision of the Supreme Court in ''[https://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2017/22086/22086_2017_Judgement_20-Mar-2018.pdf Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Anr.]'' In addition to questioning Section 18 of the Act, which prohibits grant of anticipatory bail for offences committed under the Act, the court laid down guidelines, substantially diluting the provisions of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clpr.org.in/wrong-turn-road-equality/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted additional powers to the investigating officer to conduct a preliminary inquiry before lodging a complaint. Further, written permission of the appointing authority for all public officials and of the District Superintendent of Police for other persons is required before a complaint is registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/opinion/dalits-see-the-apex-courts-order-on-sc-st-act-as-a-dog-whistle-to-destroy-the-law/48089/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clpr.org.in/dalits-see-apex-courts-order-scst-act-dog-whistle-destroy-law/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal system ===

The legal regime is fraught with contradictions. While the legal text is explicit in seeking remedies, the implementation of the text appears to evade actual performance. Laws and legal processes are not self-executing; they depend on the administrative structure and the judiciary with the anticipation that the social attitudes are driven by notions of equity, social justice and fair play.&lt;ref&gt;K.I. '''Vibhute''', “Right to Live with Human Dignity of Scheduled Castes and Tribes: Legislative Spirit and Social Response – Some Reflections”, 44 JILI (2002) 469 at 481.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasingly indifferent responses of those involved in the implementation of laws protecting the weak, the oppressed and the socially disadvantaged have persisted over the years and the system has failed to provide for self-correction. The problem is that the victims of atrocities suffer not only bodily and mental pain but also feelings of insecurity and social avoidance which is not present for the victims of other crimes. If the judge delegated to protect them shows indifference, it further aggravates their already vulnerable position.

=== Rehabilitation ===
According to the preamble of the SC/ST Act, it is an Act to '''prevent''' the commission of offences of atrocities against SC/STS, to provide for Special Courts for the trial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such offences. The Madhya Pradesh High Court also had the same view and observed in the case of Dr. Ram Krishna Balothia v. Union of India&lt;ref&gt;AIR 1994 MP 143&lt;/ref&gt; that the entire scheme of the SC/ST Act is to provide protection to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to provide for Special Court and speedy trial of the offences. The Act contains affirmative measures to weed out the root cause of atrocities, which has denied SCs and STs basic civil rights.
The Act has addressed the problem the regarding the dispensation of justice, but what the failed to deal with is the problem of ‘rehabilitation’. There is mention of rehabilitation under Section 21(2)(iii), but there are no provision addressing the same. As it has been stated earlier that victims of atrocities are on a different level when compared to victims of other crimes, hence there should be special provision for the same. According to the report submitted by the National Commission for Review and Working of the Constitution,&lt;ref name="Final Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ncrwc/finalreport/v2b3-7.htm|title=11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; victims of atrocities and their families should be provided with full financial and any other support to make them economically self-reliant without their having to seek wage employment from their very oppressors or classes of oppressors. Also it would be the duty of the state to immediately take over the educational needs of the children of such victims and provide for the cost of their food and maintenance.

SCs and STs constitute 68% of the total rural population. According to the 1991 agricultural census a large number of SCs and STs are marginal farmers compared to the other sections of the society and because of this the number of cultivators are going down. In other words, the landlessness is increasing at a faster rate among SCs and STs. At the same time, the number of SC and ST workers as agricultural labourer is increasing at a faster rate when compared to other sections of the society. This basically implies that after losing their land holdings, SC and ST cultivators are becoming agriculture labourers. Loss of land, on the one hand, is caused by atrocities making them more vulnerable. This in turn fuels and promotes continuance of atrocities and untouchability.

Marginalisation is one of the worst forms of oppression.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It expels a whole category of people from useful participation in the society and therefore potentially subjected to material deprivation and this could even lead to extermination. Moreover, this leads to the state of powerlessness which perhaps is best described negatively; the powerless lack authority, status and a sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Young, “Justice and Politics of Difference”. Amita Dhanda (compiled by), “Law and Poverty Reading Material – IV Semester B.A.B.L (Hons)”, 1st edition 2006, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, every right has three types of duties{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}—duty to
* Avoid deprivation.
* Protect from deprivation.
* Aid the deprived.

Though the SC/ST Act does cover these duties, and its implementation is admittedly uneven, it is found wanting most in the third: duty to aid the deprived. One possible reason could be that the State has to work through its officials who are drawn from the same oppressive social strata. Though the Act does mention that ''officers and other staff appointed in an area prone to atrocity shall have the right aptitude and understanding of the problems of the SCs and STs'' [http://socialjustice.nic.in/poa-rule.php?pageid=7 (Rule 13(1))] in practice, these officials often collude with their caste brethren and even file counter-cases against the victims or their family members.&lt;ref&gt;“Whenever the SC or ST victim of atrocity presents a report to the Sub-Inspector or Circle-Inspector in charge of Police Station and if he records F.I.R., and register a case, the Sub-Inspector or Circle-Inspector should arrest the assailant or assailants who committed the atrocity on the complaint-SC. But the Sub-Inspector or Circle-Inspector who recorded the F.I.R., and registered a case did not arrest the assailants except in rare cases. On the other hand, it is stated in their representations that those assailants against whom the SC-victims presented complaints lodge counter reports to the Police against SC-victims and the Sub-Inspectors or Circle-Inspectors register counter cases against the SCs (Victims) and arrest them. When a counter report is presented by the assailant who is the accused in the report presented by the SC-victim, it was filed obviously with the sole intention to counter blast the complaint filed by the SC-victim. As a result of the counter cases, the real SC victims of the atrocities are being arrested and subjected to criminal litigation as accused in the counter cases” (Justice Punnayya Commission, Government of Andhra Pradesh 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This means, in addition to the perpetrators getting away with the original crime, free to further intimidate the victims, the victims are left helpless—denied the government compensation and assistance to rebuild their life. They have to go back to the same perpetrator caste for their livelihood or daily wage labour. Hence, it is necessary to make the SCs and STs self-dependent.

=== Lack of awareness ===
The statement of object and reason of the SC/ST Act clearly reveals that the Act, in its letter and spirit, desires that Dalits lead a dignified life. However, even after 16 years of its existence in the statute book, it has not shown its desired effect.

The majority of the beneficiaries of this Act are unaware of the legitimate claims of leading a dignified way of life or are unwilling to enforce it intensively. Even the Police, prosecutors and judicial officers are unaware of this Act as was pointed out by Calcutta High Court in the case of ''M.C. Prasannan v. State of West Bengal''.&lt;ref&gt;1999 Cr LJ 998 (Cal)&lt;/ref&gt;

Misapplication of the Act by police and the courts aggravates the problem ultimately leads to acquittals.&lt;ref&gt;Karansingh v. State of MP, 1992 Cr LJ 3054 (MP)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some atrocities not covered ===
Social and economic boycott and blackmail are widespread. In view of the fact that the main perpetrators of the crime sometimes co-opt a few SC/STs with them and take advantage of local differences among the SC/STs and sometimes they promote and engineer crimes but get them executed by some members of SC/STs, the Act should be suitably amended to bring such crimes and atrocities within the purview of the definition of atrocities under the Act.&lt;ref name="Final Report" /&gt;

Likewise, the Special Courts established under Section 14 of the Act are required to follow the committal procedure under Cr.P.C. Such an interpretation prevents the speedy trial envisaged under the Act. The absence of adequate special courts has resulted in slow disposal of atrocity cases and a huge backlog.

== Empowering provisions ==

=== Migration ===

Under constitutional provisions, a caste or tribe is notified with reference to a State or Union territory. Hence a person born in state/UT gets certificate of SC/ST if his/her father belongs to specified caste/tribe in that state as SC/ST. On migration to another state, they lose their SC/ST status for affirmative actions, i.e. benefit of admission in educational institutes, reservation in government employment etc. ''but the protection accorded under this Act stays''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Once a person is notified as SC/ST in any state/UT, they are protected under the SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 throughout the country, irrespective of whether the particular caste or tribe is notified in the state/UT where the offence is committed.

=== Legal aid ===
Legal aid is available for all victims regardless of financial status. For all others legal aid depends on the financial status.

== Civil society response ==

=== Monitoring implementation ===

'''Comprehensive [http://openspace.org.in/SCSTPOAMonitoringTools tools have been developed]''' to monitor the implementation of the Act for [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/poa-4-spoats-2013 each case], and at the [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/poa-8-dvmc-roles-and-responsibilities district] and state levels.

Many civil society organisations (CSOs) started using this Act to provide some relief to the victims almost immediately. A few Dalit and human rights organizations took to monitoring violence against the SC&amp;ST communities, documenting them, publicizing them and also monitoring the use of the Act in dealing with these crimes. One of the first to monitor the implementation of this Act was [http://www.sakshiap.org/ Sakshi] in Andhra Pradesh. However, that was restricted to monitoring up to the judicial process—up to the filing of the First Information Report (FIR) in the police station. Special attention was given to ensure that the filing of the First Information Report (FIR) included sections of the POA.

The full monitoring of the Act by CSOs is a later phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;The full monitoring of the Act is virtually a 'systems audit' that, in addition to the police and judicial process, includes the monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports, compliance regarding prevention, rehabilitation, performance reviews, quarterly district vigilance and monitoring committee (DVMC) meetings and half yearly state vigilance and monitoring committee (SVMC) meetings.&lt;/ref&gt; and has not matured in that civil society reports on implementation of the Act (shadow reports to the ones mandated by the Act section 21(4)) are yet to be done.

Annual reports by Citizen's monitoring committees have been done in Karnataka for 2009 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044328/http://openspace.org.in/files/Implementation%20of%20POA%20in%20Karnataka%20report%202010.pdf English]), 2010 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044147/http://openspace.org.in/files/2011%20Karnataka%20SCST%20POA%20Act%20monitoring.pdf English] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044344/http://openspace.org.in/files/2011%20Karnataka%20SCST%20POA%20Act%20monitoring_kan_final.pdf Kannada]) and a combined report for 2011 and 2012 (in [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/scst-poa-implementation-in-karnataka-status-report-2013 English] and [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/scst-poa-implementation-in-karnataka-status-report-2013-kannada Kannada(with monitoring tools)]) auditing the performance of the State, including the bureaucracy, judicial system, police and monitoring mechanisms (DVMCs and SVMC). However, atrocities in the state still continue to rise, and convictions remain low.

=== Filing PILs for implementation ===
Some organizations also used the provisions of the Public Interest Litigations (PIL) to demand better implementation under the Act at High Court level and [http://ncdhr.org.in National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR)] in the Supreme Court of India.

=== National coalition to strengthen the Act ===
On the 20th anniversary of its enactment, CSOs came together from across the country to review its implementation and formed the National Coalition for Strengthening SC &amp; ST Prevention of Atrocities Act with Dr. Sirivella Prasad (who moved to the Congress Party SC Cell in 2014) as its National Convener. This took stock of the implementation of the Act in a "report card"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdhr.org.in/latestinterventions/Report%20Card%20Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, analysed the lacunae and suggested a set of amendments for improving the implementation. State specific "fact sheets" were also made available for Madhya Pradesh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openspace.org.in/files/MP%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044448/http://openspace.org.in/files/MP%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bihar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openspace.org.in/files/Bihar%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426044504/http://openspace.org.in/files/Bihar%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many important areas such as social and economic boycotts, causing hurt, destruction of property, defining the SC communities to include those who profess a religion other than Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and better monitoring mechanisms were identified.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

=== Continuous monitoring ===
Many organisations continue to monitor the implementation of the Act, and bring out state level reports.

== SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Ordinance 2014 (No 1 of 2014) ==
The [http://www.slideshare.net/OpenSpace/poaord2014 Amendment Ordinance 2014] was signed by the president on 4 March 2014 and came into force immediately. Since it was an ordinance, and was not ratified by (the next) parliament within six (6) months it lapsed. It was then referred back to the cabinet.

The key features of the ordinance are
# Addition of following new category of offences to the existing 19 punishable offences. In addition to the 19 offences listed in the Act, following new offences proposed. To cite a few: tonsuring of head, moustache, or similar acts which are derogatory to the dignity of Dalits and Adivasis; garlanding with chappals; denying access to irrigation facilities or forest rights ; dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, or to dig graves; using or permitting manual scavenging; dedicating Dalit women as devadasi; abusing in caste name; perpetrating witchcraft atrocities; imposing social or economic boycott; preventing Dalit and Adivasi candidates filing of nomination to contest elections; hurting the modesty of Dalit/Adivasi woman by removing her garments; forcing to leave house, village or residence; defiling objects sacred to SCs and STs; touching a women or uses words, acts or gestures of a sexual nature against women.
# Addition of IPC offences attracting committed against Dalits or Adivasis as punishable offences under the POA Act. Presently, only those offences listed in IPC as attracting punishment of 10 years or more and committed on Dalits/ Adivasis are accepted as offences falling under the POA Act. A number of commonly committed offences (hurt, grievous hurt, intimidation, kidnapping etc.) are excluded from the Act. This provides loopholes for the perpetrators of crime to escape from being punished for these commonly committed crimes. Therefore, a Schedule of list of IPC offences is provided in the amended act.
# Establishment of Exclusive Special Courts and Special Public Prosecutors to exclusively try the offences falling under the POA Act to enable speedy and expeditious disposal of cases. Presently, Special Courts and Public Prosecutors also deal with other cases besides atrocity cases. Consequently, cases are kept pending for long time. Thus victims are denied justice or speedy justice. Establishment of an Exclusive Special Court for one or more districts and Exclusive Public Prosecutor is proposed;
# Power of Exclusive Courts to take cognizance of offence and completion of trial in 2 months. Courts so established or specified shall have power to directly take cognizance of offences under this Act and the trial shall, as far as possible, be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet.
# Addition of chapter on the ‘Rights of Victims and Witnesses’. As of now, the Act recognizes a few rights of the victims and witnesses. This is insufficient. Therefore, many other essential rights are covered so as to impose duty and responsibility upon the State for making arrangements for the protection of victims, their dependants and witnesses against any kind of intimidation, coercion or inducement or violence or threats of violence.
# Defining clearly the term ‘wilful negligence’ of public servants at all levels, starting from the registration of complaint, and covering aspects of dereliction of duty under this Act. Section 4 of the present Act does not clearly define what constitutes ‘wilful negligence’ of public servants. Hence, ‘wilful negligence’ is defined by listing specific transgressions of law: for example, police officers not putting down accurately in writing the victim’s complaint; not reading out to the victims what has been recorded prior to getting their signature; not registering FIR under the Act; not registering it under appropriate sections of the Act; etc.
# Addition of presumption to the offences –If the accused was acquainted with the victim or his family, the court will presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim unless proved otherwise.

== SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill 2014 ==
The bill was introduced in parliament on 7 July 2014 and referred to the standing committee on 17 July 2014. Subsequently it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 4 August 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/lok-sabha-passes-sc/st-bill_1641675.html) Zee News, 4 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and then by the Rajya Sabha in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Hindu |title=Centre notifies rules for amended SC/ST Act |date=24 April 2016 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Centre-notifies-rules-for-amended-SCST-Act/article14253691.ece |accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is virtually the same as the ordinance, with a few changes to improve efficiency.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In [[law]], '''set-off''' or '''netting''' are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities, replacing gross positions with net positions.&lt;ref&gt;David Southern ''Set off revisited'' (1994) NJL 1412, 1412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd v Westminster Bank Ltd'' [1970] 3 All ER 473 at 488, per Buckley LJ&lt;/ref&gt; It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a [[plaintiff]] and a [[respondent]]. The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, ''Financial Law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), p264&lt;/ref&gt; The net claim is known as a '''[[Financial law|net position]]'''. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor.  In bookkeeping terms, set-offs are also known as reconciliations.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  To determine a set-off, simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger. 

Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off. The power of net positions is to reduce [[credit risk|credit exposure]], also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to [[market stability]]. In regard to the financial market, net positions are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, ''Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between Set off and Netting==
Whilst '''netting''' and '''set off''' are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between ''netting'', which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a ''set off''. By contrast ''set off'' describes the legal bases for producing net positions. ''Netting'' describes the form such as '''novation netting''', or '''close-out netting''', whilst ''set off'' describes judicially recognised grounds such as '''independent set off''' or '''insolvency set off'''. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk.

===Mutuality===
The law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency.

==Market Effect==
The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Milman ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (2016, Cambridge University Press, Third edition)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Netting==
At least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.worldbank.org/finance/assets/images/Woltjer_paper.pdf |title=Risk Management in Netting schemes for settlement of securities transactions |publisher=World Bank |date=March 2002 |author=Jan Woltjer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, [[financial risk|risk]]
{{Quote|Since claims are a major form of property nowadays and since creditors are often also debtors to the same counterparty, the law of set off is of paramount importance in international affairs|author=P.Wood|title=''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 72}} 

===Novation Netting===
Also called '''rolling netting''', netting by [[novation]] involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims.
{{Quote|Suppose that on Monday, 'A' and 'B' enter into transaction-1, whereby A agrees to pay B £1,000,000 on Thursday. On Tuesday A and B enter into transaction-2, whereby B agrees to pay A £400,000 on Thursday. Novation netting takes effect on Tuesday to extinguish the obligations of the parties under both transaction 1 and 2, and to create in their place a new obligation on A to pay to B £600,000 on Thursday.|author=Benjamin,Joanna|title=''Financial law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), 267}}
This differs from '''settlement netting''' (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;''Commissioner for HMRC v Entin'' [2006] BCC 955 per Lightman J [21]&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]''[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to '''settlement netting''', novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations. This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due.

===Close out netting===
An effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market.&lt;ref&gt;EFMLG ''The regulation of close out netting in the new member states of the European Union'' 2005, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]]. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency. In the event of [[counterparty]] [[bankruptcy]] or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at [[market value]] or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially "cherry pick").&lt;ref&gt;ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, Section 2(1)(a)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
The key elements of close out netting are:
*default
*the accretion of the time for performance of obligations to the time of default
*conversion of non-cash obligations into debts; meaning obligations to deliver non-cash assets are converted to market price equivalents; and
*set off&lt;ref&gt;See the Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, Art 2(1)(n)&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as''repos'', forwards or options.&lt;ref&gt;ISDA master agreement&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Insolvency Rules 1986 Rule 4.90&lt;/ref&gt; The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under [[Basel II]] and other Insolvency-related matters seen in the ''Lamfalussy Report''&lt;ref&gt;European Commission,''Report from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament, Evaluation Report on the Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive'' (2002/47/EC), 2006, COM (2006) 833 final, 10&lt;/ref&gt; has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, 269&lt;/ref&gt; In England &amp; Wales, the effect of ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]'' has largely been negated by ''Part VII'' of the [[Companies Act|Company Act 1989]] which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the [[Basel_Accords|BASEL Accords]], the first set of guidelines, [[Basel_I|BASEL I]], was missing guidelines on ''netting''. [[Basel_II|BASEL II]] introduced ''netting'' guidelines.

===Settlement netting===
For [[cash]] settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions.
Obligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood, ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995),153-5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike '''close-out netting''', settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt; Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned ''British Eagle''. These are routinely included within [[derivative]] transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. 

::*''Bilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which every individual bilateral combination of participants settles its net settlement position on a bilateral basis. 

::*''Multilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which each settling participant settles its own multilateral net settlement position (typically by means of a single payment or receipt). 

==Set off==
Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ("Party A") who owed money to another ("Party B") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.

In certain jurisdictions (including the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Insolvency Act 1986]], section 323; [[Insolvency Rules 1986]], rule 4.90.&lt;/ref&gt;), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the [[insolvency]] of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;Mokal ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as an undeclared [[security interest]] that violates the principle of [[pari passu]]. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed) 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt; Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs.&lt;ref&gt;Stein v Blake [1993]; Halesowen Presswork&lt;/ref&gt; Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk is crucially. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out. Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts. Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation. 

The right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken.

===Set-off by Country===
Two primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives.

Under English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-7242 |title=Practical Law: set-off |publisher=Thompson Reuters |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Legal set-off.''' or '''Independent set-off'''&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; What is known as statutory set-off, this arises where a claim and a counterclaim in a court action are both liquidated sums or ascertained with certainty. This is wider than insolvent set-off, but the claim and cross claim must be mutual ''and'' liquidated. In such cases the court will simply set-off the amounts and award a net sum.  The two claims do not need to be intrinsically connected.
# '''Equitable set-off.''' or '''Transaction set-off''' Outside of litigation, where two mutual claims arise out of the same matter or a sufficiently closely related matter ''and'' an injustice would be done if not enforced, the claims will set off in equity.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; Both sums must be due and payable, but may be for liquidated or unliquidated sums. Unlike ''Independent set-off'', this is not self-executing
# '''Contractual Set-off''' made by express agreement. Often netting will arise through express agreement to the parties, the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] master agreement is an example of this type, which is ineffective against an insolvent party but is often used to address pre-insolveny credit risk and reduce the need for collateral.
# '''[[Banker's right to combine accounts|Banker’s set-off]].''' or '''Current Account Set-off''' Sometimes referred to as a banker's right to combine accounts, this is a special form of set-off which is implied into contractual agreements with bankers and allows banks to offset sums in one account against another account which is overdrawn from the same client.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the right cannot be exercised if one of the accounts is a loan account, or if the bank has agreed not to exercise the right, or if the bank has notice that the sums in the account are for a specific purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii |litigants=[[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd]] |year=1968 |court=UKHL |div= |num=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on trust for another party. It is said to derive from a bankers' lien, however this is misleading as it is only available where both accounts are maintained in the same capacity. Difference in currency will not prevent this right, however.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Miliangos v George Frank Ltd]]'' [1976] AC 443&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Insolvency set-off.''' It is perhaps the most expensive form of set off. Under section 323 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;ref&gt;Rule 4.90 of the [[Insolvency Rules 1986]] for companies.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person goes into [[bankruptcy]] or a company goes into [[liquidation (law)|liquidation]] mutual debts are automatically set-off. This is a mandatory operation in bilateral situations. Whether the debt is liquidated or unliquidated does not matter, and the set-off will apply to future or contingent claims if the debts are provable. Insolvency set-off operates on liquidation and administration, where the administrator gives notice of his intention to make a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Rules 14.25 and 14.25 of the Insolvency Rules 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set-off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality.

====US law set-off====
{{jargon|date=October 2017}}
See De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative 
action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its '''common-law right of set-off'''”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211)

See, e.g., United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) ("government has the same right 'which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him' " (quoting Gratiot v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759 (1841))); see also Tatelbaum v. United States, 10 Cl.Ct. 207, 210 (1986) (set-off right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11337">'''Shortwave bands''' are frequency allocations for use within the [[shortwave radio]] spectrum (the upper [[medium frequency|MF]] band and all of the [[high frequency|HF]] band). They are the primary medium for applications such as maritime communications, international broadcasting and worldwide [[amateur radio]] activity because they take advantage of [[Skywave|ionospheric skip propagation]] to send data around the world. The bands are conventionally stated in [[wavelength]], measured in metres. [[Radio propagation|Propagation]] behavior on the shortwave bands depends on the time of day, the season and the level of [[Solar cycle|solar activity]].

=={{anchor|International broadcasting bands}}International broadcast bands==

Most international broadcasters use [[amplitude modulation]] with 5&amp;nbsp;kHz steps between channels; a few use [[single sideband]] or reduced carrier single sideband modulation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.monitoringtimes.com/html/swb.html Short wave broadcast bands, retrieved 2010 Nov 19&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC), organized under the auspices of the [[International Telecommunication Union]], allocates bands for various services in periodic conferences. The most recent WRC took place in 2012.
At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for [[international broadcasting]]:

{| class="wikitable" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" style="margin-left:10px"

Daytime reception is poor in the low solar cycle, but potentially excellent when the solar cycle (generally indicated by the [[Wolf number|number of sunspots]]) is high. Nighttime reception nonexistent, except for local [[Surface wave|groundwave]] propagation. [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] has proposed that this band be used for local digital shortwave broadcasts, testing the concept in [[Mexico City]] in [[2005 in radio|2005]]. [[Citizens band radio|Citizens Band]] allocation in most countries, is slightly higher in frequency than the broadcasting 11m band.  There are reports of pirate CB radio users operating equipment on frequencies as low as 25.615&amp;nbsp;MHz.  In the United States, this band is also shared with Remote Pickup Units (RPUs), from 25.87 to 26.1&amp;nbsp;MHz in FM mode.  
|}

==Amateur HF bands==
{{main|Amateur radio bands}}
Amateur radio operators in many countries are allocated several shortwave bands for private, non-commercial use. [[Amateur radio]] is a communications service, educational tool and hobby. It is particularly useful in providing emergency communication where standard telecommunications infrastructure is compromised or nonexistent, such as a disaster area or remote region of the globe.

==Marine, air, land mobile and fixed allocations==
Designated bands in the shortwave spectrum are used for ships, aircraft, and land vehicles. Shortwave (HF radio) is used by transoceanic aircraft for communications with air-traffic control centers out of [[Radio propagation|VHF radio range]].
Most countries with HF [[Citizens band radio|citizens'-band]] allocations use 40 or 80 channels between approximately 26.5&amp;nbsp;MHz and 27.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps.

Due to antenna-length requirements and the band's long-distance propagation characteristics (undesirable in these cases), much [[Land Mobile Radio System|land-mobile radio]] activity has moved to [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and most cordless-phone use is at UHF or higher. Some segments of the HF spectrum are allocated for fixed services, providing point-to-point communication between sites with no access to wired communications.

Illegal "freeband" CB activity can be heard from 25 to 28&amp;nbsp;MHz,steps with operators generally using AM below 26.965 (US and European CB channel 1) and SSB above 27.405 (US and European CB channel 40). [[27 MHz CB27/81 Bandplan|CB radio in the UK]] can be heard from 27.60125 to 27.99125&amp;nbsp;MHz in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps as well as the lower 26.965 to 27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz allocation.  

The UK and Ireland both operate Community Audio Distribution (CADS) in the UK or [[Wireless Public Address System]] (WPAS) in Ireland  services in the 27.600 to 27.995&amp;nbsp;MHz portion, AM and FM mode, with two overlapping sets of 40 channels (27.60125 to 27.99125&amp;nbsp;MHz in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps, and 27.605 to 27.995&amp;nbsp;MHz in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps).&lt;ref&gt;http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/cads_scheme/statement/statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  These transmissions are usually rebroadcasts of church services and can sometimes be heard hundreds or even thousands of km (miles). Part of the 11&amp;nbsp;m/27&amp;nbsp;MHz band was also allocated in many countries for early-model [[cordless phone]]s.

== {{anchor|Military HF allocation}}Military HF use ==

In the US and Canada, as well as the Americas (ITU Region 2) as a whole, there are no pre-designated HF allocations for military use.
Similar rules exist in Europe, where it has become necessary for European amateurs to police the bands due to overcrowding. Most military HF band incursions into the HF ham bands occur in Europe or Africa. Since the end of the [[Cold War]] specific military HF allocations have gradually disappeared from the HF bands, except for Africa and some parts of Asia. In Australia, the military shares the HF bands with civilian users; this is mainly due to low population density and relative under-use of the HF bands. The military in the Americas and Australia has tended to use the civilian fixed, maritime mobile and aeronautical mobile allocations on an ''ad hoc'' (non-interference) basis.

== Industrial/Scientific/Medical (ISM) and other HF allocations ==
{{See also|ISM band}}
Above 10&amp;nbsp;MHz there are numerous frequencies set aside for [[radio astronomy]], space research (FCC terminology) and standard- frequency-and-time services. RF [[diathermy]] equipment uses 27.12&amp;nbsp;MHz to heat bulk materials or adhesives for the purpose of drying or improving [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]. The industrial use of the frequency suggested the use of the 11&amp;nbsp;m band for CB radio. About a dozen narrow ("sliver") allocations for ISM exist throughout the radio spectrum. These allocations are among the smallest in the HF band, with respect to national HF allocations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10858">The '''Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' was created as part of the [[Lomé Peace Accord]], signed on July 7, 1999, which ended the 11 year [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] conflict in [[Sierra Leone]]. This accord was signed by then President [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, and the leader of the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) [[Foday Sankoh]]. The aims of the Commission were to establish "an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law related to the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from the beginning of the Conflict in 1991 to the signing of the [[Lomé Peace Accord|Lomé Peace Agreement]]; to address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/TRCDocuments.html|title=Sierra Leone Web - Truth and Reconciliation Commission|website=www.sierra-leone.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was chaired by Bishop [[Joseph Christian Humper]]. It operated from 2002-2004, with a final report being presented to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on October 5, 2004.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History of the Conflict ==
The [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] began on March 23, 1991. The [[Revolutionary United Front]], supported by the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]], attempted to overthrow the [[Joseph Saidu Momoh|Joseph Momoh]] government. This attempt resulted in a civil war that lasted 11 years, leaving over 50,000 dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Commissioners ==
* Bishop Christian Humor - Chairman
* Hon. Justice Laura Marcus-Jones - Deputy Chairperson
* Professor [[William Schabas]]
* Ms. Yasmin Louise Sooka
* Mr. Sylvanus Torto
* Madam Ajaratu Satang Jow
* Professor John Kamara

== Mandate ==
The commission's mandate was to "provide a degree of accountability for human rights abuses committed during the conflict."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Below is a brief summary of its mandate.
* To construct an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights during the armed conflict in Sierra Leone.
* To address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation, and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered.
* To investigate and report on the causes, nature, and extent of violations and abuses to the highest possible degree in order to determine a proper course of action for reconciliation purposes.
* To help restore the dignity of the victims, and to provide an opportunity for healing and reconciliation between the victims and those who carried out the abuses.
The commission also strove to give special attention to victims of sexual abuse and to children who were either victims or perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions|last=Hayner|first=Priscilla|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-80635-0|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
A major task of Sierra Leone's Truth Commission was to interview victims on both sides of the conflict and report on what they found. The commission reported a number of findings, including: 
* The conflict and post-independence period preceding it represent the most shameful years of Sierra Leone’s history. This conflict reflects an extraordinary failure of leadership individuals amongst the government, society, and public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption, and nepotism that deprived the nation of its dignity and reduced its citizens to a state of poverty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Government accountability was non-existent, and the institution designed to uphold human rights was co-opted by the executive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Both sides of the conflict specifically targeted civilians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The Sierra Leone civil war was characterized by indiscriminate violence. It broke long-standing rules, defiled cherished traditions, sullied human respect and tore apart the very fabric of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Children aged between ten and 14 years were especially targeted for forced recruitment. Girls between the ages of ten and 14 were targeted for rape and for abuse as sexual slaves. These women were also tortured and suffered cruel and inhumane acts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The leadership of the Revolutionary United Front and the Government of Sierra Leone are responsible for either authorising or instigating human rights violations against civilians. They also stand accused of failing to stop such atrocities, and for failing to acknowledge the occurrence of these atrocities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Contrary to popular belief, the exploitation of diamonds did not cause the conflict in Sierra Leone. However, various factions targeted diamondiferous areas in order to gain wealth to support their war efforts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The [[right to the truth]] is inalienable. This right should be upheld in terms of national and international law. It is the reaching of the wider truth through broad-based participation that permits a nation to examine itself honestly and to take effective measures to prevent a repetition of the past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
For a complete list of the Truth Commission's findings, see chapter 2 of the full report, available [http://www.sierra-leone.org/Other-Conflict/TRCVolume2.pdf here].

== Reparations ==
The [[Reparations (transitional justice)|Reparations]] section of the Truth Commission is aimed at creating a [[Reparative justice|reparations program]] for the victims of the Sierra Leonean conflict. Such a program is difficult to create as there are a number of victims on both sides of the conflict, as well as a number of different crimes committed by both sides. Because of this, the Commission had to determine who would benefit from a reparations program.&lt;blockquote&gt;In designing a reparations programme for the victims of the Sierra Leonean conflict, the Commission had to take into account a number of factors. It would have been gratifying if all victims of the conflict could benefit from a reparations programme but such a programme would be totally impossible for the country to implement. The Commission therefore had to determine who would benefit from a reparations programme. The Commission determined the category of beneficiaries by considering those victims who were particularly vulnerable because of the human rights violations they had suffered and the harm that they continued to live with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is important to note that the TRC Act did not explicitly use the term "reparations". Instead, they were instructed to "address the needs of the victims," and restore the human dignity of victims" as well as "promote healing and reconciliation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act of 2000 requires any commission to make recommendations concerning the reforms and measures needed to achieve the object of the commission. These recommendations are crucial in order to promote the healing process for the nation after the conflict. In the case of the Sierra Leone commission, the reparations are aimed at the "building of a new Sierra Leone based on the values of human dignity, tolerance and respect for the rights of all persons."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main recommendations of the commission were: 
* The commission found that due to a lack of visionary leadership, there was no one to steer the country away from its slide into chaos and civil war. Because of this, the commission called on leaders from all levels of Sierra Leonean society to commit themselves to employing better forms of leadership.
* The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption and nepotism, which deprived the nation of its dignity and forced its citizens into poverty. The commission calls upon all members in the private sector to work together and usher in a new culture of ethics and to fight the "scourge of corruption which saps the life-force of Sierra Leone."
* The commission also recommended the implementation of a more modern human rights culture in which all "Sierra Leoneans respect each other's human rights, without exception."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, the creation of a new constitution was also recommended. In the commission's words: "A Sierra Leone that is united around clear constitutional rights, values and principles has a promising future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Due to a severe lack of governmental accountability, democracy and the rule of law had ceased to exist. Therefore, the commission recommended that Sierra Leone must strengthen its institutions of accountability.
For a complete list of the commission's recommendations, see Chapter 2 of the full report, available [http://www.sierra-leone.org/Other-Conflict/TRCVolume2.pdf here].

== Criticisms ==
In her book ''Unspeakable Truths: Facing the Challenge of Truth Commissions,'' [[Priscilla Hayner|Priscilla B. Hayner]] examines various truth commissions, one of which is the commission for Sierra Leone. One of her main criticisms of the report was the government's inability to enact many of the commission's recommendations. The "government was required to submit public quarterly reports on the actions it had taken to fulfill the recommendations."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government made slow but eventual progress in the implementation of the commission's recommendations.

Hayner also points out a common criticism facing many truth commissions; the need for "social forgetting". Many citizens in Sierra Leone felt that social forgetting was crucial to the process of healing and reconciliation. Unfortunately, many citizens were not able to simply forget, as they were pressured into making official statements to the commission regarding their experiences during the Civil War.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5416">'''Siviilipalvelus''', or ''civiltjänst'' ("civilian service"), is an [[alternative service]] in Finland. It is provided as an alternative to military service provided by Article 127 of the [[Finnish constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990731.pdf |title=1999 Constitution, section 127 |website=finlex.fi |access-date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[conscientious objector]]s. The service length is 347 days,&lt;ref name="fl"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2007/en20071446.pdf |title=Siviilipalveluslaki (Non-Military Service Act) §4, 1446/2007 |year=2013 |website=finlex.fi |language=fi |access-date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed from 395 days in 2008 (does not apply retroactively). It can be entered into by filing paperwork indicating that one has ethical or religious objections to military service.

==History==
This alternative service option has existed since 1931 thanks to the efforts of conscientious objector [[Arndt Pekurinen]], although non-religious objections were not allowed until a change of law in 1959. Until 1987, non-religious objections were examined by a Special Commission of Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uskonnonvapaus.fi/hakusanat/siviilipalvelus.html |title=Siviilipalvelus - Hakusanat uskonnonvapaudesta |work=uskonnonvapaus.fi |year=2011 |accessdate=14 May 2013|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was composed of a judge, a military officer, a representative of the social ministry, and a psychiatrist. Today, simply filing the correct paperwork suffices, and as such, many people opt for it simply as an alternative to military service while not having any special objections. An emergency state (in case of war, for example) still allows the usage of Special Commissions of Inquiry.

== Completing service ==
=== Applying ===
Alternative service can be entered into using a form. This form is submitted before service or during military service. If it is submitted during military service, the person must be released from doing military service at once. A community service location for the remaining 11 months should be chosen before entering alternative service for maximum choice. If a suitable location is not found, one will be assigned by the educational centre.&lt;ref name="sk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sivarikeskus.fi/tietoa.php |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526130336/http://www.sivarikeskus.fi/tietoa.php |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Starting service ===
''Siviilipalvelus'' begins with a one-month training period at the ''Siviilipalveluskeskus'' ([[Lapinjärvi Educational Center]]) in Lapinjärvi and continues with approximately 11 months of work duties at an approved non-profit organization or ministry or other government entity. A person cannot perform this service for a political party or trade union or a location from which they are earning income.&lt;ref name="sk" /&gt;

=== Benefits ===
''Siviilipalveluskeskus'' provides for housing and food during the training-period. 

Housing arrangements are paid or arranged for during work duties by either [[Kela (Finnish)|KELA]] or the entity where the person is performing their service.

The entity is responsible for paying a food allowance (or providing meals on-site) and daily allowance money to the person performing their service.

18 personal vacation days are provided by law, in addition to 20 days performance vacation days (''kuntoisuusloma'') may be provided at the entity's discretion. Generally three performance vacation days are given during the training period if an entity where service can be performed has been located beforehand. If needed, 12 days of paternity leave can be provided.

=== Interruption ===
A person may request up to 180 days of personal leave (''HSL-loma''), but this is not counted into the service period. This is generally granted on a case per case basis.

A person may also be either freed or deferred for three years on medical grounds (C or E class).

=== Discipline ===
If a person completing alternative service does not perform their work duties, the following consequences may occur:&lt;ref name="sk" /&gt;
#Written warning
#Extension of work duties (at most 4 hours during 5 days)
#Loss of daily allowance money (at most twice, for 30 days maximum)
#Loss of personal holidays (at most 4 days per time)
A repeated offense will result in a prison sentence equal in length to half of the remaining service time.&lt;ref name="fl" /&gt; This, however, is not marked on a person's criminal record.&lt;ref name="just"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oikeus.fi/oikeusrekisterikeskus/18593.htm |title=Oikeusrekisterikeskus - Criminal records |work=oikeus.fi |year=2013 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service and for-profit work ===
A person undergoing ''siviilipalvelus'' is fully permitted to be employed in a company while doing service, but he/she may not engage in both ''siviilipalvelus'' and for-profit work at the same company/entity. For-profit work is restricted to free time from ''siviilipalvelus''. Finnish law forbids companies from firing employees merely because they have started ''siviilipalvelus'', although it does not force companies to renew fixed-term contracts, which is a common occurrence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">The '''Sochi agreement''' (also known as the ''Dagomys Agreements'' ({{lang-ru|Дагомысские соглашения}}), official name in Russian: «Cоглашение о принципах мирного урегулирования грузино-осетинского конфликта») was a [[ceasefire]] agreement ostensibly marking the end of both the [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict|Georgian–Ossetian]] and [[Georgian–Abkhazian conflict]]s, signed in [[Sochi]] on June 24, 1992 between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]], the ceasefire with [[Abkhazia]] on July 27, 1993.

== South Ossetia agreement ==
{{further|Georgian–Ossetian conflict}}
Russia brokered a ceasefire and negotiated the Agreement in 1992. The agreement primarily established a cease-fire between both the Georgian and South Ossetian forces, but it also defined a zone of conflict around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and established a security corridor along the border of the as yet unrecognized South Ossetian territories. The Agreement also created a Joint Control Commission and a peacekeeping body, the Joint Peacekeeping Forces group (JPKF). The JPKF was put under Russian command and was composed of peacekeepers from Georgia, [[Russia]], and [[North Ossetia]] (as the separatist South Ossetian government was still unrecognized; South Ossetian peacekeepers, however, served in the North Ossetian contingent). In addition, the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) did agree to monitor the ceasefire and to facilitate negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Ossetia | work =Freedom House: Freedom in the World | publisher =Freedom House | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/south-ossetia | accessdate = 2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sammut | first =Dennis | last2 =Cvetkovski | first2 =Nikola | title =Confidence Building Matters: The Georgia-South Ossetia Conflict | publisher =Verification Technology Information Centre |date=March 2006| location =London, UK | pages =14 | url =http://www.vertic.org/media/Archived_Publications/Matters/Confidence_Building_Matters_No6.pdf | isbn =1-899548-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE sought to eliminate sources of tension, support the existing ceasefire, and facilitate a broader political framework to alleviate long term disharmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author =Personal Representative of the CSCE Chairman-in-Office for Georgia | title =17-CSO/Journal No. 2, Annex 2 | work = Seventeenth CSO Meeting, Annex 2 | publisher =The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe |date=November 1992| url = http://www.osce.org/georgia-closed/22213 | accessdate = 2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloed1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arie Bloed|title=The Conference on Security and Co-Operation in Europe: Analysis and Basic Documents, 1972–1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fjt6bYgEFMC&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=2013-11-05|year=1993|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-0-7923-2593-2|pages=976–978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abkhazia agreement ==
{{further|War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)}}
Once again, a Russian brokered agreement in 1993, the '''Agreement on a ceasefire in Abkhazia and On a Mechanism To Ensure Its Observance''', allowed for a moratorium on the use of force, the withdrawal of conflicting parties from the warzone within fifteen days, establishing a Russian-Georgian-Abkhaz control group to monitor the ceasefire, the return of the [[People's Assembly of Abkhazia|Abkhazian parliament]] to [[Sukhumi]], the placement of [[UN]] observers in the territory, and the resumption of talks to settle the dispute. In August of the same year [[UNOMIG]] was put in place as the UN monitoring force. The truce was violated on September 27 as Abkhaz forces seized Sukhumi and declared victory. The pro-Georgian forces then withdrew to [[Tbilisi]], as Georgia joined the CIS and changed Russia's stance towards Georgia's on the matter.

A further [[Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces]], also known as the 1994 Moscow Agreement, was agreed the following year.

Once again, on March 6–7, 2003, [[Georgian President]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze|Eduard Sheverdnadze]] and [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] signed another agreement that sought to include economic rehabilitation, resumption of rail networks, and the attraction of international investment. This would happen to turn into a disappointment, especially for the Georgians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Abkhazia: Statement by the National Security Council of Georgia (S/2003/569)  | work =reliefweb: Updates (Report from the UN Security Council) | publisher =ReliefWeb | date =2003-05-23 | url =http://reliefweb.int/report/georgia/abkhazia-statement-national-security-council-georgia-s2003569 | accessdate = 2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =S/Res/1494 (2003) | work = United Nations Security Council | publisher =United Nations | date =2003-07-30 | url =https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1494(2003) | accessdate = 2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Sochi summits ==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 7 March 2003-1.jpg|thumb|Then [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] meeting with then [[President of Georgia]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and then [[Prime Minister of Abkhazia]] [[Gennady Gagulia]] in [[Sochi]] on 7 March 2003.]]
In 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Georgian President Shevardnadze and Abkhazian PM Gennady Gagulia and set in motion a Sochi process that sought to create a Georgian-Russian-Abkhaz working groups on [[confidence building measures]]'s (CBM). The parties sought to make it easier for the return of refugees and [[economic reconstruction]]. The Sochi process signified a regress from the multilateral to a bilateral format that left Georgia on its own to face Russia and the Abkhaz. It also was seen to undermine Georgia's argument that the Geneva process was the sole format for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.&lt;ref name="jamestown1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Socor |first=Vladimir |url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368481 |title=Eurasia Daily Monitor &amp;#124; The Jamestown Foundation |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019100107/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368481 |archivedate=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Russia were seen to violate the agreement as a Russian company begun maintenance work on the Sochi-Sukhumi railroad, which was legally Georgian, though controlled by Russia and the Abkhaz. The move was seen as a violation whereby restoration could only proceed in parallel with the safe return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia beginning with the Gali district. However, there had been no progress on the return of refugees, and so, unilateral Russian actions on the railroad violated the Sochi agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Socor |first=Vladimir |url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368350 |title=Eurasia Daily Monitor &amp;#124; The Jamestown Foundation |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;-- &lt;ref name="jamestown1" /&gt; dead--&gt;However, there had been no progress on the return of refugees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Socor |first=Vladimir |url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368350 |title=Eurasia Daily Monitor &amp;#124; The Jamestown Foundation |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019093151/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368350 |archivedate=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dead--&gt;

In 2008, [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] and Putin made a last-ditch attempt as incumbent presidents to resolve a protracted dispute over European missile defenses at anotjer Sochi summit. This followed Russian officials objecting to U.S. plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses (BMD) in Poland and the Czech Republic. They had claim that the stated American justification for the BMD deployments—that the systems are needed to defend the United States and European countries against an emerging Iranian missile threat—lacked credibility. Instead, they insisted the true objective of such moves along Russia's periphery was to weaken Russia's nuclear deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=1904 |title=WPR Article &amp;#124; Sochi Summit Fails to Solve U.S.-Russian Missile Defense Dispute |publisher=Worldpoliticsreview.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Somalia]] on 20 June 1961 to vote on the new constitution for the [[Somali Republic|country created the previous year]] by the union of [[British Somaliland]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. It was approved by 90.56% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/so.html Elections in Somalia] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Somaliland]] region the [[Somali National League]] (SNL) party encouraged a boycott of the referendum, and 60% of the approximately 100,000 votes from Somaliland opposed the constitution. However the south of the country had 1,952,660 voters, effectively giving the south the power of veto, and obfuscated the fact there was no popular mandate for a union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poore|first=Brad|title=Somaliland: Shackled to a Failed State|journal=Stanford Journal of International Law|volume=(45) 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Alchemy of Race and Rights: Diary of a Law Professor''''' is a [[memoir]] and [[critical legal studies]] text by [[Patricia J. Williams]].

==Publication==
Williams published ''The Alchemy of Race and Rights'' with [[Harvard University Press]] in 1991. A paperback edition was published in March 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alchemy of Race and Rights — Patricia J.

==Subject matter==
Writing in 1998, [[The New York Times]] said that in ''The Alchemy of Race and Rights'', Williams "used autobiography to explore the relationship among law, race, perceptions of rights and liberation."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kalman|first1=Laura|title=Race Matters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/10/books/race-matters.html|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Washington Post]] described the book as "targeting the legal mind, particularly its intersections with matters of race and gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Streitfeld|first1=David|title=FOCUS|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/16/focus/91a32ef0-e652-42c9-a5a5-7216ed9d9ef2/|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Washington Post|date=August 16, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Reviews===

'''''Theory of Legal Norms''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Teoria della Norma Giuridica'') is a book, published in 1958, by the [[Italia]]n [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of [[philosophy of law|foundations of law]] &amp;mdash; the legal norm.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=87|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in six chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Law as behavior rule: he shows three theories that lead, according to him, to a unique, non-paradoxical concept system: ''regulational'', ''intersubjective'' and ''institutional''.
# Discusses the two main schools of legal theory: [[legal positivism]] and theories of [[natural law]].
# Approaches the norm in its formal aspect, analyzing ''propositions'', ''prescriptions'', ''expressions'', ''imperatives'', ''commands'' and ''advices''.
# Discusses imperatives specifically, as well as their relationship with [[value judgement]]s, ''permissions'' and the addressees of a norm.
# ''Sanctions'' of norms (prescribed consequences of their violation); the necessity of sanctions to characterize a norm.
# Classifications of norms and the ''[[sine qua non]]'' character of ''[[generalization]]-[[abstraction]]''.

== Criticism ==
"In this book, Bobbio defends a ''positive'' philosophy committed to the scientific soul and against [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] points of view. Bobbio breaks from jusnaturalists tendencies, considering law as a speech to be submitted to the [[language]] analysis, inside the borderlines of a scientific theory, according to the paradigm of the [[logical positivism]]"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/1708639-teoria-da-norma-jur%C3%ADdica/|title=Teoria da Norma Jurídica|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio presents his position about ''sanctions''. According to him, sanction is the response to violation of a law. Analyzing sanction under the point of view of efficacy, the relation between law and force appears. For [[Kelsen]], law exists to regulate force. For Bobbio, sanctions are means to obtain the ''desirable human behavior''. Bobbio emphasizes the positive sanctions (awards) in opposition to repressive ones."&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciashumanas.com.br/resumo_artigo_7097/artigo_sobre_o_pensamento_jur%C3%8Ddico_de_norberto_bobbio|title=O Pensamento Jurídico de Norberto Bobbio|publisher=Ciências Humanas.coml.br|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this book, Bobbio analyzes the ''law as rule of behavior'', showing a general view  and a criticism of the various theories that intend to reveal the concept of law, concluding that, although all the theories are integrated,  the normativist one prevails in sense of constituting pressuposed of validity for the other ones"&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/513/492|title=Bobbio, Norberto.

'''Trompenaars' model of national culture differences''' is a framework for [[cross-cultural communication]] applied to general business and management, developed by [[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Trompenaars, F., Hampden-Turner, C. (1997) ''Riding the Waves of Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1996) "Riding the waves of commerce: a test of Trompenaars' "model" of national culture differences", in: ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'' 20(2): p. 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt; This involved a large-scale survey of 8,841 managers and organization employees from 43 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Peter B.|last2=Dugan|first2=Shaun|last3=Trompenaars|first3=Fons|title=National culture and the values of organizational employees: A dimensional analysis across 43 nations|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/27/2/231.short|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model of national culture differences has seven dimensions. There are five orientations covering the ways in which human beings deal with each other, one which deals with time, and one which deals with the environment.

*'''Universalism vs. Particularism'''
Universalism is the belief that ideas and practices can be applied everywhere without modification, while particularism is the belief that circumstances dictate how ideas and practices should be applied. It asks the question, ''What is more important, rules or relationships?'' Cultures with high universalism see one reality and focus on formal rules. Business meetings are characterized by rational, professional arguments with a "get down to business" attitude. Trompenaars research found there was high universalism in countries like the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, and Sweden. Cultures with high particularism see reality as more subjective and place a greater emphasis on relationships.  It is important to get to know the people one is doing business with during meetings in a particularist environment.  Someone from a universalist culture would be wise not to dismiss personal meanderings as irrelevancies or mere small talk during such business meetings.  Countries that have high particularism include Venezuela, Indonesia, China, South Korea, and the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=123–125|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Individualism vs. Communitarianism'''  
Individualism refers to people regarding themselves as individuals, while communitarianism refers to people regarding themselves as part of a group. Trompenaars research yielded some interesting results and suggested that cultures may change more quickly that many people realize. It may not be surprising to see a country like the United States with high individualism, but Mexico and the former communist countries of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were also found to be individualistic in Trompenaars research. In Mexico, the shift from a previously communitarian culture could be explained with its membership in NAFTA and involvement in the global economy. This contrasts with [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Hofstede's]] earlier research, which found these countries to be collectivist, and shows the dynamic and complex nature of culture.  Countries with high communitarianism include Germany, China, France, Japan, and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=125–126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neutral vs. Emotional''' 
A neutral culture is a culture in which emotions are held in check whereas an emotional culture is a culture in which emotions are expressed openly and naturally.  Neutral cultures that come rapidly to mind are those of the Japanese and British.  Some examples of high emotional cultures are the Netherlands, Mexico, Italy, Israel and Spain. In emotional cultures, people often smile, talk loudly when excited, and greet each other with enthusiasm. So, when people from neutral culture are doing business in an emotional culture they should be ready for a potentially animated and boisterous meeting and should try to respond warmly.  As for those from an emotional culture doing business in a neutral culture, they should not be put off by a lack of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: Culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Specific vs. Diffuse'''
A specific culture is one in which individuals have a large public space they readily share with others and small private space guard closely and share with only close friends and associates. A diffuse culture is one in which public space and private space are similar in size and individuals guard their public space carefully, because entry into public space affords entry into private space as well. It looks at how separate a culture keeps their personal and public lives. [[Fred Luthans]] and Jonathan Doh give the following example which explains this:

''An example of these specific and diffuse cultural dimensions is provided by the United States and Germany. A U.S. professor, such as Robert Smith, PhD, generally would be called “Doctor Smith” by students when at his U.S. university. When shopping, however, he might be referred to by the store clerk as “Bob,” and he might even ask the clerk’s advice regarding some of his intended purchases. When golfing, Bob might just be one of the guys, even to a golf partner who happens to be a graduate student in his department. The reason for these changes in status is that, with the specific U.S. cultural values, people have large public spaces and often conduct themselves differently depending on their public role. At the same time, however, Bob has private space that is off-limits to the students who must call him “Doctor Smith” in class. In high-diffuse cultures, on the other hand, a person’s public life and private life often are similar. Therefore, in Germany, Herr Professor Doktor Schmidt would be referred to that way at the university, local market, and bowling alley—and even his wife might address him formally in public. A great deal of formality is maintained, often giving the impression that Germans are stuffy or aloof.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=/new York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=126–127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2014/05/one-reason-cross-cultural-small-talk-is-so-tricky|title=One Reason Cross-Cultural Small Talk Is So Tricky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://x-culture.org/peach-vs-coconut-cultures/|title=PEACH VS. COCONUT CULTURES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Achievement vs. Ascription''' 
In an achievement culture, people are accorded status based on how well they perform their functions. In an ascription culture, status is based on who or what a person is. Does one have to prove himself to receive status or is it given to him? Achievement cultures include the US, Austria, Israel, Switzerland and the UK. Some ascription cultures are Venezuela, Indonesia, and China. When people from an achievement culture do business in an ascription culture it is important to have older, senior members with formal titles and respect should be shown to their counterparts. However, for an ascription culture doing business in an achievement culture, it is important to bring knowledgeable members who can prove to be proficient to other group, and respect should be shown for the knowledge and information of their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
* '''Sequential vs. Synchronic'''
A sequential time culture is the one in which the people like events to happen in a chronological order. The punctuality is very appreciated and they base their lives in schedules, plannification and specific and clear deadlines; in this kind of cultures time is very important and they do not tolerate the waste of time. Instead in synchronic cultures, they see specific time periods as interwoven periods, the use to highlight the importance of punctuality and deadlines if these are key to meeting objectives and they often work in several things at a time, they are also more flexible with the distribution of time and commitments. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/convergence-divergence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Internal vs. External control''' 
Do we control our environment or are we controlled by it?

'''''Veeck v. Southern Bldg. Code Congress Int'l, Inc.''''', 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc), was a 2002 [[en banc]] 9-6 decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], about the scope of [[copyright|copyright protection]] for building codes and by implication other privately drafted [[law]]s adopted by [[state government (United States)|state]]s and [[municipal government]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int'l, Inc.'', 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 969 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  A three-fifths majority of the court's fifteen judges held that copyright protection no longer applied to model codes once they were enacted into law.

==Background==

===Factual context===

The Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) published a standard building code that it proposed as a model code for municipalities. It encourages local government entities to enact its codes into law by reference, without cost to them. The towns of [[Anna, Texas|Anna]] and [[Savoy, Texas|Savoy]] in North Texas adopted the SBCCI code as law. Peter Veeck operates a website that provides free access via the Internet to information about the area of Texas north of Dallas, including some of the area's municipal codes and ordinances. He learned that Anna and Savoy had adopted the SBCCI code and went to those towns to obtain copies of the code, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;The brief of the United States, filed after the Supreme Court called for the views of the Solicitor General on the petition for a writ of certiorari, stated: "The standard codes are generally
available to the public at local government offices and
libraries, although neither Savoy nor Anna has a public
library and there is reason to believe that finding copies
of the codes may be difficult." [https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/osg/briefs/2002/01/01/2002-0355.pet.ami.inv.pdf Brief] for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Southern Bldg. Code Cong. Int'l, Inc. v. Veeck (2003) (No. 02-355), at 3. Veek was also unsuccessful in obtaining the codes of another 20 Texas towns. ''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;
He then bought electronic copies of the codes from SBCCI. Despite the fact that the codes contained a copyright notice and warnings against copying, Veeck uploaded the codes on his website. SBCCI demanded that Veeck cease and desist from infringing its copyrights. In response, Veeck filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that he did not violate the Copyright Act. SBCCI counterclaimed for copyright infringement and other allegedly wrongful acts.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 793-94, 809-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===District court ruling===

The facts were not disputed and each party moved for summary judgment on the copyright infringement issue. The district court granted summary judgment in SBCCI's favor.&lt;ref&gt;''Veeck v. Southern Bldg. Code Congress Int'l, Inc.'', 49 F. Supp. 2d 885 (E.D. Tex., 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court began by considering the Supreme Court's 1888 decision in ''Banks v. Manchester'',&lt;ref&gt;128 U.S. 244 (1888).&lt;/ref&gt; which held that judicial opinions are not subject to copyright protection. ''Banks'' in turn rests upon two grounds neither of which, the district court said, would justify invalidation of SBCCI's copyright protection:
# the public owns the opinions because it pays the judge's salaries, and
# as a matter of public policy, the whole work done by the judges constitutes the "authentic exposition and interpretation of the law," which, binds every citizen and therefore "is free for publication to all."&lt;ref&gt;49 F. Supp. 2d at 888.&lt;/ref&gt;

These considerations do not apply here, the district court maintained, because "SBCCI is a private non-profit corporation which carries out research, compiles data, drafts standardized codes, and then prints them in a usable fashion for its customers," without payment from the public. Without copyright protection, organizations like SDCCI would be unable to continue their work. While Veeck argues that it is necessary to publish codes on the Internet to provide the public with its due process right to free access to the law, he is wrong. The fact that he purchased the codes by just ordering and paying for them shows that the public can do the same. Therefore, the court said, "''Banks'' is clearly distinguishable to the present case or scenario as stated above. Accordingly, the Court finds that SBCCI's works should be afforded their copyright protection."&lt;ref&gt;49 F. Supp. 2d at 889.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court entered a permanent injunction and ordered an award of monetary damages.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 794.&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal followed.

===The vacated panel decision===

Initially, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed, but its decision was vacated and the case was set for rehearing ''en banc''. The panel concluded (a) the incentive of copyright was needed to continue production of these useful model codes; (b) there was no evidence that Veeck had
been denied access to the town building codes; and (c) there
was no merger of idea and expression because "contrary to Veeck's insistence—there remain many ways to write model building codes, not just one."&lt;ref&gt;241 F.3d 398, 402-04, 407 (5th Cir. 2001), rev'd, 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of the Fifth Circuit==

===Majority opinion===

Judge [[Edith Jones]] began her opinion for the nine-judge majority with this summary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The issue in this ''en banc'' case is the extent to which a private organization may assert copyright protection for its model codes, after the models have been adopted by a legislative body and become "the law". Specifically, may a code-writing organization prevent a website operator from posting the text of a model code where the code is identified simply as the building code of a city that enacted the model code as law? Our short answer is that as law, the model codes enter the public domain and are not subject to the copyright holder's exclusive prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 793.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The ''law'' is excluded from copyright====

The court traced the early case law. In 1834, the Supreme Court interpreted the first federal copyright laws and unanimously held that "no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court ..."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 668 (1834).&lt;/ref&gt; The case involved a copyright infringement suit between early reporters of U.S. Supreme Court opinions, both of whom were selling editions of their reports. Peters, who had replaced Wheaton, the reporter from 1816 to 1827, decided to market a less expensive product in which he omitted Wheaton's annotations and summaries but copied the texts of the Supreme Court's opinions, both those preceding his term as reporter and those he reported himself. Wheaton found his market dried up and sued Peters for infringement. Wheaton lost in the trial court and appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment. The Court's opinion concluded: "It may be proper to remark that the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right."&lt;ref&gt;''Wheaton'', 33 U.S. at 668.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any copyright protection for publications of judicial opinions could cover only the added materials such as summaries of the opinions and commentaries on them, but not the judicially authored texts of the opinions themselves. Counsel for both parties in the case agreed that statutes could not be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;''Veeck'', 293 F.3d at 795.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the Supreme Court extended the rule of ''Wheaton v. Peters'' to state court opinions, saying that the law " is free for publication to all."&lt;ref&gt;''Banks v. Manchester'', 128 U.S. 244 (1888).&lt;/ref&gt; State courts made similar rulings for their courts and laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Veeck'', 293 F.3d at 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

SBCCI argues that the ''Banks'' case explains the rule on two grounds, both of which (SBCCI argues) are inapplicable here. First, ''Banks'' is said to deny copyright to judicial opinions because judges, whose salaries are paid by the government, cannot claim to own the opinions. Also, they do not need copyright incentives to write opinions. In contrast, SBCCI is unlike government employees, it says, and as the private "author" of model codes it allegedly depends on copyright incentives in order to perform their public service. Second, SBCCI argues that ''Banks'' in effect says that due process requires adequate public access to the law, but that argument does not apply because there is adequate public access to its building codes.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 796–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court disagreed that this is a proper reading of ''Banks''. Rather, "''Banks'' declares at the outset of its discussion that copyright law in the United States is purely a matter of statutory construction."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Banks'', 128 U.S. at 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Supreme Court denies that judges are the authors or proprietors of their opinions. What their work is " constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which, binding every citizen, is free for publication to all."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Banks'', 128 U.S. at 253–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, judicial writings are works for hire that belong to the public that pays judges' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 797. The Fifth Circuit insisted that "''Banks'' refers to the source of the judges' salary in order to explain that it is the public at large, not the judges, who have the pecuniary interest or proprietorship in the fruits of their judicial labors." ''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Banks'', read together with ''Wheaton'', on which it relies, stands for the rule that the ''law'' "is not subject to copyright."&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 798.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''law'' is not simply what a law-proposing body such as SBCCI offers to the legislature:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lawmaking bodies in this country enact rules and regulations only with the [[consent of the governed]]. The very process of lawmaking demands and incorporates contributions by "the people," in an infinite variety of individual and organizational capacities. Even when a governmental body consciously decides to enact proposed model building codes, it does so based on various legislative considerations, the sum of which produce its version of "the law." In performing their function, the lawmakers represent the public will, and the public are the final "authors" of the law.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 799.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

SBCCI is wrong about access, too, the court maintained. That law is in the public domain means that it is there "for whatever use the citizens choose to make of it. Citizens may reproduce copies of the law for many purposes, not only to guide their actions but to influence future legislation, educate their neighborhood association, or simply to amuse." The public's rights cannot be reconciled with "with the statutory right of a copyright holder to exclude his work from any publication or dissemination." SBCCI responds that "the fair use doctrine as well as its honorable intentions will prevent abuse. Free availability of the law, by this logic, has degenerated into availability as long as SBCCI chooses not to file suit." The court said it rejected that: "Instead, we read ''Banks'', ''Wheaton'', and related cases consistently to enunciate the principle that the law," whether it has its source in judicial opinions or statutes, ordinances or regulations, is not subject to federal copyright law."&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 799–800&lt;/ref&gt;

In deciding that the municipal building codes in this case
could be freely copied, the court relied on the First
Circuit's decision in ''Building Officials &amp; Code Administrators v. Code Technology, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;628 F.2d 730
(1st Cir. 1980),&lt;/ref&gt; (''BOCA'')—the only other appellate case addressing a similar enactment of a model building code. The court distinguished cases from the Ninth and Second
Circuits holding that government reference to (not copying or enactment of) a preexisting private system for identifying medical conditions and a listing of valuations for used cars did not eliminate the copyright owners' rights to prevent others from making copies of the material.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. American Med. Ass'n'', 121 F.3d 516 (1997), opinion amended by 133 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 1998); ''CCC Info. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Market Reports, Inc.'', 44 F.3d 61 (2d Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect of copyright statute====

Under the copyright statute, ''facts'' are unprotectable. Moreover, there is a merger of idea and expression once a model building code is enacted into positive law. Because there is only one way to express the meaning of the building codes, the idea embodied in the law merges with SBCCI's expression, and at that point, renders copyright protection unavailable. Under the Supreme Court's ''Feist'' decision, facts "may not be copyrighted and are part of the public domain available to every person."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.'', 499 U.S. 340, 348 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; SBCCI argues that this "ignores the goal of fostering competition in creativity." It also argues that no merger occurs here "because there are many possible ways to express model codes: both the multiplicity of building standards and the variety of ways to express those standards compel the conclusion that the ideas have not merged with their expression." The court replied that the argument misses the point: Once the law is enacted, it cannot be expressed authoritatively any way except verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 801-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court also rejected the "takings" argument: "This is not, however, a 'takings' case, not least because SBCCI urged localities to adopt its model codes. The issue in the case is .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. the legal consequences flowing from the permission that SBCCI gave."&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 803.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Model codes versus standards====

Several standard-setting organizations filed ''amicus curiae'' briefs "out of fear that their copyrights may be vitiated simply by the common practice of governmental entities' incorporating their standards in laws and regulations."&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 803–04.&lt;/ref&gt; The court sought to reassure them: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This case does not involve references to extrinsic standards. Instead, it concerns the wholesale adoption of a model code promoted by its author, SBCCI, precisely for use as legislation. Caselaw that derives from official incorporation of extrinsic standards is distinguishable in reasoning and result.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 804.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court pointed out that such organizations as the American Medical Association that had promulgated standards that government agencies later referred to in regulations had not:

&lt;blockquote&gt;solicited incorporation of their standards by legislators or regulators. In the case of a model code, on the other hand, the text of the model serves no other purpose than to become law. SBCCI operates with the sole motive and purpose of creating codes that will become obligatory in law.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 805.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Other policy arguments ====

SBCCI pleaded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;without full copyright protection for model codes, despite their enactment as the law in hundreds or thousands of jurisdictions, SBCCI will lack the revenue to continue its public service of code drafting. Thus SBCCI needs copyright's economic incentives.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 805.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court had several responses. First, it did not believe SBCCI, since it "has survived and grown over 60 years" without court copyright protection. Second, "the most fruitful approach for the public entities and the potentially regulated industries lies in mutual cooperation. The self-interest of the builders, engineers, designers and other relevant tradesmen should also not be overlooked in the calculus." Third:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]f SBCCI wants to enhance the market value of its model codes, SBCCI could easily publish them as do the compilers of statutes and judicial opinions, with "value-added" in the form of commentary, questions and answers, lists of adopting jurisdictions and other information valuable to a reader. The organization could also charge fees for the massive amount of interpretive information about the codes that it doles out.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 806.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court therefore reversed the judgment against Veeck and instructed dismissal of the complaint.

===Dissenting opinions===

There were two dissenting opinions, one for four of the six dissenting judges, another for all six of them. The four-judge opinion argued that it should be left to Congress to decide whether such subject matter should be excluded from copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;293 F.3d at 807 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; They would have decided the case on contract grounds—that Veeck breached the license terms against copying and distribution of the code.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 808.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissenting opinion in which all six dissenters joined would have found copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 809 (Weiner, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; In their view the Supreme Court precedents applied only to judicial opinions.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 811.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissent regarded the majority's policy claims as mere "feel-good" and "symbolic" rhetoric, not supportable, precedent-based substantive law. The public benefits, they claimed, by delegating the code-drafting process to such organizations as SBCCI, for they can provide the service at a lower cost and in a more
efficient and expert manner; however, these organizations need copyright protection to subsidize their public-service activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted appeal to Supreme Court==

SBCCI petitioned for certiorari but it was denied. Before ruling the Court called for the views of the Solicitor General, who filed an ''amicus curiae'' brief recommending denial of certiorari. The government said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The court of appeals' holding that such a code may be copied by interested members of the public is correct, it is consistent with the views of the only other court of appeals to address the same issue, and it does not conflict with any decision of any other court of appeals.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Br. at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rulings in other circuits and subsequent developments==

It is well established that judicial opinions are not protectable by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Wheaton v. Peters'', 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834). Accord, ''Banks v. Manchester'', 128 U.S. 244 (1888); ''Building Officials &amp; Code Admin. Int'l, Inc. v. Code Tech., Inc.'',  628 F.2d 730, 733-34 (1st Cir.1980) (reviewing case law).&lt;/ref&gt; There is a division of authority, however, on whether to follow the ''Veeck'' case as to municipal building codes.

===Seventh Circuit===

In  ''International Code Council, Inc. v. National Fire Code Protection Ass'n, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; one company engaged in the business of promoting building codes sued another such company for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;ICC is the result of a 1994 merger among Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI).&lt;/ref&gt; The Illinois district court interpreted ''Veeck'' to hold that it is the enactment of a model code into law that makes the code unprotectable under copyright law rather than inevitable lack of expression. The court did not reach a conclusive result, however, when the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. Among other things, the court held: "Defendant has not shown that the disputed provisions of Plaintiff's model building code are not copyrightable as a matter of law."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at *93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Atlantic Woodland Corp. v. DRH Cambridge Homes, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4964 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; the court considered a copyright infringement action for copying village development plans that had been accepted as part of an agreement to annex the area, so that the plans became required by law and fell into the public domain. The court held those such facts, if proved, would provide a complete defense, and it therefore denied a motion to dismiss the defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at *23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ninth Circuit===

On the other hand, in ''Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. American Med. Ass'n'', the Ninth Circuit held that incorporation of a classification system (taxonomy) for medical procedures in Medicare and Medicaid regulations does not make them unprotectable under copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;121 F.3d 516, 518-20 (9th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court limited
the ability of the AMA to enforce its copyright against a health maintenance organization that used the taxonomy in order to comply with federal law requiring it.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 520.&lt;/ref&gt; The court viewed such copyright enforcement as
[[copyright misuse]] – an inequitable extension of the copyright owner's otherwise lawful monopoly. The Ninth Circuit also considered improper a bargain that the AMA had made with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), in which AMA licensed the agency to use its copyrighted taxonomy on a royalty-free basis "in exchange for HCFA's agreement not to use a competing coding system."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Circuit===

And in ''CCC Info. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Mkt. Reports, Inc.'', the Second Circuit held that incorporation of used-car valuations in insurance statutes and regulations does not make them unprotectable by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;44 F.3d 61, 73-74 (2d Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Circuit===

In ''John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;322 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  the First Circuit declined to follow ''Veeck''. A real estate developer had acquired a parcel of land covered by a 30-year restrictive covenant to which a previous owner had agreed. The covenant required that any residential development conform with site plan drawings submitted by the previous owner. The new owner tried to modify these restrictions; when it failed to do so it built a condominium subdivision that adhered to the site plans in the covenant. The architectural firm that had earlier designed those plans then sued for copyright infringement, and eventually won a jury verdict and a judgment in the district court for over $1.3 million—essentially all the profits made from the now-complete condominium project. The district court dismissed the affirmative defense based on ''Veeck''. The defendant corporation that had built the condominium subdivision appealed. On appeal, the First Circuit held that the covenant and its drawings were not equivalent to the village zoning law nor was the village's vote to approve the restrictive covenant, incorporating by reference the drawings; it therefore held ''Veeck'' inapplicable and affirmed the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''Id'', at 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an earlier First Circuit case, however, ''Building Officials &amp; Code Adm'rs v. Code Tech., Inc.'', the court had denied copyright protection in a building code that a private organization drafted, because the court thought the group did not need a copyright incentive to draft the code and because the court saw potentially serious due process concerns with access to the code if the copyright was enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Officials &amp; Code Adm'rs v. Code Tech., Inc.'', 628 F.2d 730, 734-35 (1st Cir. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Circuit patent case===

In ''[[State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Circuit upheld the validity of a patent that effectively covered a section of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations. In its 1998 ''State Street Bank'' opinion, the Federal Circuit upheld U.S. Patent No. 5,193,056, entitled "Data Processing System for Hub and Spoke Financial Services Configuration," because it "produced 'a useful, concrete and tangible result'—a final share price momentarily fixed for recording and reporting purposes and even accepted and relied upon by regulatory authorities and in subsequent trades." As shown in the Wikipedia article on the case, a chart is shown that illustrates how the wording of the patent claim corresponds to the US tax statute and regulations, so that the patent is thus, in effect, one on compliance with US tax law by using a computer (which is the only feasible way to comply with the law).

In ''[[In re Bilski]]'', however, the Federal Circuit decided that the ''State Street Bank'' test "is insufficient to determine whether a claim is patent-eligible under §&amp;nbsp;101,"&lt;ref&gt;''In re Bilski'', 545 F.3d 943, 959 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc).&lt;/ref&gt; and "is inadequate,"&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 960.&lt;/ref&gt; so that it "should not longer be relied on."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 960 n.19.&lt;/ref&gt; On the appeal of ''Bilski'' to the Supreme Court, a concurring opinion by Justice Breyer stated that the members of the Court were unanimous that ''State Street'' was not the law.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'', 561 U.S. 593, 659-60 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

Many academic commentators support the Fifth Circuit's approach in ''Veeck'' as advancing the public interest but some criticize it as a derogation of creators' rights and as disincentivizing.

===Cunningham===

Lawrence A. Cunningham,&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mlr104&amp;div=34&amp;start_page=291&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults ''Private Standards In Public Law: Copyright, Lawmaking and the Case of Accounting''], 104 {{smallcaps|Mich. L. Rev}}. 291 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; compared the three ''Veeck'' opinions—the Jones majority opinion, the Higginbotham dissent, and the "blistering" Weiner dissent.&lt;ref&gt;See ''id'' at 305.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cunningham saw Higginbotham's dissenting opinion as the one of the three opinions that "most resonates in expressing the federal judiciary's inherent limitations in addressing such a sprawling public policy issue."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 307.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view: "Cases and controversies federal courts resolve are not suitable forums to provide optimal solutions to the problems of private standards embodied in public law. Such a framework must be provided by a more elaborate policy-oriented process."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham suggests that when government endorsement abrogates copyright, as ''Veeck'' holds, perhaps that is a "taking" that the Constitution insists be based on procedural due process and adequate compensation.

=== Ghosh ===

Shubha Ghosh&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tulr78&amp;div=38&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals Shubha Ghosh, ''Copyright as Privatization: The Case of Model Codes''], 78 {{smallcaps|Tulane L. Rev.}} 653 (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt; questions the viability of a market-oriented approach in which it is assumed "that citizens do have access because either the market will provide the code to public entities, who make the decisions about access to citizens, or the market will provide to those who can pay."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 686.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt; But by turning the drafting process into a market, one potentially turns a democratic process into a discrete transaction between a demander of laws (the legislature) and a supplier of laws (the drafting organization). Furthermore, the financing of law making through public means also undermines democratic values. In most private code drafting cases, the organization allows the state to use the model code without charge. The organization finances its enterprise through sales of the draft code to libraries, law firms, and other interested parties. In other words, general tax revenues are not used to fund law making. To the extent that tax revenues serve to maintain government accountability, the power over the purse strings is lost in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 686.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ghosh considers unworkable the majority compromise in which the black-letter text of the code is not subject to copyright while the notes and comments are subject.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Veeck'', 293 F.2d at 806.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the text often cannot be understood properly without recourse to the notes and comments, because of "the interdependence between enacted code and notes, both for interpretation purposes and in the enactment process."&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh at 688.&lt;/ref&gt; He points to alternative incentivization means: "professionals in the fields affected by particular standards and codes may have ample incentive to continue to buy the official sets of
standards notwithstanding the potential availability of other, unofficial editions."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 689 (quoting amicus curiae brief of Solicitor General regarding the certiorari petition. [http://www.usdoj.gov/osj/briefs/2002/2pet/6invit/toc3index.html Brief of Amicus Curiae United States], at 18-19, ''Veeck'' case, 537 U.S. 1043 (2002) (No. 02-355).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karjala===

[[Dennis Karjala]] sees building codes as functional works designed to regulate how buildings are built:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case against copyright protection for privately drafted model codes is .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. quite strong, on both public policy and traditional copyright grounds. The initial panel decision&lt;ref&gt;See 241 F.3d 398 (5th Cir. 2001), rev'd, 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (''en banc'').&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''en banc'' dissent in ''Veeck'', however, as well as the cases on which they rely,  show the power of the "restitutionary impulse" in the judiciary and courts' willingness to fill apparent gaps in protection by expanding copyright coverage. Even the ''en banc'' majority in ''Veeck'' was unable to craft an opinion that would treat model codes as what the opinion expressly recognizes them to be-if not as directly functional works, then as works that are designed and intended to be used as functional tools for regulating various forms of human behavior through enactment into law.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis S. Karjala, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/conlr35&amp;div=19&amp;start_page=439&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults ''Distinguishing Patent and Copyright Subject Matter''], 35 {{smallcaps|Conn. L. Rev.}} 439, 503 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hardy===

Trotter Hardy views ''Veeck'' as an example of [[eminent domain]] without compensation: "In other words, we have a case of some governmental body taking action to turn what was otherwise an item of private property into a public one, for sound reasons of public benefit." But the "taking" is without compensation under the Fifth Amendment's requirements for "due process" and "just compensation."&lt;ref&gt;See ''CCC Ifo. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Mkt. Reports'', 44 F.3d 61,74 (2d Cir. 1994) ("would raise very substantial problems under the Takings Clause of the Constitution").&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''Veeck'' does not openly "take" the property. Instead, it determines that "if the government has a need for the use of .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. private property, then the property must no longer be 'property' at all." Hardy argues that if a building code is original and expressive enough to gain copyright in the first place, the legislative act of making it a law does not change those facts to turn it into non-property.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter Hardy, [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&amp;context=facpubs ''The Copyrightability of New Works of Authorship''], 38 {{smallcaps|Hous. L. Rev.}} 855, 877-78 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===McJohn===

Stephen McJohn argues that the ''Veeck'' court's use of the merger doctrine to resolve the case "is a blunt instrument because it entails holding that the model code loses all copyright protection once adopted." That would permit not only nonprofit uses but also copying and use "for strictly commercial purposes." In contrast, application of the doctrine of "fair use would permit a more nuanced approach." Moreover, the fair use doctrine "can
be used to authorize free expression without the doctrinal problems of
the merger doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. McJohn, [http://www.mttlr.org/volten/McJohn.pdf  ''Eldred's Aftermath: Tradition, The Copyright Clause, and the Constitutionalization of Fair Use''], 10 {{smallcaps|Mich. Telecomm. &amp; Tech. L. Rev.}} 95, 132 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hughes===

Justin Hughes also argues for use of an alternative doctrine. He maintains that implied license is a better tool than the fair use doctrine or merger doctrine in cases such as ''Veeck''. The problem Hughes sees with fair use is that the fourth statutory fair use factor—effect on the plaintiff's market—has become dominant. That would tend to outlaw wholesale copying as occurred in ''Veeck''. "In contrast, the implied license doctrine may both cover the most important created fact cases and prompt a certain amount of self-selection on the question of copyright incentives." Hughes argues that the facts of such cases typically support an implied license rationale: "once the model code is written, the professional association effectively 'hands it over' to the government knowing that the government will reproduce and distribute the expression. In the case law, these are paradigmatic indicators of an implied license."&lt;ref&gt;Justin Hughes, [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol83/iss1/2 ''Created Facts and the Flawed Ontology of Copyright Law''], 83 {{smallcaps|Notre Dame L. Rev.}} 43, 95–96 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes proposes that the scope of the implied license should be "determined by considering the reasonable expectations of the parties in view of all of the circumstances, including the parties' conduct."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 97 &amp; n.298 (citing Mark D. Janis, ''A Tale of the Apocryphal Axe: Repair, Reconstruction, and the Implied License in Intellectual Property Law'', 58 {{smallcaps|Md. L. Rev.}} 423, 502 (1999) for this formulation of the test).&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the merger doctrine does not need to be abandoned in this field, especially where the circumstances are such that the subject matter "would be created even if the creator knew that the results would not be protectable under copyright." But in cases where the "elimination of copyright's incentive for yet-to-be-created expressions .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. would prevent [them] from ever coming into existence," merger should give way to sharing under what amounts to a compulsory license. This would preserve the incentive policies of copyright law and the public policy underlying the merger doctrine. "Instead of doctrine-distorting machinations to withhold application of the merger doctrine, we should apply it in a sensible way that does not destroy the future flow of both expressions of facts and the facts themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, ''id''. at 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samuelson===

Pamela Samuelson sees "perverse incentives" in permitting copyright protection on model codes, saying the ''Veeck'' case illustrates the temptation created:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the deal SBCCI offered, local governments such as those in Anna and Savoy got royalty-free rights to use the code and one or more copies to make available in a public office. 20 8 But SBCCI charged a substantial fee to anyone else who wanted a copy of the code or access to it, and got referrals from building inspectors and other public officials, making public employees into a kind of free sales force for SBCCI. The perverse incentives problem is of particular concern because of the increasing frequency with which governments are actively encouraging government adoption of privately drafted industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/bclr48&amp;div=14&amp;start_page=193&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults ''Questioning Copyrights in Standards''], 48 B.C.L. {{smallcaps|Rev}}. 193, 223 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Samuelson questions whether organizations need copyright incentives to develop and maintain industry standards and codes that they promulgate and whether arguments based on incentives should prevail over other considerations. She maintains that they generally have ample incentives to develop them for use by professionals in their fields and that "it is simply not credible to claim that organizations .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. would stop developing [them] without copyright protection."&lt;ref&gt;''Id'', at 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sibley===

Jessica Sibley takes issue with the Fifth Circuit majority's "unfair" assertion—"The citizens are the authors of the law, and therefore its owners, regardless of who actually drafts the provisions, because the law derives its authority from the consent of the public, expressed through the democratic process."&lt;ref&gt;See 293 F.3d at 799.&lt;/ref&gt; She dismisses this as ''power to the people'' rhetoric and mythology used as an excuse for expropriation of the property rights of SBCCI:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This political origin story justifies the redistribution of property from private sweat and equity to "the people" who are thereby enriched (albeit via an enrichment of the public domain) with the casting of a ballot. The authenticity and authority of the expression-the model code ''cum'' law derives not from the labor that made it, but the power and force (and myth) of the people speaking their desire as one. The origin here is not the source of the model code but the source of the law, the people who invent themselves through consensual self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Sibley, [http://lsr.nellco.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=suffolk_fp ''The Mythical Beginnings of Intellectual Property''], 15 {{smallcaps|Geo. Mason L. Rev.}} 319, 356 (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5455">'''William Ewen''' (April 15, 1720 – January 24, 1777) was the first president of the [[Council of Safety]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the [[American Revolution]]. He is considered the state's first [[List of Governors of Georgia|chief executive]], although the first chief executive under a proper constitutional government (the "Rules and Regulations" of 1776) was [[Archibald Bulloch]], and the first person to hold the title of (non-royal) "governor" was [[John A. Treutlen]].

==Early life==

Believed to have been born in [[England]] in 1720, Ewen came to Georgia in 1734 as an [[indentured servant]] and worked for Thomas Causton, chief magistrate and storekeeper in Savannah, in the Trustee store for the term of two years. A former potter in England, Ewen left his position at the store when that controversial establishment closed, bought goods at discounted prices, and ventured out on his own as an auctioneer in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pressly|first1=Paul M.|title=On the Rim of the Caribbean : Colonial Georgia and the British Atlantic World|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|page=132|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e000xna&amp;AN=516915&amp;site=eds-live&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_132|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

In 1741, he worked in the private store of John Bromfield, and became one of the so-called "Malcontents" who opposed the Trustees of the colony. Trustee secretary [[William Stephens (Georgia)|William Stephens]] wrote about Ewen: "There is not a more virulent little mischief maker among ‘em, this Ewen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Lucian Lamar|title=The Colonial Papers of the State of Georgia. Volume 23|date=1914|publisher=Charles P. Byrd|location=Atlanta|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23IOAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;ots=1yr2PBJkUQ&amp;dq=%22virulent%20mischief%20maker%22&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=%22virulent%20mischief%20maker%22%20%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ewen was elected to the Commons House of Assembly on March 25, 1761, working under provincial governor Sir [[James Wright (governor)|James Wright]]. Ewen was elected president of the Council of Safety on June 22, 1775 and served until December 11, 1775. He served alongside other famous Revolutionary War heroes of Georgia including [[Seth John Cuthbert]], [[Joseph Habersham]], [[Edward Telfair]], William LeConte, Basil Cowper, Joseph Clay, [[George Walton]], John Glenn, [[Samuel Elbert]], William Young, Elisha Butler, George Houston, John Smith, Francis H. Harris and John Morel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Charles C.|title=The history of Georgia|date=1883|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGk1AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=%22William%20Ewen%22%20georgia&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q=%22William%20Ewen%22%20georgia&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When news of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] reached Georgia, it ignited the revolutionary movement with Ewen at the forefront as a [[Sons of Liberty|Son of Liberty]]. By the end of January 1775, Ewen, with many others, signed the [[Continental Association]], adding Georgia to the colonies against the rule of Great Britain.
