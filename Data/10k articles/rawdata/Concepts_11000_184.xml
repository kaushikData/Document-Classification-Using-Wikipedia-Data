The '''Abortion Rights Campaign''' (ARC) is an Irish [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] group. Its  main aim is the introduction of free, safe and legal abortion care in Ireland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Submission to the Citizens' Assembly |date=2016-12-15 |pages=1 |url=https://issuu.com/abortionrightscampaign/docs/citizens_assembly_front |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant aim prior to May 2018 was the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which was achieved by the successful passing of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2018 Thirty-Sixth Amendment 2018]. ARC also campaigns for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to introduce extensive abortion legislation in common with the rest of the United Kingdom and "to ensure the health of women in pregnancy is protected in line with international human rights standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About ARC {{!}} Abortion Rights Campaign Ireland|url = http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/about-arc/|website = www.abortionrightscampaign.ie|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC supports the full decriminalisation of abortion in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abortion must be fully decriminalised |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/01/16/abortion-must-be-fully-decriminalised/ |website=Abortion Rights Campaign Blog |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Abortion Rights Campaign was formed on 10 July 2012, when 40 people came together. Initially formed as the Irish Choice Network, after another meeting in the [[Gresham Hotel]] in [[Dublin]] on 8 December 2012 and another meeting in 19 January 2013 the Abortion Rights Campaign was formally launched. It has organised the annual March for Choice in Dublin since 2013.

Many Irish politicians have supported ARC's aims, such as [[Richard Boyd Barrett]] ([[Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit]]), [[Catherine Murphy (politician)|Catherine Murphy]] ([[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]]), [[Mick Wallace]], [[Joan Collins (politician)|Joan Collins]] and [[Clare Daly]] ([[Independents 4 Change]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=March For Choice Attracts Thousands In Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However ARC itself is not affiliated with any political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=ARC is not affiliated to any political party |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/11/22/arc-is-not-affiliated-to-any-political-party/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARC was one of the main partner organisations in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Yes Together for Yes], the civil society group advocating a Yes vote in the 2018 referendum. One of ARC's founding members was a co-director of Together for Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.togetherforyes.ie/about-us/our-executive/|title=Together for Yes Executive|last=|first=|date=|website=Together for Yes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC's network of regional groups across the island of Ireland formed the basis for many Together for Yes groups in several counties in Ireland. 

In January 2016, they received a grant of €23,000 from [[Open Society Foundation]] for "educational and stigma-busting projects." [[Standards in Public Office Commission|SIPO]] reasoned that the money had been raised for a political purpose. The ARC returned the money in November 2016, while disagreeing with the finding. The story was first published in ''[[The Irish Catholic]]'' in late March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abortion-rights-campaign-group-returns-us-donation-after-sipo-warning-1.3033589|newspaper=The Irish Times|title=Abortion Rights Campaign group returns US donation after SIPO warning|date=1 April 2017|first=Aine|last=McMahon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-rights-campaign-return-e23000-to-foreign-donor-3316866-Apr2017/|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation|date=1 April 2017|first=Gráinne|last=Ní Aodha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=freesafelegal|number=848161372441628672|date=1 April 2017|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation (via @thejournal_ie)|author=Abortion Rights IE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Irish Catholic]]|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/pro-repeal-group-return-billionaire%E2%80%99s-cash-after-ethics-watchdog-probe|title=Pro-repeal group return billionaire’s cash after ethics watchdog probe|date=30 March 2017|first=Greg|last=Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ARC is an all-volunteer, non-hierarchical organisation. Membership elect a Convening Group annually, which convenes a Steering Group made up of representatives of several working groups and regional groups. Ongoing decision-making is carried out by the Steering Group during regular meetings. There is no one leader or spokesperson of ARC as the Convening and Working Group roles change on a regular basis. This structure is designed to encourage engagement and activity by all members, and to avoid power hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Annual Report 2015 |date=2017-12-06 |pages=8-9 |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/12/06/our-annual-report-2015/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March for Choice==
The Abortion Rights Campaign's most visible event is the annual March for Choice, normally held on the [http://www.september28.org/ Global Day of Action for Safe and Legal Access to Abortion]. The March is organised by ARC and attended by the public, as well as various national pro-choice groups, including trade unions such as [[Unite the Union|Unite]], [[Mandate (trade union)|Mandate]], [[Teachers Union of Ireland]], [[National Union of Journalists]] and [[Union of Students in Ireland]], political parties including [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]], [[Solidarity–People Before Profit]], and the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]], and international groups such as [[Catholics for Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=‘March for Choice’ attracts thousands in Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mary Carolan |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/campaign-for-legal-abortions-says-new-laws-too-restrictive-1.1542611 |title=Campaign for legal abortions says new laws too restrictive |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent March for Choice was held on 29 September 2018, the first since the vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/march-for-choice-dublin-2-4260824-Sep2018/|title=Large crowds as March for Choice takes place in Dublin|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=2018-09-29|work=The Journal|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was 'Free Safe Legal', the slogan of ARC, and was chosen to "show [their] support for stigma-free abortion access for anyone who wants or needs one, regardless of their financial or legal status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/09/16/march-for-choice-29th-september/|title=March for Choice 29th September|last=|first=|date=2018-09-16|website=Abortion Rights Campaign|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers included ARC co-conveners Sarah Monaghan and Denise O'Toole, Zanele Sibindi of Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, Evie Nevin of Disabled Women for Yes and Emma Campbell and Kellie O'Dowd from the Belfast-based Alliance for Choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2017 March for Choice was held on 30 September and over 40,000 people took part. The rally at the march's conclusion was addressed by [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]].  Additional "sympathy marches" were held in 20 cities around the world, including London, Sydney and Nicosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0930/908737-march-for-choice/|title=Tens of thousands take part in March for Choice rally|publisher=RTÉ|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/thousands-attend-dublin-abortion-rights-protest-1.3239832|title=Thousands attend Dublin abortion rights protest|publisher=The Irish Times|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Active student response (ASR) techniques''' are strategies to elicit observable responses from students in a classroom. They are grounded in the field of behavioralism and operate by increasing opportunities reinforcement during class time, typically in the form of instructor praise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Van Norman, Renee; Fitzgerald, Nancy; Kaffar, Bradley (2008). "High and Low Technology for Increasing Students' Active Responding in College Classrooms". ''Proceedings of SITE 2008--Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference'': 1550–1555.&lt;/ref&gt; Active student response techniques are designed so that student behavior, such as responding aloud to a question, is quickly followed by reinforcement if correct.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;R., Joyce, Bruce (1996).

[[OCLC]] 33079138.&lt;/ref&gt; Common form of active student response techniques are choral responding, response cards, guided notes, and clickers. While they are commonly used for disabled populations, these strategies can be applied at many different levels of education.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tincani, Matt; Twyman, Janet S. (2016).

== History ==
Active student response techniques are grounded in the field of [[behaviorism]], a movement in psychology that believes behaviors are responses to stimuli and motivated by past reinforcement. The field has its origins in experiments of [[Edward Thorndike]], who pioneered the [[Law of effect]], which is now known as reinforcement and punishment. Thorndike explained that behaviors that produce a positive effect become more likely to reoccur, given the same scenario. Conversely, behaviors that produce a negative effect become less likely to reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;G.,, Myers, David. ''Psychology''. DeWall, C. Nathan, 1954- (Twelfth edition ed.). New York. {{ISBN|9781319050627}}. [[OCLC]] 1018431994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] applied the principles of behaviorism to influence education. Skinner believed that students must be active in the classroom and that effective instruction is based on positive reinforcement. According to Skinner, teachers should avoid punishment, as it only teaches students to avoid punishment. Instead, lessons should be broken into small tasks with clear instruction and positive reinforcement. His beliefs led him to invent the [[teaching machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, James G. (1992). "B. F. Skinner (1904-1990): Obituary." ''American Psychologist''. '''47''' (5): 665–667. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1037//0003-066x.47.5.665. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0003-066X.&lt;/ref&gt; Active student response techniques use Skinner's model to provide rapid reinforcement for desired responses. This increases the likelihood the responses will occur again. Also, these techniques may give instructors an opportunity to embrace technology in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The foundation of active student response techniques is behaviorism's stimulus-response-reinforcement paradigm. A [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is any environmental change that may produce a response. In an academic setting, a stimulus is often a verbal cue. The response may be any change by the subject, such as an emotion or a behavior. Reinforcers are either positive or negative. In an academic setting, confirmation of a correct answer may be a positive reinforcer. So, active student response techniques aim to arrange the paradigm so the response is most correct. This includes separating instruction into small, achievable steps, providing clear and quick feedback, and including many repetitions. As a result, the correct response will have a strong relationship to the stimulus, creating more learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Choral responding ===
Choral responding is a low-tech, high-ASR strategy that paces instruction throughout a class. In this strategy, students are prompted to respond orally in unison to questions posed by an instructor. For choral responding to work, questions must be presented clearly, be able to answered briefly, and have one correct answer. Choral responding is useful for reviewing subject matter, solving problems, or spelling words. It may be used to review previously covered content or provide feedback throughout a class period.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Twyman, Janet; Heward, William (2016-05-01). "How to improve student learning in every classroom now". ''International Journal of Educational Research''. '''87'''. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1016/j.ijer.2016.05.007.&lt;/ref&gt; Choral responding is effective in both small- and whole-group instruction, for students from preschool through secondary grades, in both general education and special education, as measured by learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The instructional format for choral responding is the following:

# Instructor poses a question (e.g. "What is 9x9?")
# Appropriate wait-time pause
# Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. "Tell me.")
# Instructor provides feedback for the majority answer (e.g. Correct! 9x9 is 81.")

=== Response cards ===
Response cards are cards, signs, or other objects held up by students in unison in response to a question posed by an instructor. Write-on response cards, such as whiteboards, allow students to write their answers on the spot and erase between learning trials. Pre-printed response cards are pre-made and are often true/false or colors to indicate answers. Both types of response cards promote high-ASR by allowing all students to respond to all questions, instead of one student responding to each. Instructors can easily gauge learning using response cards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heward, William L (Spring 1997). "FOUR VALIDATED INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES". ''Behavior and Social Issues''. '''7'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructional format of response cards is similar to choral responding, as follows:

# Instructor poses a question with a clear, quick response (e.g. "What is the atomic number of carbon?")
# Appropriate wait-time pause for students to write answers
# Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. "Show me your boards!")
# Instructor provides feedback (e.g. "That's right! The atomic number of carbon is 6.) Occasionally, the instructor may want to address some of the incorrect responses that were given.

Implementing response cards in a classroom may increase questions posed by the instructor, increase academic performance, and be favored by students. The technique is effective in both general education and special education. Response cards may also increase on-task behavior in the classroom and decrease disruptive behavior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Response cards are most effective when paired with brisk instructional pacing. Instructors have been easily able to implement response cards and achieve a response rate of approximately one response per minute. The brisk instructional pace maximized responses in a class period without sacrificing accuracy and while minimizing problem behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Guided notes ===
Notetaking serves both a process and product function. But, traditional notetaking is dependent on attendance, criterion knowledge, and attention. Often, students may be inefficient note takers by recording incomplete, verbatim notes. Distributing instructor's notes increases academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kiewra, Kenneth A. (1987-09-01). "Notetaking and review: The research and its implications". ''Instructional Science''. '''16''' (3): 233–249. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1007/BF00120252. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0020-4277.&lt;/ref&gt; Guided notes aims to improve notetaking behavior by ensuring complete and accurate notes.

Guided notes are prepared handouts containing standard cues to guide a student through a lecture. The handouts are often based on the instructor's notes with blank spaces throughout for the student to fill in. In the blank spaces, the student is to complete the information or concept, creating a high-ASR strategy with many response opportunities throughout the lecture. The blank spaces should be varied and may allow for many different types of responses, such as drawing pictures or graphs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While mostly low-tech, guided notes has the option to use many high-tech applications, such as software that makes guided notes from completed notes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Guided notes are used in both K-12 level and college levels. The active student response technique improves assessment scores, accuracy of notes, and student responses during lecture. Most students prefer guided notes over traditional notetaking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The instructional format of guided notes is as follows:

# Instructor makes an outline of the lecture, and should contain clear typographical cues, such as bullet points
# Instructor replaces some sections with blank spaces where the student will write in the information
# Guided notes are distributed to students for the lecture

Example of guided notes:
 The space between two neurons is the _________. Neurons most often exhibit _______ signaling within cells and _______ signaling between cells.                                                                                                                                             The generation of the _______ potential produces an ______-or-none response. So, greater intensity stimulation produces higher ________.

=== High-tech strategies ===
Response strategies can be implemented using commercially available technologies, such as clickers or mobile phone apps. Similar to response cards, the instructor would pose a question and ask for a response from the class. Some of the process may be automated with a software that uses a clear signal for response and collects student responses. Though, high-tech strategies are not as well researched.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Active student response techniques can be applied to nearly all levels of education. Also, the techniques can be used with multiple populations. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) prioritizes accessible general education that includes individuals with disabilities, including those with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, and behavior disorders. Active student response benefits the inclusion of students with disabilities in classrooms by facilitating all students' participation in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Higher education may also benefit from active student response techniques.. Undergraduate classrooms would often benefit from implementing the techniques. While traditional lectures serve a function in higher education, such as setting context and synthesizing information, the reliance on passive learning is not as effective as active student learning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Active student response strategies can be either low- or high-tech. High-tech strategies, which use electrical devices, may utilize mobile phones, clickers, or other devices. Low-tech strategies do not require any electrical devices and may not require anything more than pencil and paper. Examples include guided notes and response cards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The range of technology that can be used broadens the applications of active student response.

== Compared to traditional teaching styles ==
Traditional lecturing, in which an instructor speaks uninterrupted for the majority of the class, is often less effective than active student response techniques. Without active participation from students and contingent positive reinforcement for correct responses, traditional lecturing does not reinforce desired behaviors. Traditional lecturing may allow disorganized delivery of information. Implementing active student response techniques into lectures ensures the lectures function to assess, instruct, plan, and evaluate.

Active student response techniques have been shown to increase learning, compared to traditional lecture. During lectures with active student response, students exhibited more on-task behavior, and instructors received more feedback. Frequency of active student responses is correlated with performance on evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instructors also remarked that active student participation provides instructors with clear feedback and promotes a more inclusive nature of the classroom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, active student response also demands a higher cost. Instructors must supply or prepare any necessary materials. For example, to implement guided notes, instructors must write and print the notes to distribute to students. Similarly, the techniques demand more time from instructors. It may take added preparation to plan all of the questions throughout class. If an instructor chooses to use response cards, the instructor must prepare questions to which the class can respond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17382">{{redirect|Afford|other meanings|Afford (disambiguation)}}'''Affordance''' is what the environment offers the individual. [[James J. Gibson]], coined the term in his 1966 book, ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems'',&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1966). ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems''. Allen and Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in many of his earlier essays (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1975). 'Affordances and behavior'. In E. S. Reed &amp; R. Jones (eds.), ''Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson'', pp. 410-411. Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 1 edn.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, his best-known definition is taken from his seminal 1979 book, ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'':{{Quote|The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.|Gibson (1979, p. 127)&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original definition in psychology includes all transactions that are possible between an individual and their environment. When the concept was applied to design, it started also referring to only those physical action possibilities of which one is aware.

The word is used in a variety of fields: [[perceptual psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[Environmental Psychology|environmental psychology]], [[industrial design]], [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), [[interaction design]], [[user-centered design]], [[communication studies]], [[instructional design]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS), [[sports science]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

== Original development ==
Psychologist [[James J. Gibson]] developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''&lt;ref name=Gibson1979&gt;[[James J. Gibson]] (1979), ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'', {{ISBN|0-89859-959-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an [[ecological niche]] emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. An affordance is independent of an individual's ability to recognize it or even take advantage of it, and so, should not be confused with a privately perceived world or a [[phenomenology of perception]]. The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises four feet high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.”&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1982). Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson. Resources for Ecological Psychology. L. Erlbaum, New Jersey. p.411&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology.

According to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. On his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation.

Gibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization. The theory of affordances introduces a "value-rich ecological object".&lt;ref  name=Gibson1979 /&gt; Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000&gt;Emma Williams and Alan Costall (2000), ''Taking Things More Seriously: Psychological Theories of Autism and the Material-Social Divide'', {{ISBN|0-415-16704-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000 /&gt; And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world.

Affordances were further studied by [[Eleanor J. Gibson]], wife of [[James J. Gibson]], who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, ''An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development'', explores affordances further.

[[Jakob von Uexküll]] had already discussed the concept in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Uexküll, Jakob von (1980 [1920 etc.]), ''{{lang|de|Kompositionslehre der Natur}}'', edited by Thure von Uexküll, Frankfurt am Main.&lt;/ref&gt; calling it the "functional tinting" (''{{lang|de|funktionale Tönung}}'') of organisms with respect to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Foray Into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With a Theory of Meaning |author =Dorion Sagan |editor1=Jakob von Uexküll |editor2=Marina von Uexküll |editor3=Joseph D. O'Neil |chapter=Introduction: ''Umwelt'' after Uexküll  |page=5 |isbn=9781452903798 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADSDl6_SeW8C&amp;pg=PA5 |edition = Joseph D O'Neil translation of 1940 |year=2010 |quote=Organisms in their life-worlds recognize not only sensory inputs, but also functional tones, the use they need to make of certain stimuli if they are to do what they need to survive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2002.1998 |title= Attentional processes link perception and action |year= 2002 |last1= Anderson |first1= S. J. |last2= Yamagishi |first2= N. |last3= Karavia |first3= V. |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume= 269 |issue= 1497 |pages= 1225|pmc= 1691021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As perceived action possibilities ==
In 1988, [[Donald Norman]] appropriated the term ''affordances'' in the context of [[Human-machine interaction|human–machine interaction]] to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of "action possibilities" has now become synonymous with Gibson's work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing.&lt;ref&gt;R. Osborne (2015). An ecological approach to educational technology: affordance as a design tool for aligning pedagogy and technology. Ph.D. thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Norman's book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman]], ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]],'' {{ISBN|0-465-06710-7}}, originally published under the title ''The Psychology of Everyday Things'' (often abbreviated to ''POET'')&lt;/ref&gt; this interpretation was popularized within the fields of [[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]], [[interaction design]], and [[user-centered design]]. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a [[softball]], Gibson's original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's affordances "suggest" how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical [[design]] problems {{why|date=February 2017}}, which may explain its widespread adoption.

Norman later explained that this restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and that he would replace it by "perceived affordance" in any future revision of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman|Donald A. Norman]] (1999). Affordance, Conventions and Design. ''Interactions'' 6(3):38-43, May 1999, ACM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordance_conv.html Affordance, Conventions and Design (Part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the definition from his book has been widely adopted in HCI and interaction design, and both meanings are now commonly used in these fields.

Following Norman's adaptation of the concept, ''affordance'' has seen a further shift in meaning where it is used as an [[uncountable noun]], referring to the easy discoverability of an object or system's action possibilities, as in "this button has good affordance".&lt;ref name="preece-1994" /&gt; This in turn has given rise to a use of the verb ''afford'' – from which Gibson's original term was derived – that is not consistent with its dictionary definition (to provide or make available): designers and those in the field of HCI often use ''afford'' as meaning "to suggest" or "to invite".&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003" /&gt;

The different interpretations of affordances, although closely related, can be a source of confusion in writing and conversation if the intended meaning is not made explicit and if the word is not used consistently. Even authoritative textbooks can be inconsistent in their use of the term.&lt;ref name="preece-1994"&gt;''Human–Computer Interaction'', Preece et al. (1994, p. 6): The authors explicitly define perceived affordances as being a subset of all affordances, but another meaning is used later in the same paragraph by talking about "good affordance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003"&gt;''Universal Principles of Design'', Lidwell, Holden &amp; Butler (2003, p. 20): The authors first explain that round wheels are better suited for rolling than square ones and therefore better afford (i.e. allow) rolling, but later state that a door handle "affords" (i.e. suggests) pulling, but not pushing.&lt;/ref&gt;

When affordances are used to describe [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) an analogy is created with everyday objects with their attendant features and functions.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012&gt;Faraj, S., &amp; Azad, B. (2012). The Materiality of Technology: an Affordance Perspective. In ''Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World''. {{ISBN|9780199664054}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, ICT's features and functions derive from the product classifications of its developers and designers. This approach emphasizes an artifact’s convention to be wholly located in how it was designed to be used. In contrast, affordance theory draws attention to the fit of the technology to the activity of the user and so lends itself to studying how ICTs may be appropriated by users or even misused.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012/&gt; One meta-analysis reviewed the evidence from a number of surveys about the extent to which the Internet is transforming or enhancing community. The studies showed that the internet is used for connectivity locally as well as globally, although the nature of its use varies in different countries. It found that internet use is adding on to other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, Anabel Quan-Haase, Jeffrey Boase, Wenhong Chen, Keith Hampton, Isabel Diaz de Isla and Kakuko Miyata. 2003.

== False affordances ==
William Gaver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/108844.108856 |chapter=Technology affordances |title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Reaching through technology - CHI '91 |year=1991 |last1=Gaver |first1=William W. |isbn=0897913833 |pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided affordances into three categories: perceptible, hidden, and false.

* A '''false affordance''' is an apparent affordance that does not have any real function, meaning that the actor perceives nonexistent possibilities for action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affordances.html "Affordances"]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of a false affordance is a [[placebo button]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2008/10/01/placebo-buttons-false-affordances-and-habit-forming/ "Placebo buttons, false affordances and habit-forming"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''hidden affordance''' indicates that there are possibilities for action, but these are not perceived by the actor. For example, it is not apparent from looking at a shoe that it could be used to open a wine bottle.
* For an affordance to be '''perceptible''', there is information available such that the actor perceives and can then act upon the existing affordance.

This means that, when affordances are perceptible, they offer a direct link between perception and action, and, when affordances are hidden or false, they can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.

'''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262640201_Brain_Emotional_Learning-Inspired_Models Brain Emotional Learning-inspired Models]''' or '''BELiMs''' can be considered as a primary step to take inspiration from emotional systems to form new computational Intelligence (CI)  models. BELIMs have been inspired by [[fear conditioning]] that is one of the emotional systems in [[mammalians]] and is a mechanism by which a [[biological system]] learns how to predict aversive events.&lt;ref&gt;M. Parsapoor, “Brain Emotional Learning-Inspired Models. Licentiate dissertation”, Halmstad University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis behind the development of BELiMs is that "the neural structure of fear conditioning can be considered as a natural system that consists of some components (e.g., the amygdala, thalamus, and the sensory cortex) and whose functionality is fulfilled through interaction among its components. Fear conditioning as a system shows an intelligent behavior by learning how to respond to fear-induced stimuli and thus can be utilized to design new CI models for prediction and decision-making applications" &lt;ref&gt;[2]M. Parsapoor, ‘Towards Emotion inspired Computational Intelligence (EiCI)’, PhD dissertation, Halmstad University Press, Halmstad, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, '''Epstein–Zin preferences''' refers to a specification of [[recursive]] [[utility]].

A recursive utility function can be constructed from two components: a time aggregator that characterizes preferences in the absence of uncertainty and a risk aggregator that defines the certainty equivalent function that characterizes preferences over static gambles and is used to aggregate the risk associated with future utility.  With Epstein–Zin preferences, the time aggregator is a linearly homogenous [[CES aggregate]] of current consumption and the [[certainty equivalent]] of future utility.  Specifically, the date-t utility index, &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt;, for a sequence of positive scalar consumptions &lt;math&gt;\{c_t, c_{t+1}, c_{t+2}, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;, that are potentially stochastic for time periods beyond date t, is defined recursively as the solution to the nonlinear [[stochastic difference equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
U_t = [ (1-\beta) c_t^\rho + \beta \mu_t(U_{t+1})^\rho ]^{1/\rho} , 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_t( )&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued [[certainty equivalent]] operator.  The parameter &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; determines the marginal rate of [[time preference]], &lt;math&gt;1/\beta -1&lt;/math&gt;, and the parameter &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; determines the [[elasticity of intertemporal substitution]], &lt;math&gt;1/(1-\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.  Epstein and Zin considered a variety of certainty equivalent operators, but a popular choice for both theoretical and empirical research has been &lt;math&gt;\mu_t(U_{t+1})=[E_t U_{t+1}^\alpha]^{1/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expected value of probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;U_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;, conditional on information available to the planner in date t.  The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; encodes risk aversion, with smaller values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, other things equal, implying a stronger aversion to risk.   The parameter restriction &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\rho&lt;/math&gt; results in a time-additive [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann–Morgenstern]] expected utility index.

Importantly, unlike VNM utility functions (e.g. [[isoelastic utility]]), Epstein-Zin preferences allow the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (determined above by &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) to be unrelated to risk aversion (determined above by &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

The '''escalation archetype''' is one of possible types of system behaviour that are known as [[System Archetypes|system archetypes]].

The escalation archetype is common for situations of [[non-cooperative game]]s where each player can make own decisions and these decisions lead to the outcome for the player. However, when both player try to maximize their output (at the expense of the other one) they can get into a loop where each player will try harder and harder to surpass the opponent. While it can have favourable consequences it can also lead to [[self-destructive behaviour]].

== Structure ==

=== Elements of archetype ===

Escalation archetype system can be described using causal loop diagrams which may consist of balancing and reinforcing loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Bellinger|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Bellinger |title=Archetypes - Interaction Structures of the Universe|url=http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#arches|website=Systems Thinking|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Balancing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[negative feedback]] process. In such a structure, a change in system leads to actions that usually eliminate the effect of that change which means that the system tends to remain stable in time.

==== Reinforcing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[positive feedback]] process. This reinforcing feedback causes that even a small change in the system can lead to huge disturbances, e.g. variable A is increased which leads to an increase of variable B which leads to another increase of A and so there might be an [[exponential growth]] over time.

=== Escalation archetype as balancing loops ===
The image below shows escalation archetype as two balancing loops. 
When X makes an action, it leads to a change in results of X relative to results of Y. Y then makes action to equalize the situation and the result again changes the balance and induces another action by X. As this repeats actions done by X and Y are bigger and bigger to keep up with other's actions and results.
[[File:Escalation Archetype - two balancing loops.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as two balancing loops displayed as causal loop diagram]]

=== Escalation archetype as reinforcing loop ===
The causal loop diagram below shows escalation archetype as a single reinforcing loop. It can be read simply as that more action done by X creates bigger results of action done by X. The bigger results of X, the bigger difference between X and Y results. The bigger difference means more action by Y and more action by Y leads to bigger result of Y. The bigger result of Y leads to a smaller difference between X and Y, but the smaller is this difference, the bigger will be the action of X and it starts all over again.
[[File:Escalation archetype - one reinforcing loop.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as one reinforcing loop displayed as causal loop diagram]]

The image below simplifies reinforcing loop and shows general idea of what happens. Increased activity of X leads to an increase of threat for Y which leads to an increased activity by Y. Increased activity by Y leads to increased threat for X which creates another potential for activity of X to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|page=199}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Arms race ===
A well known example of escalation archetype is the [[arms race]]. The idea is that in the arms race two (or more) parties are competing to have the strongest army and weapons. An example is the race in producing nuclear weapons by the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that was an important factor in the [[Cold War]]. Over the time, each party can get temporarily a slight advantage, but then the other one produces or obtains in other way more weapons and gets the advantage on its side, temporarily. In the end, both parties have great military power that is very threatening not only to them but also to non-aligned parties.

=== Picking apples in an orchard ===

The escalation archetype can turn up in situations like picking apples in an orchard. Imagine a big apple orchard with a wealthy crop. An owner of such plantation cannot pick the whole harvest himself because there are simply too many trees. Therefore, he employs gatherers to do the work for him. He tries to figure a way how to measure the work they do so that he can reward them fairly. As he is suspicious that workers would work slowly he is hesitant to link the wage only to hours worked and he comes up with an idea. He divides workers into two groups and declares that the group which will harvest more apples will get a bonus to their regular wage.

Both groups start harvesting apples with passion and energy. First group X collects a pallet a little bit sooner than the second group Y. Therefore, the Y group motivates those who were a little bit slacking to increase their pace. Now Y is a little bit better so they not only catch up but even finish the second load before X group. The X comes with an idea that they should assign roles to their members – some will pick apples from the upper part of trees using ladders while some will collect those that are in the lower part of trees, other will load packs and one person will organise the work and help where necessary. This advantage enables X group to outrun the other again. While Y adapts the model of X, they make some changes and tweaks and soon they are the leading party. This improving of processes continues in several iterations until both parties are exceptionally effective in harvesting apples on the orchard. The owner can be really happy with the situation as containers are quickly being loaded with apples. Should everything continue this way, the orchard could be harvested in few hours with group X beating the group Y by a tenth of a percent. He could reward only the winning team or both teams because they were almost equally hardworking.

However, due to the fact that one group was always a little bit behind, the situation in the middle of day is bad for one of the groups which is slightly behind, let's say it is group Y. Now, they can continue working like up to that moment and they would finish second with a loss of a tenth of a percent. Or they can come up with another idea that would enable them to increase their production output. They have an idea that harvesting topmost apples is slower that harvesting the rest of them. Because of that they decide to skip these apples and only collect the others. This way, the situation escalated into a trouble. While Y could win the competition now, there will be considerable amount of apples left on trees. Or if both groups are instructed not to leave a single apple in the orchard they will have to stay much longer to finish these apples thus the owner will have higher costs for their wage.

Of course the owner could set a condition that none team could leave a tree that until it is fully harvested. That would help in some way to break the escalation archetype unless workers realize they are not punished for some other undesirable behaviour, for example being careless of tree condition after the harvest.

As can be seen in this example, the escalation archetype might bring positive results (faster harvesting) but it is necessary to monitor behaviour of the affected system to ensure long-term prosperity.

=== The attention fight ===

To avoid naming in this example of escalation archetype occurrence, behaviour of imaginary persons Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle is described.

Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle want to become famous celebrities with a lot of money, loving husband and amazing children. They already have many friends and everybody in the town knows each one of them. They all work hard to be best in their field of expertise and soon they are known to the whole country. They know of each other and try to work harder to become more famous than each other. This is when escalation archetype comes into play. They become the most famous celebrities in the country and each one of them realizes that to draw more attention than others they need to be unique and very special. As Amy starts to work even harder than before Betty notices that Amy's fame is growing more than hers and starts to work harder than Amy. This is noted by Cecile and she does what must be done - starts working more than anyone else. But there is also Danielle whose ambitions are not even slightly smaller, she wants to be the most famous celebrity and so she starts working even harder than anyone else. As Amy notices her effort is not sufficient, she does what is obvious - starts to work more than she was.

Now this cycle could repeat continuously until Amy, Betty, Cecile or Danielle dies of overwork. In the meanwhile some of them could start taking drugs with the presumption that it could boost their productivity and ability to concentrate or with the aim to get rid of depressions from working all the time. Another solution presumed by them as feasible would be some way of elimination the opponents - by false accusation or by pointing to their faults.

Or if they found it impossible to be better by simply working more, they could try to figure out some way how to attract attention by qualitative change instead of quantitative. This way Amy could say something shocking in TV. The issue is that due to escalation archetype being in place unfortunately. Betty could simply follow by saying something even more shocking or controversial. Then, Cecile would feel threatened and so she will come up with an idea that she could make controversial photographs. Then Danielle will try to surpass everyone and will do some action that will attract attention of media and public. And they would escalate this to extreme situation (as the behaviour can develop exponentially).

While at the beginning the competitiveness was beneficial for both Amy, Betty, Cecile, Danielle and public, in the long term many issues raised.

What could be a meaningful solution for these ladies? They could have set some limits themselves in their minds, for example how much time they are willing to work to achieve their desire to be a famous celebrity and what is alright to do and what is not. If they are not able to do so, there has to be some mechanism from outside to stop them - e.g. family or friend giving them an advice, as it would be difficult to set legal boundaries in this area.

=== Competing children ===

Tendency of parents to compare their children creates nourishing environment for escalation archetype. Parents tend to compare their kids with other children and among own kids. This creates pressure on children as they are expected to perform well.

Imagine a family with two kids named, for example, Lisa and Bartolomeo. Their parents are very much children-focused and hope their kids will get proper educations and live what they consider successful lives. They invest significant portions of both their family budget and time into both children and hope that this investment will pay off in the form of Lisa and Bartolomeo being successful in school and later in life.

Lisa and Bartolomeo are usual children with some hobbies who study diligently but without extreme passion. They simply do what they got to do. Their results are good but not perfect. So their parents come and start the escalation archetype by telling the kids that the one with better marks will go on special holiday of her or his choice. As both Lisa and Bartolomeo like travelling a lot, they start to study hard. To satisfaction of their parents  children's marks get soon better which is very positive outcome. Yet a problem arises. As they both study really hard to keep pace with the other one, something might go wrong.

For example, when Bartolomeo is very creative and skillful painter but not so talented in studying usual subjects like math or languages. Sooner or later he will reach his limits. Then to keep up the good marks he will have to abandon his painting hobby and his talent will be wasted. Or he will try to sustain great marks and then Bartolomeo will start cheating during exams.

However even when no negative effect happens there will be a difficulty how to reward children after Bartolome finishes second very closely. Should their parents appreciate only Lisa's effort or acknowledge also Bartolomeo's achievements. When they reward only Lisa, Bartolomeo could easily become demotivated and then it would be impossible to make use of positive effects of escalation archetype. On the other hand, rewarding both could mean the same and for both children as they realise that their extra effort does not have necessarily mean better outcome.

There is also an '''alternative version of how competition''' amongst children '''can be affected by escalation archetype'''. When all parents motivate children to improve in comparison to their peers, they will all study harder and harder while the differences amongst participating kids will remain relatively stable (and if teachers increase requirements they will even retain their marks). Under such simple circumstances most children might benefit from the competition nevertheless children with weaker intellectual skill may become isolated when they are no longer able to pursue others. Reversely in another alternative scenario where all children are demotivated to study for some reason, their results are worse and worse (and if teachers decrease requirements they will retain their marks while being less educated) and downward spiral is working in a way that situation gets worse and worse.

== Risks and opportunities ==

The dangers of systems with escalation archetypes are various. First, it might be difficult to identify the existence of archetype at the first sight. Then the behaviour of the system might look desirable at first and therefore requiring no immediate action. Another risk is a possibility of exponential growth within such structure. Finally the system might have different outcome in short term and long term.

Escalation archetype comes with a possibility to make a big change in the system with a little input or a small action done at the beginning (due to the fact that it behaves like reinforcing loop).

== Solution and optimization ==

To remove downward or upward spiral effect of escalation archetype there is a change in the system necessary which breaks the ongoing pattern. That change is typically switching the actors from [[non-cooperative game]] mode to [[cooperative game]] behaviour so that they stop escalating their actions to keep with others and rather find mutual solution and movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Euthymia''' ({{lang-el|εὐθυμία}}, "gladness, good mood, [[tranquillity|serenity]]", literally "good [[thumos]]") is a term used by [[Democritus]] to refer to one of the root aspects of human life's goal.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records Democritus' position as "The chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness (euthymia); which, however, he does not consider the same as pleasure; as some people, who have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant; but he understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldemocritus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s [[De Tranquillitate Animi|essay on tranquility]], he uses the Greek word ''euthymia'', which he defines as “believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iPDUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=believing+in+yourself+and+trusting+that+you+are+on+the+right+path,+and+not+being+in+doubt+by+following+the+myriad+footpaths+of+those+wandering+in+every+direction.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Je4s_cM6X6&amp;sig=EGNvhD50W_iyC5DhFDzHf7HM3G8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0KSEnbrUAhXCl5QKHVjwAo8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=believing%20in%20yourself%20and%20trusting%20that%20you%20are%20on%20the%20right%20path,%20and%20not%20being%20in%20doubt%20by%20following%20the%20myriad%20footpaths%20of%20those%20wandering%20in%20every%20direction.&amp;f=false|title=The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living: Featuring new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|last2=Hanselman|first2=Stephen|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781782833178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Existence''' is the ability to, directly or indirectly, interact with reality or, in more specific cases, the [[universe]]. The exact definition of existence is one of the most important and fundamental topics of [[ontology]], the philosophical study of the nature of [[being]], existence, or reality in general, as well as of the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology deals with questions concerning what things or [[Entity|entities]] exist or can be said to exist, and how such things or entities can be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

[[Materialism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[matter]] and [[energy]], that all things are composed of material, that all actions require energy, and that all phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of material interactions.

[[Idealism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[thoughts]] and [[ideas]],{{cn|date=August 2018}} that all things are composed of strings of reasoning, that all thing(s) require an associated idea of the thing(s), and that all the phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of an understanding of the imprint from the noumenal world in which lies beyond the thing-in-itself.

==Etymology==
The word "existence" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''exsistere'' meaning "to appear", "to arise", "to become", or "to be", but literally, it means "to stand out" (''ex-'' being the Latin prefix for "out" added to the causative of the verb ''stare'', meaning "to stand").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|existence}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a technical sense, this refers to ''standing out'' of both [[being]] and [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], thus having the qualities of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|existence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical conceptions ==
{{See also|Avicennism|Scholasticism}}
In the [[Western world|Western]] tradition of philosophy, the earliest known comprehensive treatments of the subject are from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', though earlier fragmentary writing exists. Aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being, according to which only individual things, called substances, fully have to be, but other things such as relations, quantity, time, and place (called the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]) have a derivative kind of being, dependent on individual things. In Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'', there are [[four causes]] of existence or change in nature: the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause and the final cause.

The [[Neo-Platonist]]s and some early [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except in the mind of God.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Some taught that existence was a snare and a delusion, that the world, the flesh, and the devil existed only to tempt weak humankind away from God.

The [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that God is pure being, and that in God [[essence]] and existence are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marenbon| first = John| authorlink = | title = Medieval Philosophy: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction| publisher = Routledge| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2006| location = | pages = 239| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veGCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| doi = | id = | isbn = 9781134461837| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the [[nominalist]] philosopher [[William of Ockham]] argued, in Book I of his ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Totius Logicae]]'' (''Treatise on all Logic'', written some time before 1327), that Categories are not a form of Being in their own right, but derivative on the existence of individuals.

===Early modern philosophy===
The [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] treatment of the subject derives from [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic'', or ''The Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'', first published in 1662. Arnauld thought that a [[proposition]] or [[Decision making|judgment]] consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them:

{{quote|text=After conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas and, finding that some belong together and others do not, we unite or separate them. This is called affirming or denying, and in general judging.

This judgment is also called a proposition, and it is easy to see that it must have two terms. One term, of which one affirms or denies something, is called the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]; the other term, which is affirmed or denied, is called the attribute or [[predicate (logic)|Praedicatum]].|sign=Antoine Arnauld|source=''The Art of Thinking'' (''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''), 1662, translated by J. Buroker in 1996, Logic, II.3, p. 82}}

The two terms are joined by the verb "is" (or "is not", if the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus every proposition has three components: the two terms, and the "[[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]" that connects or separates them. Even when the proposition has only two words, the three terms are still there. For example, "God loves humanity", really means "God is a lover of humanity", "God exists" means "God is a thing".

This theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries, but it has some obvious difficulties: it only considers proposition of the form "All A are B.", a form logicians call [[universal quantifier|universal]]. It does not allow propositions of the form "Some A are B", a form logicians call [[existential quantifier|existential]]. If neither A nor B includes the idea of existence, then "some A are B" simply adjoins A to B. Conversely, if A or B do include the idea of existence in the way that "triangle" contains the idea "three angles equal to two right angles", then "A exists" is automatically true, and we have an [[ontological proof]] of A's existence. (Indeed, Arnauld's contemporary [[Descartes]] famously argued so, regarding the concept "God" (discourse 4, Meditation 5)). Arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century.

[[David Hume]] argued that the claim that a thing exists, when added to our notion of a thing, does not add anything to the concept. For example, if we form a complete notion of Moses, and superadd to that notion the claim that Moses existed, we are not adding anything to the notion of Moses.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also argued that existence is not a "real" predicate, but gave no explanation of how this is possible. Indeed, his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of Arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition "God is omnipotent", the verb "is" signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as "God" and "omnipotence".{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] claimed that “everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, only object in relation to the subject, the perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.”&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to him there can be "No object without subject" because "everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing, and presupposes these forms&amp;hellip;"&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, § 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicative nature==
[[John Stuart Mill]] (and also Kant's pupil [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like "A [[centaur]] is a [[poetic fiction]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''[[A System of Logic]]'', 1843 I. iv. 1.page 124&lt;/ref&gt; or "A [[greatest number]] is impossible" (Herbart).&lt;ref&gt;''Uberweg'' (System of Logic) §68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Brentano]] challenged this; so also (as is better known) did [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase "an A" to the concept represented by an adjective "B" to give the concept represented by the noun phrase "a B-A". For example, we can join "a man" to "wise" to give "a wise man". But the noun phrase "a wise man" is not a sentence, whereas "some man is wise" is a sentence. Hence the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] must do more than merely join or separate concepts. Furthermore, adding "exists" to "a wise man", to give the complete sentence "a wise man exists" has the same effect as joining "some man" to "wise" using the copula. So the copula has the same effect as "exists". Brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the "exists" and "does not exist" of the existential proposition take the place of the copula. He showed this by the following examples:

: The categorical proposition "Some man is sick" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A sick man exists" or "There is a sick man."

: The categorical proposition "No stone is living" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A living stone does not exist" or "there is no living stone".

: The categorical proposition "All men are mortal" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "An immortal man does not exist" or "there is no immortal man".

: The categorical proposition "Some man is not learned" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A non-learned man exists" or "there is a non-learned man".

Frege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', as did [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (but Peirce held that [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics|the possible and the real are not limited to the actual, individually existent]]). The Frege-Brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in [[Analytic philosophy|modern Anglo-American philosophy]]: that existence is asserted by the [[existential quantifier]] (as expressed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s slogan "To be is to be the value of a variable." — ''On What There Is'', 1948).&lt;ref&gt;''On What There Is'' – in Review of Metaphysics (1948). Reprinted in [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Harvard University Press, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
In [[mathematical logic]], there are two quantifiers, "some" and "all", though as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1838–1917) pointed out, we can make do with just one quantifier and negation. The first of these quantifiers, "some", is also expressed as "there exists". Thus, in the sentence "There exists a man", the term "man" is asserted to be part of existence. But we can also assert, "There exists a triangle." Is a "triangle" — an abstract idea — part of existence in the same way that a "man" — a physical body — is part of existence? Do abstractions such as goodness, blindness, and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs, tables, and houses exist? What [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], or kinds of thing, can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition?

Worse, does "existence" exist?&lt;ref&gt;''To exist is to have a specific relation to existence – a relation, by the way, which existence itself does not have''. [[Bertrand Russell]] – ''The Principles of Mathematics'' – New York, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1903, second edition 1937 pages 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some statements, existence is implied without being mentioned. The statement "A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith" cannot just be about a bridge, the Thames, and Hammersmith. It must be about "existence" as well. On the other hand, the statement "A bridge crosses the Styx at Limbo" has the same form, but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick, what "existence" would mean in the second case is less clear.

The [[nominalist]] approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be "eliminated" by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning but does not contain the noun phrase. Thus [[William of Ockham|Ockham]] argued that "Socrates has wisdom", which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for "wisdom", can be rewritten as "Socrates is wise", which contains only the referring phrase "Socrates".&lt;ref&gt;Klima, G., ''John Buridan'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=7A_iBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt; This method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic school]] of philosophy.

However, this argument may be inverted by [[Philosophical realism|realists]] in arguing that since the sentence "Socrates is wise" can be rewritten as "Socrates has wisdom", this proves the existence of a hidden referent for "wise".

A further problem is that human beings seem to process information about [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] in much the same way that they process information about real people. For example, in the [[2008 United States presidential election]], a politician and actor named [[Fred Thompson]] ran for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination. In polls, potential voters identified Fred Thompson as a "law and order" candidate. Thompson plays a fictional character on the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order franchise|Law and Order]]''. The people who make the comment are aware that ''Law and Order'' is fiction, but at some level, they may process fiction as if it were fact, a process included in what is called the Paradox of Fiction{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play.

A scientist might make a clear distinction between objects that exist, and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy. But in the layperson's [[worldview]], existence includes real, fictional, and even contradictory objects. Thus if we reason from the statement "[[Pegasus]] flies" to the statement "Pegasus exists", we are not asserting that Pegasus is made up of atoms, but rather that Pegasus exists in the worldview of classical myth. When a mathematician reasons from the statement "ABC is a triangle" to the statement "triangles exist", she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular [[mathematical model]].

==Modern approaches==
According to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Descriptions]], the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope: we distinguish between "some S is not P" (where negation takes "narrow scope") and "it is not the case that 'some S is P'" (where negation takes "wide scope"). The problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names. The sentences "Socrates is not bald" and "it is not the case that Socrates is bald" both appear to have the same meaning, and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (Socrates) who is not bald, so that negation takes a narrow scope. However, Russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem. According to Russell, Socrates can be analyzed into the form 'The Philosopher of Greece.' In the wide scope, this would then read: It is not the case that there existed a philosopher of Greece who was bald. In the narrow scope, it would read the Philosopher of Greece was not bald.

According to the [[Direct reference|direct-reference]] view, an early version of which was originally proposed by [[Bertrand Russell]], and perhaps earlier by [[Gottlob Frege]], a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers. This view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us ''which'' object bears the name, and thus to identify some object. But no object can be identified if none exists. Thus, a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful.

===Existence in the wide and narrow senses===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
According to the "two sense" view of existence, which derives from [[Alexius Meinong]], existential statements fall into two classes.

# Those asserting existence in a ''wide'' sense. These are typical of the form "N is P" for singular N, or "some S is P".
# Those asserting existence in a ''narrow'' sense. These are typical of the form "N exists" or "Ss exist".

The problem is then evaded as follows. "Pegasus flies" implies existence in the wide sense, for it implies that ''something'' flies. But it does not imply existence in the narrow sense, for we deny existence in this sense by saying that Pegasus does not exist. In effect, the world of all things divides, on this view, into those (like [[Socrates]], the planet [[Venus]], and New York City) that have existed in the narrow sense, and those (like [[Sherlock Holmes]], the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Minas Tirith]]) that do not.

However, common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] or places.

=== European views ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Influenced by the views of Brentano's pupil [[Alexius Meinong]], and by [[Edmund Husserl]], Germanophone and Francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence.

===Anti-realist arguments===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
[[Anti-realism]] is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world, maintaining either: (1) that nothing exists outside the [[mind]], or (2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist. Realists, in contrast, hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. An "anti-realist" who denies that other minds exist (i. e., a [[solipsist]]) is different from an "anti-realist" who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i. e., a logical [[behaviorist]]).

== Dharmic "middle way" view ==
The Indian philosopher [[Nagarjuna#Philosophy|Nagarjuna]] (c. 150–250 CE) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism.

In Eastern philosophy, [[Anicca]] (Sanskrit ''anitya'') or "[[impermanence]]" describes existence. It refers to the fact that all conditioned things ([[sankhara]]) are in a constant state of flux. In reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist; only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another. Imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes. While the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases, the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants. Buddhism teaches a middle way, avoiding the extreme views of [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel186.html | title=The Three Basic Facts of Existence |accessdate=2009-07-14| last=The Buddhist Publication Society | quote=(ref.1) Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, "this is lasting"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird's melody, the bee's hum, and a sunset's glory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist. The differences are reconciled in the concept of [[Shunyata]] by addressing the existing object's served purpose for the subject's identity in being. What exists is in non-existence, because the subject changes.

[[Trailokya]] elaborates on three kinds of existence, those of desire, form, and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths. Taken further to the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, it describes how the Buddha exists. In this philosophy, it is accepted that Buddha exists in more than one absolute way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6162">'''Fetal protection policies in the United States''' are various [[private sector]] rules intended to protect women's [[reproductive health]] and the health of developing [[fetus]]es in the workplace. These [[policies]] have evolved in response to the nature of many modern businesses, which use [[toxicity|toxic chemical]]s or [[ionizing radiation]] during ordinary business and production activities. These policies have also evolved based on the [[Civil law (common law)|liability]] a given business entity might incur, for example, for causing [[infertility|sterility]] or damage to an otherwise healthy fetus during pregnancy.

These policies were highlighted in the [[News media in the United States|national media]] in the early 1990s when the U.S. Supreme Court [[judicial review|reviewed]] a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|lower federal appellate court's]] decision in ''[[UAW v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">A '''''generic''''' or '''''universal''''' '''role-playing game system''' is a [[role-playing game system]] designed to be independent of [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] and [[genre]]. Its rules should, in theory, work the same way for any setting, world, environment or genre in which one would want to play.

==History==
The term "generic" has been used since the earliest days of gaming to describe a system that can be used for any type or style of game. There is some dispute among role-playing enthusiasts on when the concept of a generic system originated and which was the first one published.

According to Shannon Appelcline, [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (''BRP'', 1980), was the first generic role-playing system.&lt;ref name="bhotg3"&gt;{{cite web 
 | url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory3.phtml 
 | title=Brief History of the Game #3
 | accessdate=2007-09-14 
 | author=Shannon Appelcline 
 | date=2006-09-04 
 | publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''BRP'' was a "cut-down" version of Chaosium's ''[[RuneQuest]]'' role-playing game and formed the foundation for the ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' RPG, and was also adopted for ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', the first horror role-playing game.&lt;ref name="bhotg3"/&gt;  The publication of ''[[GURPS]]'' (''Generic Universal Role-Playing System'', 1986) as a completely setting-independent game and its commercial and creative success added credence to the movement. The development of the ''[[Hero System]]'' (1989) from the [[superhero]] role-playing game ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]''&lt;ref name="bhotg3"/&gt; also had a profound influence in popularizing the concept. 

It truly became a dominant subject in RPG design with the release of the Third Edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (2000) and the ''[[d20 System]]'' along with the creation of the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL).

'''Georges Besançon''' (1866–1934)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/000520243 University of Michigan library record]&lt;/ref&gt; founded and edited the aeronautical journal ''[[L'Aérophile]]''.

Besançon was a ballonist ("aeronaut") and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/trs/trslaerophile.html ''L'Aérophile'' Collection Overview, Science References Services of the Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;
Besançon helped train the later-celebrated balloonist [[Salomon Andrée]], probably in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Czech, Kenneth P. [http://www.historynet.com/swedish-led-artic-expedition-in-a-balloon-led-to-a-tragic-end.htm "Swedish-Led {{sic|Artic}} Expedition in a Balloon Led to a Tragic End" at historynet.com, originally from ''Aviation History'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Besançon and scientist [[Gustave Hermite]] sent instruments on fabric or paper balloons into the upper atmosphere for meteorological research.&lt;ref name="avstop.com"&gt;[http://avstop.com/balloon/earlyflight/early_scientific_balloons.htm "Early Scientific Balloons" at avstop.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1901, Hermite and Besançon sent up small instrumented rubber balloons that were designed to expand until at a high altitude they would burst. Then their instruments would descend by parachute.&lt;ref name="avstop.com"/&gt;

Besançon founded the aeronautical periodical ''[[L'Aérophile]]'' in 1893, and remained its director until at least 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/larophile18besa#page/n7/mode/2up ''L'Aérophile'', Jan 1, 1910 cover at archive.org scanned from Smithsonian Institution Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  There he covered and reported on the era in which the airplane was invented and an international airplane industry arose.

'''Gottfried Helnwein''' (born 8 October 1948) is an Austrian-Irish visual artist. He has worked as a painter, draftsman, photographer, muralist, sculptor, installation and performance artist, using a wide variety of techniques and media.

His work is concerned primarily with psychological and sociological anxiety, historical issues and political topics. His subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, particularly the wounded child, scarred physically and emotionally from within.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flynn Johnson, Curator of the San Francisco Fine Arts Museums, "The Child – Works by Gottfried Helnwein", essay for the catalogue of the one man show at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, {{ISBN|978-0-88401-112-5}}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His works often reference taboo and controversial issues from recent history, especially the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] and the horror of the [[Holocaust]]. As a result, his work is often considered provocative and controversial.

Helnwein studied at the [[University of Visual Art]] in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, [[Wien]]). He lives and works in Ireland and Los Angeles.

==Life==
Helnwein was born in [[Vienna]] shortly after World War II. His father Joseph Helnwein worked for the Austrian Post and Telegraphy administration (Österreichische Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung), and his mother Margarethe was a housewife.&lt;ref name="sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de"&gt;[http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41113/1/1 Sven Michaelsen, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, ''Ich kann mich in kein System einfügen'', 46/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3384-His-father-Joseph-Helnwein-works-in-the-Austrian-post-administration-and-his-mother-Margarethe-is-a-housewife?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - His father Joseph Helnwein works at the Austrian Post and Telegraph administration, his mother Margarethe is a housewife|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein spent his childhood in a strict Roman Catholic upbringing.  As a student he organized plays and art exhibitions at the  [[Sodality of Our Lady|Catholic Marian Society]] (Marianische Kongregation) of the [[Jesuit Church, Vienna|Jesuit University Church in Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3382-Strict-Roman-Catholic-upbringing?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Strict Roman Catholic upbringing|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3379-First-year-at-school-with-the-Roman-Catholic-School-Brothers?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - First year at school with the Roman Catholic "School-Brothers"|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1965 he enrolled at the  "Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation" in Vienna (Höhere Bundes-Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, Wien).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_878-1965-to-1969-Studies-at-the-Higher-Federal-Institution-for-Graphic-Education-and-Experimentation-in-Vienna-?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - 1965 to 1969  Studies at the "Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation" in Vienna|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years he started his first performances for small audiences where he cut his face and hands with razor blades and bandaged himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_1012-First-Aktions-for-small-audiences?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - First "Aktions" for small audiences|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 to 1973 he studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Wien).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_879-1969-to-1973-Helnwein-studies-painting-at-the-Academy-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vienna?s=1191&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Helnwein studies at the University of Visual Art in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Wien).|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Helnwein met [[Andy Warhol]] in his [[The Factory|Factory]] in New York City, who posed for a series of photo-sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_994-Helnwein-meets-with-Andy-Warhol-at-his-factory-in-New-York-?s=1190&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Helnwein meets with Andy Warhol at his factory in New York|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein was offered a chair by the University of Applied Sciences in [[Hamburg]] in 1982.  When his demand to admit also children to study at the university was rejected, he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Andreas Mackler talks with Gottfried Helnwein, 13. / 14. July and 21. / 22. September 1990, Verlag C.H.Beck, p.87, {{ISBN|3406340571}},[http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_994-Helnwein-meets-with-Andy-Warhol-at-his-factory-in-New-York-?s=1190&amp;sg=171 helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Rudolf Hausner]], recommended Helnwein as his successor as professor of the master-class for painting at the University of Visual Art in Vienna, but Helnwein left Vienna and moved to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hufnagel, Kurier, Wien, ''Akademie: Helnwein als Professor-ein Schock?'', Interview with Gottfried Helnwein, 13. Feb. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

He bought a medieval castle close to [[Cologne]] and the [[Rhine]]-river.  Four years later in 1989 he established a studio in [[Tribeca]] New York and thenceforth spent his time between the United States and Germany.&lt;ref name="sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Conrad III, San Francisco Chronicle, ''German Portraits of Pain, Gottfried Helnwein reminds Society of it's Past'', 9 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein moved to [[Dublin]], Ireland in 1997 and one year later, he bought [[Castle Gurteen de la Poer]] in [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Tipton, Irish Times, ''Fantasy and Reality in one Place’’, 4 June 2016 [http://www.helnwein.com/press/international_press/article_5765-Fantasy-and-Reality-in-one-Place helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 he established a studio in downtown Los Angeles and he lives and works since then in Ireland and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynell George, Los Angeles Times, ''Gottfried Helnwein - Dark Inspirations’’, 30 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2005, his friend [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Dita Von Teese]] were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at Helnwein's castle.&lt;ref&gt;Maeve Quigley, "Rocker ties Knot with Dita", ''Sunday Mirror'', UK, 4 December 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060828055104/http://www.gottfriedhelnwein.ie/country/ireland_special/artikel_2470.html Gottfried Helnwein | IRELAND | Ireland Special | ROCKER TIES KNOT WITH DITA]&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]&lt;ref&gt;''People magazine'', "Marilyn Manson Marries Girlfriend in Ireland", 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried Helnwein was [[best man]] &lt;ref&gt;The wedding ceremony, Dita and Manson at Castle De la Poer, Ireland 2005, Alejandro Jodorowsky officiates at the wedding, Helnwein is best man, www.helnwein.com [http://www.helnwein.com/kuenstler/atelier/bild_3713.html Gottfried Helnwein | ARTIST | Studio | Wedding ceremony, Dita and Manson at Castle De la Poer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamish Bowles, Steven Klein, "The Bride Wore Purple", [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], pages 546–556, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Helnwein is part of a tradition going back to the 18th century, to which [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt's]] grimacing sculptures belong. One sees, too, the common ground of his works with those of [[Arnulf Rainer]] and [[Hermann Nitsch]], two other Viennese, who display their own bodies in the frame of reference of injury, pain, and death. And one sees how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of [[Egon Schiele]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Recht, '{{lang|de|Der [[Untermensch]]}}', Gottfried Helnwein, one-man show, Musée d’Art Moderne, Strasbourg, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Child===
[[File:helnwein state russian museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|State [[Russian Museum]] St. Petersburg, Helnwein's ''Head of a Child'' ({{lang|de|"Kindskopf"}}, 1991, oil and acrylic on canvas, 600 x 400&amp;nbsp;cm), being installed in the retrospective of Gottfried Helnwein, 1997, (Collection of the State Russian Museum St. Petersburg)]]

Helnwein's early work consists mainly of hyper-realistic watercolors, depicting wounded children, as well as photographs and performances – often with children – in public spaces. The bandaged child became the most important figure next to the artist himself allied with him in his actions: the embodiment of the innocent, defenceless individual at the mercy of brute force.

Art historian Peter Gorsen specified the relation between Helnwein's work and [[Viennese Actionism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Helnwein must be set apart from Viennese Actionism as he does not reduce the child's body to mere aesthetic material (as in the "material actions" of [[Günter Brus]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], and [[Otto Muehl]]), but instead endows it with a symbolic function in representing defenceless, sacrificed man. The sexualistic concept of the child in ([[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]-influenced) Viennese Actionism is countered by the moralist and utopian Helnwein with the child as a sexless salvation figure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, "The Divided Self – Gottfried Helnwein in his Self-Portraits", "Der Untermensch", Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, The [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] organized the first one-person exhibition of Gottfried Helnwein at an American Museum: "The Child, works by Gottfried Helnwein" at the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nirmala Nataraj, "Gottfried Helnwein's The Child – Innocence Lost", ''SF Station'', San Francisco, 15 August 2004 [http://www.sfstation.com/gottfried-helnweins-the-child-a9 Gottfried Helnwein's The Child | SF Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry S. Parker III, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Helnwein, the child is the symbol of innocence, but also of innocence betrayed. In today's world, the malevolent forces of war, poverty, and sexual exploitation and the numbing, predatory influence of modern media assault the virtue of children.  Helnwein's work concerning the child includes paintings, drawings, and photographs, and it ranges from subtle inscrutability to scenes of stark brutality.
Of course, brutal scenes – witness The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] – have been important and regularly visited motifs in the history of art. What makes Helnwein's art significant is its ability to make us reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses. Many people feel that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.
The Child: Works by Gottfried Helnwein will inspire and enlighten many; it is also sure to upset some. It is not only the right but the responsibility of the museum to present art that deals with important and sometimes controversial topics in our society".&lt;ref&gt;Harry S.Parker III, Director of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, "The Child – Works by Gottfried Helnwein", Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show was seen by almost 130,000 visitors and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' quoted it the most important exhibition of a contemporary artist in 2004.
Steven Winn, ''Chronicle'' Arts and Culture critic, wrote: "Helnwein's large format, photo-realist images of children of various demeanors boldly probed the subconscious. Innocence, sexuality, victimization and haunting self-possession surge and flicker in Helnwein's unnerving work".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Winn, Chronicle Arts and Culture Critic, "Critics Choices 2004, Top Ten", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', 26 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self portraits===
At the same time when Helnwein painted watercolors of injured and abused children, from 1969, around 1970/71 he also began a series of self-portrayals in photographs and performances (actions) in his studio and in the streets of Vienna. 
Actionistic self-portrayals in the manner of a happening featuring his injured and bandaged body and surgical instruments deforming his face go back to Helnwein's student days. Since then, bandages have become part of the aesthetic "uniform" of his self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, ''Die Verwandlungskunst des Doppelgängers - zu den Selbstbildnissen bei Gottfried Helnwein'', ‘Der Untermensch’, Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, J&amp;V Verlag, Wien,  January 1988. {{ISBN|3-925835-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist exposed himself as victim and martyr: bandages around his head and forks and surgical instruments piercing his mouth or cheek. Frequently the distortions of these tormented images make it difficult to recognize Helnwein's face. He appears as a screaming man, mirroring the frightening aspects of life: a twentieth-century [[Man of Sorrows]]. His frozen cry, showing the artist in a state of implacable trauma, recalls [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''Scream'' and [[Francis Bacon]]'s screaming popes. 
Some of Helnwein's grimacing faces also recall the grotesque physiognomic distortions by the eighteenth-century Viennese sculptor Franz Xavier Messerschmidt. They could also be seen as part of the Austrian pictorial tradition that resurfaced in the perturbed and distorted expressionist faces painted by [[Kokoschka]] and Egon Schiele before World War I, reappearing in the exaggerated mimicry in Arnulf Rainer's "Face Farces."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selz, ''Helnwein - The Artist as Provocateur'', The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Palace Edition 1997,  pp. 11–98, {{ISBN|5900872556}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[William S. Burroughs]]  commented on Helnwein's self-portraits in an essay in 1992:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a basic misconception that any given face, at any given time, looks more or less the same, like a statue's face. Actually, the human face is as variable from moment to moment as a screen on which images are reflected, from within and from without.
Gottfried Helnwein's paintings and photographs attack this misconception, showing the variety of faces of which any face is capable. And in order to attack the basic misconception, he must underline and exaggerate by distortion, by bandages and metal instruments that force the face into impossible molds. Images of torture and madness abound, as happens from moment to moment in the face seen as a sensitive reflection of extreme perceptions and experience. How can a self-portrait depict statuesque calm in the face of the horrors that surround us all?&lt;ref&gt;William S. Burroughs, "Helnwein's Work",1990.''Helnwein Faces'', 1992 Edition Stemmle. {{ISBN|3-7231-0427-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central importance of the "self-portrait" in Helnwein's work, the mutable art of a [[doppelgänger]], is no accident. It becomes the projection surface of world events. "The artist doesn't make history, history makes him" ([[Auguste Comte]]). The artist's doppelgänger role as victim and perpetrator, martyr and [[satyr]], penitent and accuser, proxy and self-portrayer, moralist and autist, and in many other metamorphoses embodies and stages the antagonistic social forces on a stage of his inner-world consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, ''Die Verwandlungskunst des Doppelgängers - zu den Selbstbildnissen bei Gottfried Helnwein'', ‘Der Untermensch’, Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, 1988. {{ISBN|3-925835-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation with Robert A. Sobieszek, curator of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], Helnwein declared:
"The reason why I took up the subject of self-portraits and why I have put myself on stage was to function as a kind of representative for the suffering, abused and oppressed human being. I needed a living body to demonstrate and exemplify the effect of violence inflicted upon a defenseless victim.
There is nothing autobiographical or therapeutical about it, and I don’t think it says anything about me personally. 
Also I was the best possible model for my experiments: endlessly patient and always available."&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Sobieszek, ''Ghost in the Shell'', Photography and the Human Soul, 1850-2000, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics and trivial art===
Another strong element in his works are comics. Helnwein has sensed the superiority of [[cartoon]] life over real life ever since he was a child. Growing up in a dreary, destroyed post-war [[Vienna]], the young boy was surrounded by unsmiling people, haunted by a recent past they could never speak about. What changed his life was the first German-language [[Donald Duck]] comic book that his father brought home one day. Opening the book felt like finally arriving in a world where he belonged:&lt;br/&gt;
"...a decent world where one could get flattened by steam-rollers and perforated by bullets without serious harm. A world in which the people still looked proper, with yellow beaks or black knobs instead of noses." (Helnwein&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, "Memories of [[Duckburg]]", translation from German: "{{lang|de|Micky Maus unter dem roten Stern}}", ''Zeit-Magazin'', Hamburg, 12.May.1989. [http://www.helnwein.com/texte/selected_authors/artikel_398.html Gottfried Helnwein | TEXTS | Selected Authors | MEMORIES OF DUCKBURGAmerican Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Petra Halkes, "A Fable in Pixels and Paint – Gottfried Helnwein's American Prayer". Image &amp; Imagination, Le Mois de la Photo à Montréal, ''McGill-Queen's University Press'', 2005 ({{ISBN|978-0-7735-2969-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] presented Helnwein's painting "Mouse I" (1995, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210&amp;nbsp;cm x 310&amp;nbsp;cm) at the exhibition ''The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection''.&lt;br/&gt;
Alicia Miller commented on Helnwein's work in ''Artweek'':
"In 'The Darker Side of Playland', the endearing cuteness of beloved toys and cartoon characters turns menacing and monstrous. Much of the work has the quality of childhood nightmares. In those dreams, long before any adult understanding of the specific pains and evils that live holds, the familiar and comforting objects and images of a child's world are rent with something untoward. For children, not understanding what really to be afraid of, these dreams portend some pain and disturbance lurking into the landscape.
Perhaps nothing in the exhibition exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein's '[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as [[Mr. Hyde]], his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.
Helnwein's Mickey is painted in shades of gray, as if pictured on an old black-and-white TV set. We are meant to be transported to the flickering edges of our own childhood memories in a time imaginably more blameless, crime-less and guiltless. But Mickey's terrifying demeanor hints of things to come...".&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Miller, "The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection at SFMOMA", ''Artweek'', US, 1 November 2000. [http://www.helnwein.com/presse/local_press/artikel_272.html Gottfried Helnwein | PRESS | English Press | 'THE DARKER SIDE OF PLAYLAND: CHILDHOOD IMAGERY FROM THE LOGAN COLLECTION' AT SFMOMASFMOMA San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Helnwein's work is rooted in the legacy of [[German expressionism]], he has absorbed elements of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: "I learned more from [[Donald Duck]] than from all the schools that I have ever attended." Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein's work, [[Julia Pascal]] wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'': "His early watercolor ''Peinlich'' (''Embarrassing'')&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, ''Peinlich'', color pencil, india-ink, and watercolor on cardboard, 60 x 35cm, 1971 [http://www.helnweincomic.homestead.com/worksonpaper.html comic-helnwein]&lt;/ref&gt; shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book. Her innocent appeal is destroyed by the gash deforming her cheek and lips. It is as if Donald Duck had met [[Mengele]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julia |last=Pascal|authorlink=Julia Pascal|title= Nazi Dreaming|work= New Statesman, UK|date= 10 April 2006 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/164076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living between Los Angeles and Ireland, Helnwein met and photographed the [[Rolling Stones]] in London, and his portrait of [[John F. Kennedy]] made the front cover of [[Time magazine]] on the 20th anniversary of the president's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine Cover: John F. Kennedy, by Gottfried Helnwein, ''Time'' magazine, Vol. 122 No. 21, 14 November 1983 [http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19831114,00.html TIME Magazine Cover: John F.

Among his widely published works is a spoof of the famous [[Edward Hopper]] painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'', entitled ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'', depicting Elvis Presley, Marylin Monroe, James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. This painting also inspired the [[Green Day]] [[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|song]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Green Day: "American Idiots &amp; the New Punk Explosion", ''The Disinformation Company'', 2006, (Page 198), ({{ISBN|978-1-932857-32-0}}) [http://www.helnwein.com/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_2861.html Gottfried Helnwein | ARTIST | Bibliography | GREEN DAY: AMERICAN IDIOTS &amp; THE NEW PUNK EXPLOSION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining his imagery from the 1970s to the present, one sees influences as diverse as [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Goya]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Beuys]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], all filtered through a [[postwar]] Viennese childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Pascal, "Nazi Dreaming", ''New Statesman'', UK, 10 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 'Helnwein's oeuvre embraces total antipodes: The trivial alternates with visions of spiritual doom, the divine in the child contrasts with horror-images of child-abuse. But violence remains to be his basic theme – the physical and the emotional suffering, inflicted by one human being unto another.'&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fuller, {{lang|de|"Endzeit-Stimmung – Düstere Bilder in Goldener Zeit"}}, ''Du Mont Publishing House'', Cologne, 1994.

===References to the Holocaust===
[[File:Gh293.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Gottfried Helnwein, ''Epiphany I (Adoration of the Magi)'', mixed media on canvas, 1996]]
1988 in remembrance of [[Kristallnacht]] (Cristal Night) 50 years earlier, Helnwein erected a large installation in the city center of Cologne, between [[Ludwig Museum]] and the [[Cologne Cathedral]]: ''Selektion – Neunter November Nacht ("Selektion – Ninth November Night)''
A four-meter-high, hundred-meter-long picture lane in which the artist recalls the events of Reichskristallnacht, the actual beginning of the Holocaust, on 9 November 1938. He confronts the passersby with larger-than-life children's faces lined up in a seemingly endless row, as if for concentration camp selection. Just days into the exhibit, these portraits were vandalized by unknown persons, symbolically cutting the throats of the depicted children's faces. Helnwein consciously left the panels with the gashes and included them into the presentation, because he decided it made the work stronger and more relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Mischke, "Aefflinge und Tschandalen", ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 11. October 1988. [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/presse/selected_articles/artikel_213.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal, "Thoughts", Ninth November Night, Installation by Gottfried Helnwein, 09. November 1988 [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/texte/selected_authors/artikel_119.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell Waxman wrote 2004, in ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]'', Los Angeles: "The most powerful images that deal with Nazism and [[Holocaust]] themes are by [[Anselm Kiefer]] and Helnwein, although, Kiefer's work differs considerably from Helnwein's in his concern with the effect of German aggression on the national psyche and the complexities of German cultural heritage. Kiefer is known for evocative and soulful images of barren German landscapes. But Kiefer and Helnwein's work are both informed by the personal experience of growing up in a post-war German speaking country...
[[William Burroughs]] said that the American revolution begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein's art might have the capacity to instigate change by piercing the veil of political correctness to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Waxman, "The Helnwein Epiphany", ''The Jewish Journal'', Los Angeles, 23 July 2004 [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/presse/local_press/artikel_1746.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known paintings of Helnwein's oeuvre is [[Epiphany (holiday)|''Epiphany I'']] – ''Adoration of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]'', (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210&amp;nbsp;cm x 333&amp;nbsp;cm, collection of the Denver Art Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Grovier, Art since 1989, Thames &amp; Hudson, World of Art, London, 2015, {{ISBN|9780500204269}} [http://www.helnwein.com/artist/bibliography/article_5680-Art-since-1989?s=1159&amp;sg=166 helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a series of three paintings: ''Epiphany I'', ''Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds)'', ''Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple)'', created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. [[Julia Pascal]] wrote about this work in the New Statesman: "This Austrian Catholic [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen [[SS]] officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary's lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas." Helnwein's baby Jesus is often considered to represent [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helnwein.com/presse/local_press/artikel_2630.html Julia Pascal, "Nazi Dreaming", ''New Statesman'', UK, 10 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst them: "[[Macbeth]]" by [[William Shakespeare]], (director, choreographer: [[Johann Kresnik]]), Theater [[Heidelberg]], 1988, [[Volksbühne]] Berlin, 1995; "[[Marat/Sade|The Persecution and Murder of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade]]" by [[Peter Weiss]], (director: Johann Kresnik), [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|Stuttgart National Theatre]], 1989; "[[Pasolini]], Testament des Körpers", (director: Johann Kresnik), [[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]] [[Hamburg]], 1996; "Hamletmaschine" by [[Heiner Müller]], (director: Gert Hof), 47.

==Chronology==
{{prose|section|date=May 2015}}
* 1969–1973 He studied at the ''[[University of Visual Art]]'' in Vienna (''{{lang|de|Akademie der Bildenden Künste}}'', [[Wien]]).
* At that time he began to work on a series of hyper-realistic watercolour-paintings of bandaged and wounded children.
* 1971 First public Aktions in the streets of Vienna, often with bandaged children (Aktion ''Sorgenkind'', Aktion ''Hallo Dulder'', Aktion ''Eternal Youth'', Aktion ''Sandra'').&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, Aktion ''Sorgenkind'', Vienna, 1972, Works, www.helnwein.com [http://www.helnwein.com/werke/aktionen/bild_563.html Gottfried Helnwein | WORKS | Installations and Performances | Aktion Sorgekind]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the exhibition "Zoetus" at the Kunsthalle "Künstlerhaus" in Vienna, unidentified people put stickers with the words "[[Entartete Kunst]]" ([[degenerate art]]) on Helnwein's paintings.
* At the opening of a one-man show at Galerie D. in Moedling, near Vienna, the Major has Helnwein's Artworks confiscated by the police.
* 1972 An exhibition at the {{lang|de|"Galerie im Pressehaus"}} (Gallery of the House of the Press) is closed after 3 days because of strong protests and threats by the works council.
* 1979 Spurred into action by an interview in an Austrian tabloid in which the country's top court psychiatrist, Dr [[Heinrich Gross]], admitted killing children at Vienna's ''{{lang|de|[[Am Spiegelgrund]]}}'' Pediatric Unit during the war by poisoning their food, Helnwein painted ''Life not Worth Living'' – a watercolour of a little girl "asleep" on the table, her head in her plate. The painting was published in Austria's leading newsmagazine ''Profil'' and sparked a nationwide debate that finally led to Gross' appearing before a Vienna court. The judge ruled Gross was mentally unfit to be tried.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Connolly, "Helnwein, the man who used his own blood to paint Hitler", ''The Guardian'', UK, 16 May 2000 [http://www.helnwein.com/presse/international_press/artikel_19.html Gottfried Helnwein | PRESS | International Press | GOTTFRIED HELNWEIN, THE MAN WHO USED HIS OWN BLOOD TO PAINT HITLER] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031074618/http://www.helnwein.com/presse/international_press/artikel_19.html |date=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1982 Helnwein was offered a chair by the ''University of Applied Sciences'' in [[Hamburg]], which he declined.

* 1985 One man show at the [[Albertina, Vienna]].
* Besides his realistic work, Helnwein also began to develop abstract, expressive styles of painting during this period. He radically changes his way of working and now begins a series of large-format pictures consisting of several parts (diptychs, triptychs, poliptychs). In doing so he combines photomurals with abstract gestural and [[monochrome painting]] in oil and acrylic, also using reproductions of [[Caspar David Friedrich]] paintings and war documentary photographs which he assembles to form what Viennese art-critic Peter Gorsen calls "Bilderstrassen" (picture lanes).
* 1987 ''{{lang|de|[[Untermensch|Der Untermensch]]}}'', Gottfried Helnwein, self-portraits of from 1970–1987, one man show at the Musée d'Art Moderne in Strasbourg.

"Two days after the Sandy Hook school massacre, a survival gear company called Black Dragon Tactical composed a new slogan to promote sales of armored backpack inserts. "Arm the teachers," the company declared on Facebook. "In the meantime, bulletproof the kids... The question may be political, but the keenest response is to be found in a museum in Mexico City, the Museo Nacional de San Carlos, at a retrospective of paintings and photographs by the Austrian-American artist Gottfried Helnwein. Helnwein's extraordinary work depicts the fragile innocence of children. Devoid of grown-up sentimentalism, his images can be overwhelming, especially those that show how that innocence falters in an adult world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/12/28/the-true-impact-of-violence-on-childhood-why-every-american-ought-to-see-the-paintings-of-gottfried-helnwein/|title=The True Impact of Violence On Childhood?

==Quotes==
[[William Burroughs]] said of Helnwein:
:"It is the function of the artist to evoke the experience of surprised recognition: to show the viewer what he knows but does not know that he knows. Helnwein is a master of surprised recognition."&lt;ref&gt;"Helnwein Faces", 1992, Edition Stemmle, Switzerland, pages 6–7, {{ISBN|978-3-7231-0427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Helnwein is one of the few exciting painters we have today.''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Norman Mailer]]&lt;ref&gt;From a letter by Norman Mailer to Helnwein's wife Renate, written in Provincetown,
Massachusetts, 23 June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

''Well, the world is a haunted house, and Helnwein at times is our tour guide through it. In his work he is willing to take on the sadness, the irony, the ugliness and the beauty. But not all of Gottfried's work is on a canvas. A lot of it is the way he's approached life. And it doesn't take someone knowing him to know that. You take one look at the paintings and you say "this guy has been around." You can't sit in a closet – and create this. This level of work is earned.''&lt;br/&gt;[[Sean Penn]]&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Sean Penn in the documentary "Ninth November Night", a Film about Gottfried Helnwein and his Installation for the 50. Anniversary of "Kristallnacht" at Ludwig Museum in Cologne, 1988 and other references to the Holocaust in his Work. Director Henning Lohner, Los Angeles 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gottfried Helnwein is my mentor. His fight for expression and stance against oppression are reasons why I chose him as an artistic partner. An artist that doesn't provoke will be invisible. Art that doesn't cause strong emotions has no meaning. Helnwein has that internalized.''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Marilyn Manson]]&lt;ref&gt;"Ich bin Amerikas Alptraum", Interview by Christoph Dallach, Jörg Böckem, ''Der Spiegel'', Hamburg, 5 May 2003, page 178, [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-27007551.html?name=Ich+bin+Amerikas+Alptraum DER SPIEGEL&amp;nbsp;19/2003 – Ich bin Amerikas Alptraum]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Helnwein's subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, but not the carefree innocent child of popular imagination. Helnwein instead creates the profoundly disturbing yet compellingly provocative image of the wounded child. The child scarred physically and the child scarred emotionally from within.''&lt;br/&gt;

'''Guglielmo Janni''' (born 1892 - died 1958), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] belonging to the modern movement of the ''[[Scuola romana]] (Roman School)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. R. Lucchese, ''Guglielmo Janni'', [[Rome]] 1972. See also [http://www.scuolaromana.it/artisti/janni.htm Scheda dell'artista], on ''Scuolaromana.it''. Accessed 27/05/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Son of a renowned Roman family - his father Giuseppe was a lawyer and his mother Teresa Belli was the niece of famous [[Italian poetry|Italian poet]] [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] - Guglielmo Janni will be much influenced by his inherited literary background. He graduated at [[law]] in 1914 and, just after [[World War I]], he attended an [[Art Nouveau]] [[decorative arts|decorative]] course at the [[Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Rome]], while studying [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] on his own.

In 1921, he exhibited at the 1st [[Biennale]] of [[Rome]] and around 1924 he was called to decorate the Headquarters of the [[Banca d'Italia]], where he painted a [[mural]] on the history of [[Italy|Italian]] [[coin]]age. Between 1926 and 1927 he collaborated successively with the [[Ministry of the Interior]] and [[Ministry of Justice]], with the  [[Assicurazioni Generali|Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni]] and with [[Montecatini Terme]]. During this period (1923–1928), his main themes involved religious motifs and he exhibited his work at the II [[Biennale]] of [[Rome]]; at the Franciscan Art Contest of [[Milan]]; at the Art Show of the National Artists Association of [[Florence]]. Janni also became a lifelong friend of painter [[Alberto Ziveri]].

In 1928, Janni painted a [[fresco]] in the votive chapel of [[St. Bartholomew]] ("Monument to the Fallen") at [[Busseto]] ([[Parma]]), with influences from [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was congratulated by art critic [[Roberto Longhi]], who praised Janni's ''literary'' style of painting - an appropriate evaluation, as the artist's figurative work had acquired a "vocation to [[myth]]" that will be reflected in all his subsequent work: he will convey it through a tormented and sensual contemplation of the virile form, often concealed by an ambiguous and mundane veil:&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see his ''Pugile (Boxer)''[http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope111.htm], ''Pesi e trapezi (Weights and Trapezes)'' [http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope112.htm], ''Commedia dell'arte (Comedy of Art)''[http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope114.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; his "[[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]" of 1931 confirms this fully.&lt;ref&gt;This painting was exhibited in 1934 at the ''Exhibition of Contemporary Italian Painting'' of [[Baltimore]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] presented in a relevant catalogue, Janni's first personal [[art exhibition|exhibition]] at the [[Galleria della Cometa]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.scuolaromana.it/document/doc149.htm ''Catalogo della personale di Guglielmo Janni''], published in 1935 by Galleria della Cometa&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rome]] in 1936, where many important paintings were displayed, among which: ''Figura d'aprile, Giovani atleti, Lo specchio, Figura di Balletto''. Highly acclaimed by public and art critics, he organised again at the same Gallery a second personal exhibition and, in 1936, he attended the [[Biennale di Venezia]] and displayed three paintings at the Modern Italian Art Expo of [[Budapest]].

After a visit to the [[Universal Exposition]] of [[Paris]] with [[Alberto Ziveri]] in 1937, Janni suffered an existential crisis and abandoned [[painting]] completely. He then decided to dedicate the rest of his life to studying, editing and cataloguing his grandfather [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli|Belli's]] unpublished writings, stored in the family library. Janni died while doing this labouring work, which included a monumental biographical opus on Belli's life and poetry, in ten volumes.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Marcel Proust|Proustian]] style, Janni kept revising and rewriting whole chapters of his Belli biography, never satisfied with the final result. This work was published posthumously in 1967, condensed into 3 volumes, and edited by R. Lucchese ([[Milan]]).

A '''guilty pleasure''' is something, such as a film, a television program or a piece of music, that one enjoys despite understanding that it is not generally held in high regard, or is seen as unusual or weird. For example, a person may secretly like a movie but will admit that particular movie is poorly made and/or generally seen as "not good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/loves-evolver/201005/why-its-good-feel-guilty|title=Why It's Good to Feel Guilty|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=May 14, 2010|first=Maryanne|last=Fisher|work=[[Psychology Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/against-guilty-pleasure|title=Against "Guilty Pleasure"|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Szalai|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fashion]], [[video game]]s, [[music]], [[theatre]], [[television series]], [[Movie|films]], [[food]] and [[fetishes]] can be examples of guilty pleasures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13911">The '''Gutmann method''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[data remanence|securely erasing]] the contents of computer [[hard disk drive]]s, such as [[computer file|file]]s. Devised by [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] and Colin Plumb and presented in the paper ''Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory'' in July 1996, it involved writing a series of 35 [[pattern]]s over the region to be erased.

The selection of patterns assumes that the user does not know the encoding mechanism used by the drive, so it includes patterns designed specifically for three types of drives. A user who knows which type of encoding the drive uses can choose only those patterns intended for their drive. A drive with a different encoding mechanism would need different patterns.

Most of the patterns in the Gutmann method were designed for older [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]/[[Run Length Limited|RLL]] encoded disks. Gutmann himself has noted that more modern drives no longer use these older encoding techniques, making parts of the method irrelevant. He said "In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques".&lt;ref name="Gutmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name=security-and-usability&gt;{{cite book |title=Security and Usability: Designing Secure Systems that People Can Use |authors=Lorrie Faith Cranor, Simson Garfinkel |page=307 |url=https://books.google.ee/books?id=wDVhy9EyEAEC&amp;pg=PA307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2001, some [[Parallel ATA|ATA IDE]] and [[SATA]] hard drive manufacturer designs include support for the [[ATA Secure Erase]] standard, obviating the need to apply the Gutmann method when erasing an entire drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|title=Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303210956/http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-03|publisher=Communications Security Establishment|date=July 2006|page=7|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2011 research found that 4 out of 8 manufacturers did not implement ATA Secure Erase correctly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical overview==
One standard way to recover data that has been overwritten on a hard drive is to capture and process the analog signal obtained from the drive's read/write head prior to this analog signal being digitized. This analog signal will be close to an ideal digital signal, but the differences will reveal important information. By calculating the ideal digital signal and then subtracting it from the actual analog signal, it is possible to amplify the obtained difference signal and use it to determine what had previously been written on the disk.

For example:
 Analog signal:        +11.1  -8.9  +9.1 -11.1 +10.9  -9.1
 Ideal digital signal: +10.0 -10.0 +10.0 -10.0 +10.0 -10.0
 Difference:            +1.1  +1.1  -0.9  -1.1  +0.9  +0.9
 Previous signal:      +11    +11   -9   -11    +9    +9

This can then be done again to see the previous data written:
 Recovered signal:     +11    +11   -9   -11    +9    +9
 Ideal digital signal: +10.0 +10.0 -10.0 -10.0 +10.0 +10.0
 Difference:            +1    +1    +1    -1    -1    -1
 Previous signal:      +10   +10   +10   -10   -10   -10

However, even when overwriting the disk repeatedly with random data it is theoretically possible to recover the previous signal. The  [[permittivity]] of a medium changes with the frequency of the magnetic field{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. This means that a lower frequency field will penetrate deeper into the magnetic material on the drive than a high frequency one{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. So a low frequency signal will, in theory, still be detectable even after it has been overwritten hundreds of times by a high frequency signal.

The patterns used are designed to apply alternating magnetic fields of various frequencies and various phases to the drive surface and thereby approximate [[degaussing]] the material below the surface of the drive{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

==Method==
An [[overwrite]] session consists of a lead-in of four [[random]] write patterns, followed by patterns 5 to 31 (see rows of table below), executed in a random order, and a lead-out of four more random patterns.

Each of patterns 5 to 31 was designed with a specific [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]] [[code|encoding]] scheme in mind, which each pattern targets. The drive is written to for all the passes even though the table below only shows the bit patterns for the passes that are specifically targeted at each encoding scheme. The end result should obscure any data on the drive so that only the most advanced physical scanning (e.g., using a [[magnetic force microscope]]) of the drive is likely to be able to recover any data. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Encoded bits shown in bold are what should be present in the ideal pattern, although due to the encoding the complementary bit is actually present at the start of the track.

==Criticism==

The delete function in most [[operating systems]] simply marks the space occupied by the file as reusable (removes the [[data pointer|pointer]] to the file) without immediately removing any of its contents. At this point the file can be fairly easily recovered by numerous recovery applications.  However, once the space is overwritten with other data, there is no known way to use software to recover it. It cannot be done with software alone since the storage device only returns its current contents via its normal interface.  Gutmann claims that [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] have sophisticated tools, including [[magnetic force microscope]]s, which together with [[image analysis]], can detect the previous values of [[bit]]s on the affected area of the media (for example [[hard disk]]).

Daniel Feenberg of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], an American private nonprofit research organization, criticized Gutmann's claim that intelligence agencies are likely to be able to read overwritten data, citing a lack of evidence for such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/sys-admin/overwritten-data-gutmann.html|title=Can Intelligence Agencies Read Overwritten Data? A response to Gutmann|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=2013|orig-year=2003|author=Daniel Feenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some published government security procedures consider a disk overwritten once to still be sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|title=Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303210956/http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-03|publisher=Communications Security Establishment|date=July 2006|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutmann himself has responded to some of these criticisms and also criticized how his algorithm has been abused in an epilogue to his original paper, in which he states:&lt;ref name="Gutmann"&gt;Gutmann, Peter. (July 22–25, 1996) ''[https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory.]'' University of Auckland Department of Computer Science. Epilogue section.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=security-and-usability /&gt;
{{quotation|In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques. As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to [[Partial response maximum likelihood|PRML]] and EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple scrubbing with random data. In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] methods (if you don't understand that statement, re-read the paper). If you're using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes. For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few passes of random scrubbing is the best you can do. As the paper says, "A good scrubbing with random data will do about as well as can be expected". This was true in 1996, and is still true now.|Peter Gutmann|Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory|University of Auckland Department of Computer Science.}}

A '''Hovmöller diagram''' is a commonly used way of [[Graph of a function|plotting]] [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data to highlight the role of [[wave]]s.  The [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] of a Hovmöller diagram are typically [[longitude]] or [[latitude]] (abscissa or x-axis) and time (ordinate or y-axis) with the value of some [[Field (physics)|field]] represented through color or shading.  Hovmöller diagrams are also used to plot the time evolution of vertical profiles of scalar quantities such as [[temperature]], [[density]], or concentrations of constituents in the [[atmosphere]] or [[ocean]]. In that case time is plotted along the [[abscissa]] and vertical position (depth, height, pressure) along the ordinate.

The diagram first introduced by Ernest Aabo Hovmöller (1912-2008), a [[Danish people|Danish]] meteorologist, in a paper of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Hubris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|b|r|ɪ|s}} from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὕβρις|ὕβρις]]}}) describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish [[pride]] or dangerous [[confidence|overconfidence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hubris|title=Definition of HUBRIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in combination with (or synonymous with) '''arrogance'''.&lt;ref name="Picone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Picone, P. M., Dagnino, G. B., &amp; Minà, A.|title=. The origin of failure: A multidisciplinary appraisal of the hubris hypothesis and proposed research agenda|journal=The Academy of Management Perspectives|date=2014|volume=28 |issue=4|pages=447–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its [[ancient Greek]] context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the [[Deity|gods]], and which in turn brings about the downfall, or [[nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]], of the perpetrator of hubris.

The adjectival form of the noun ''hubris'' is "hubristic". Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the wrongful act. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. 

== Ancient Greek origin ==

===Common use===

In [[ancient Greek]], ''hubris'' referred to actions that shamed and humiliated the victim for the pleasure or gratification of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, "Law, society and homosexuality or hermaphrodity in Classical Athens" in ''Studies in ancient Greek and Roman society'' By Robin Osborne; p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The term had a strong sexual connotation, and the shame reflected upon the perpetrator as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society |last= Cartledge|first= |authorlink= Paul Cartledge |author2=Paul Millett |year= 2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-52209-0|page= 123 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3nCSw5Cr4PUC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate= 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of the law against hubris included what might today be termed [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]; sexual crimes; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first [[Midias]] punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (''[[Against Midias]]''), and second when (in ''Against Conon'') a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of hubris appears in [[Aeschines]]' ''[[Against Timarchus]]'', where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of hubris by submitting himself to [[prostitution]] and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines "Against Timarchus" from Thomas K. Hubbard's ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Athens, hubris was defined as the use of violence to shame the victim (this sense of hubris could also characterize rape&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubris|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for that committer's own gratification:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1378b ''Rhetoric'' 1378b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=No mention of Hubris on page cited nor found in 'Rhetoric' on the Tufts site|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eros&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&amp;pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of [[honour]] (τιμή, ''timē'') and shame (αἰδώς, ''[[aidos|aidōs]]''). The concept of honour included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition of hubris to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rehm |first1=Rush |title=Radical Theatre: Greek Tragedy in the Modern World |date=2014 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |location=Google Books |isbn=9781472502339 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8eanAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Rush+Rehm+hubris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nz5iuQGTqX&amp;sig=0nlp6Yu745vHrOc_DTDlv-KVVGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUiL_1zubdAhUr94MKHUWUDgUQ6AEwCXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rush%20Rehm%20hubris&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious use===

The Greek word for sin, [[hamartia]] (ἁμαρτία), originally meant "error" in the ancient dialect, and so poets like [[Hesiod]] and [[Aeschylus]] used the word "hubris" to describe transgressions against the gods. &lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris "Hubris"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; A common way that hubris was committed was when a mortal claimed to be better than a god in a particular skill or attribute. Claims like these were rarely left unpunished, and so [[Arachne]], a talented young weaver, was transformed into a spider when she said that her skills exceeded those of the goddess [[Athena]]. Additional examples include [[Icarus]], [[Phaethon]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Niobe]], [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Tereus]].

These events were not limited to myth, and certain figures in history were considered to be have been punished for committing hubris through their arrogance. One such person was king [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] as portrayed in Aeschylus's play [[The_Persians|The Persians]], and who allegedly threw chains to [[Xerxes%27_Pontoon_Bridges|bind the Hellespont]] sea as punishment for daring to destroy his fleet.

What is common to all these examples is the breaching of limits, as the Greeks believed that the [[Moirai|Fates]] (Μοῖραι) had assigned each being with a particular area of freedom, an area that even the gods could not breach. &lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Castoriadis. Ce qui fait la Grèce, tome 1: D'Homère à Héraclite, chapitre V. Editeur: Seuil (9 mars 2004). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation===

The goddess [[Hybris (mythology)|Hybris]] has been described as having "insolent encroachment upon the rights of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Themis |volume=26 |page=758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Testament ==

The word hubris as used in the New Testament parallels the Hebrew word ''pasha'', meaning transgression. It represents a sense of false pride that makes a man defy God, sometimes to the degree that he considers himself an equal. In contrast to this, the common word for sin was [[hamartia]], which refers to an error and reflects the complexity of the human condition. Its result is guilt rather than direct punishment as in the case of hubris &lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz. Theology for the Community of God, [https://books.google.es/books?id=NAPrXVh_56wC&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=hubris&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=hubris&amp;f=false], Pub: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Modern usage ==
In its modern usage, hubris denotes overconfident pride combined with arrogance.&lt;ref name="Picone"/&gt; Hubris is often associated with a lack of [[humility]]. Sometimes a person's hubris is also associated with ignorance. The accusation of hubris often implies that suffering or punishment will follow, similar to the occasional pairing of hubris and [[Nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]] in Greek mythology. The proverb "pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall" (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18) is thought to sum up the modern use of hubris. Hubris is also referred to as "pride that blinds" because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830/The_1920_Farrows_Bank_Failure_A_Case_of_Managerial_Hubris|publisher=Durham University |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, "that pride that goes just before the fall."

Examples of hubris are often found in literature, most famously in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which [[Lucifer]] attempts to compel the other angels to worship him, is cast into hell by God and the innocent angels, and proclaims: "Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven." Victor in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' manifests hubris in his attempt to become a great scientist; he creates life through technological means, but comes to regret his project. [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' portrays the eponymous character as a scholar whose arrogance and pride compel him to sign a [[deal with the Devil]], and retain his haughtiness until his death and damnation, despite the fact that he could easily have repented had he chosen to do so.

An example in pop culture is the comic book hero [[Doctor Strange]], wherein highly talented and arrogant [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Dr. Stephen Strange is involved in a vehicular accident. Unlike the Greek figures Salmoneus, Icarus and Phaethon, he survives, though his hands are severely damaged, and thus his career as a neurosurgeon is shattered. After western medicine fails to help him, he seeks healing in the mystic arts, and though he never fully recovers, he becomes a powerful sorcerer.

A historical example of hubris was furnished by [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in the decisions that culminated in the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]; Custer is apocryphally quoted as having exclaimed: "Where did all those damned Indians come from?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Where+did+all+those+damned+indians+come+from&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=52FAdoZNxG&amp;sig=Zm4zGjSr68YddlyMEx3KqWHbrac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI9MeE0__iyAIVAX0mCh2S1ATy#v=onepage&amp;q=Where%20did%20all%20those%20damned%20indians%20come%20from&amp;f=false |title=The Words of Others: From Quotations to Culture |first1=Gary Saul |last1=Morson |page=176 |isbn=9780300167474 |location=New Haven.

[[C. S. Lewis]] wrote in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the [[wikt:ego#English|ego]] and the self are directly opposed to [[God]]: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mere Christianity : a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |year=2001 |first1=C.S. |last1=Lewis |authorlink1=C.S.

==Overview==
Ignorance Management has been described by John Israilidis, Russell Lock, and Louise Cooke of [[Loughborough University]] as:

{{quote|"[...] a [[Business process|process]] of discovering, exploring, realising, recognising and managing ignorance outside and inside the organisation through an appropriate management process to meet current and future demands, design better policy and modify actions in order to achieve organisational [[Goal|objectives]] and sustain [[competitive advantage]]."&lt;ref&gt;Israilidis, J.; Lock, R.; Cooke, L. (2012) Ignorance Management: An Alternative Perspective on Knowledge Management in Multinational Organisations. In ''Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Knowledge Management'', Cartagena, Spain, 6–7 September, pp.493-501, {{ISBN|978-1-908272-63-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The key principle of this [[theory]] is that knowledge management (KM) could better be seen as Ignorance Management due to the fact that it is impossible for someone to comprehend and understand everything in a complete way. The only real wisdom is in recognising the limits and extent of one's [[knowledge]] and therefore, KM is essentially a matter of sharing the extent of one's ignorance with other people, and thus learning together. This process of knowing what is needed to know and also acknowledging the power of understanding the [[Unknown known|unknown]], could develop a [[Tacit knowledge|tacit]] understanding and could improve both short-term opportunistic value capture and longer term business sustainability (Israilidis et al. 2012).

==Research==
Several attempts have been made to explore the value of managing organisational ignorance in order to prevent failures within [[knowledge transfer]] contexts. The need to recognise the role and significance of power in the management of ignorance has been introduced to further enhance such efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J. (2009) From Knowledge Management to Ignorance Management. In ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Organizational Learning Knowledge and Capabilities'', Amsterdam, Netherlands, 26–28 April.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a growing body of psychology research shows that humans find it intrinsically difficult to get a sense of what we don’t know and argues that incompetence deprives people of the ability to recognise their own incompetence (the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wolchover, N. (2012) [https://news.yahoo.com/incompetent-people-too-ignorant-know-175402902.html Incompetent People Too Ignorant to Know It]. Retrieved 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the viewpoint of developing our understanding of organisational ignorance can yield impressive benefits, if successfully incorporated within a company’s KM strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zack, M. (1999) Managing Organizational Ignorance. ''Knowledge Directions'', Volume 1, pp. 36-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[software engineering]], '''inversion of control''' ('''IoC''') is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a [[computer program]] receive the [[control flow|flow of control]] from a generic [[Software framework|framework]]. A [[software architecture]] with this design inverts control as compared to traditional [[procedural programming]]: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program [[function call#Main concepts|calls]] into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.

Inversion of control is used to increase [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] of the program and make it [[Extensible programming|extensible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.laputan.org/drc/drc.html | title=Designing Reusable Classes | publisher=Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | work=Journal of Object-Oriented Programming, Volume 1, Number 2 | date=June–July 1988 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Ralph E. Johnson &amp; Brian Foote | pages=22–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in [[object-oriented programming]] and other [[programming paradigm]]s. The term was used by Michael Mattsson in a thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Mattsson/publication/2238535_Object-Oriented_Frameworks/links/54d0a8ed0cf298d65667af54.pdf | title=Object-Oriented Frameworks, A survey of methodological issues | author=Michael Mattsson |  date=Feb 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;, taken from there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/38/ | title=On Inversion of Control | date=Jan 22, 2004 | author=Stefano Mazzocchi | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202120126/http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/38/ | archivedate=2 February 2004 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stefano Mazzocchi and popularized by him in 1999 in a defunct Apache Software Foundation project, [[Apache Avalon|Avalon]], then further popularized in 2004 by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] and [[Martin Fowler]].

The term is related to, but different from, the [[dependency inversion principle]], which concerns itself with [[Dependency (computer science)|decoupling dependencies]] between [[high- and low-level|high-level and low-level]]  [[Abstraction layer|layers]] through shared [[Abstraction (computing)|abstractions]]. The general concept is also related to [[event-driven programming]] in that it is often implemented using IoC, so that the custom code is commonly only concerned with the handling of events, whereas the [[event loop]] and dispatch of events/messages is handled by the framework or the runtime environment.

== Overview ==
As an example, with traditional programming, the [[main function]] of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available [[Command (computing)|commands]] and query the user to select one.&lt;ref name=FowlerDI/&gt; The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in [[text based interface]]s. For example, an [[email client]] may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command.

With inversion of control, on the other hand, the program would be written using a [[software framework]] that knows common behavioral and graphical elements, such as [[windowing system]]s, menus, controlling the mouse, and so on. The custom code "fills in the blanks" for the framework, such as supplying a table of menu items and registering a code subroutine for each item, but it is the framework that monitors the user's actions and invokes the subroutine when a menu item is selected. In the mail client example, the framework could follow both the keyboard and mouse inputs and call the command invoked by the user by either means, and at the same time monitor the [[network interface]] to find out if new messages arrive and refresh the screen when some network activity is detected. The same framework could be used as the skeleton for a spreadsheet program or a text editor. Conversely, the framework knows nothing about Web browsers, spreadsheets or text editors; implementing their functionality takes custom code.

Inversion of control carries the strong connotation that the reusable code and the problem-specific code are developed independently even though they operate together in an application. [[Software framework]]s, [[Callback (computer programming)|callback]]s, [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]]s, [[event loop]]s, [[dependency injection]], and the [[template method]] are examples of [[design pattern]]s that follow the inversion of control principle, although the term is most commonly used in the context of [[object-oriented programming]].

Inversion of control serves the following design purposes:
* To [[Object decoupling|decouple]] the execution of a task from implementation.
* To focus a module on the task it is designed for.
* To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on [[design by contract|contracts]].
* To prevent [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s when replacing a module.

Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the "Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you".

== Background ==

Inversion of control is not a new term in computer science. [[Martin Fowler]] traces the etymology of the phrase back to 1988,&lt;ref name=FowlerIoC&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html Inversion of Control] on Martin Fowler's Bliki&lt;/ref&gt; but it is closely 
related to the concept of '''program inversion''' described by [[Michael A. Jackson|Michael Jackson]] in his [[Jackson Structured Programming]] methodology in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jacksonworkbench.co.uk/stevefergspages/papers/ourusoff--introduction_to_jackson_design_method.pdf | title=Introduction to Jackson Design Method}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bottom-up parsing|bottom-up parser]] can be seen as an inversion of a [[Top-down parsing|top-down parser]]: in the one case, the 
control lies with the parser, in the other case, it lies with the receiving application.

[[Dependency injection]] is a specific type of IoC.&lt;ref name=FowlerDI&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Dependency Injection].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Service locator pattern|service locator]] such as the [[Java Naming and Directory Interface]] (JNDI) is similar. In an article by Loek Bergman,&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://loekbergman.nl/InsideArchitecture/TheVision/InversionOfControl |date=* }} Inside Architecture: write once, run anywhere by Loek Bergman&lt;/ref&gt; it is presented as an architectural principle.

In an article by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]],&lt;ref name="robertmartin"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041221102842/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf The Dependency Inversion principle] by Robert C. Martin&lt;/ref&gt; the dependency inversion principle and abstraction by layering come together. His reason to use the term "inversion" is in comparison with traditional software development methods. He describes the uncoupling of services by the abstraction of layers when he is talking about dependency inversion. The principle is used to find out where system borders are in the design of the abstraction layers.

== Description ==

In traditional programming, the [[control flow|flow]] of the [[business logic]] is determined by objects that are [[Static binding|statically bound]] to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions that are defined through abstractions. This [[Late binding|run-time binding]] is achieved by mechanisms such as [[dependency injection]] or a [[Service locator pattern|service locator]]. In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from [[Configuration file|external configuration]] instead of with a direct reference in the code itself.

In dependency injection, a dependent [[object-oriented programming|object]] or module is coupled to the object it needs at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at [[compile time]] using [[static code analysis|static analysis]]. While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides [[object-oriented programming]].

In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible [[Software interface|interfaces]]. For example, class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; may delegate behavior to interface &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; which is implemented by class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;; the program instantiates &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, and then injects &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.

== Implementation techniques ==

In [[object-oriented programming]], there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:
* Using a [[service locator pattern]]
* Using [[dependency injection]], for example
** Constructor injection
** Parameter injection
** Setter injection
** Interface injection
* Using a contextualized lookup
* Using [[template method design pattern]]
* Using [[strategy design pattern]]

In an original article by Martin Fowler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern] by Martin Fowler&lt;/ref&gt; the first three different techniques are discussed. In a description about inversion of control types,&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/IoC+Types IoC Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615045650/http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/IoC+Types |date=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last one is mentioned. Often the contextualized lookup will be accomplished using a service locator

==Examples==
Most frameworks such as [[.NET Framework|.NET]] or [[Enterprise Java]] display this pattern:

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
public class ServerFacade {
   public &lt;K, V&gt; V respondToRequest(K request) {
      if (businessLayer.validateRequest(request)) {
         DAO.getData(request);
         return Aspect.convertData(request);
      }
      return null;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This basic outline in Java gives an example of code following the IoC methodology. It is important, however, that in the {{Java|ServerFacade}} a lot of assumptions are made about the data returned by the [[data access object]] (DAO).

Although all these assumptions might be valid at some time, they couple the implementation of the {{Java|ServerFacade}} to the DAO implementation. Designing the application in the manner of inversion of control would hand over the control completely to the DAO object. The code would then become

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
public class ServerFacade {
   public &lt;K, V&gt; V respondToRequest(K request, DAO dao) {
      return dao.getData(request);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The example shows that the way the method {{Java|respondToRequest}} is constructed determines if IoC is used. It is the way that parameters are used that define IoC. This resembles the [[Message Passing|message-passing]] style that some object-oriented programming languages use.

The '''is–ought problem''', as articulated by the Scottish [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] [[David Hume]] (1711–76), states that many writers make claims about what ''ought'' to be, based on statements about what ''is''. Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between [[Positive statement|positive]] statements (about what is) and prescriptive or [[normative]] statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones. The is–ought problem is also known as '''Hume's law''', '''Hume's guillotine''' or '''fact–value gap'''.

A similar view is defended by [[G. E. Moore]]'s [[open-question argument]], intended to refute any identification of [[moral]] properties with natural [[properties]]. This so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]] stands in contrast to the views of [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]].

==Overview==
Hume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his book, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739):

{{quote|In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, ''is'', and ''is not'', I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ''ought'', or an ''ought not''. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ''ought'', or ''ought not'', expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|chapter=Section 1|wslink=Treatise of Human Nature/Book 3: Of morals/Part 1|plaintitle=Treatise of Human Nature|last= Hume |first= David |authorlink = David Hume |year=|publisher=|page=469-470|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hume |first = David |authorlink = David Hume |title = A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sp8B0ZdyAYC&amp;pg=PA335#v=snippet&amp;q=%22every%20system%20of%20morality%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-12-06 |year = 1739 |publisher = John Noon |location= London |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!-- Please note before you "fix" it, that the preceding is a direct quote and that the words used in the text are so abbreviated --&gt;

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hume asks, given knowledge of the way the universe ''is'', in what sense can we say it ''ought to be'' different? (photograph, ''[[Earthrise]]'')]]Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly ''can'' an "ought" be derived from an "is"? The question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Priest |title=The British Empiricists |pages=177–78 |publisher=Routledge |location= |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-35723-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complete severing of "is" from "ought" has been given the graphic designation of ''Hume's Guillotine''.&lt;ref name="Black1964"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Max|title=The Gap Between "Is" and "Should"|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|issue=2|year=1964|page=165|issn=0031-8108|doi=10.2307/2183334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The apparent gap between "is" statements and "ought" statements, when combined with [[Hume's fork]], renders "ought" statements of dubious validity. Hume's fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the is–ought problem holds, then "ought" statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge. [[Moral skepticism]] and [[non-cognitivism]] work with such conclusions.

==Responses==

===Oughts and goals===
[[File:Alonzo Babers finish.JPEG|thumb|left|150px|Few debate that one ''ought'' to run quickly ''if'' one's goal is to win a race. A tougher question may be whether one "morally ought" to want to win a race in the first place.]]
[[Ethical naturalists]] contend that moral truths exist, and that their truth value relates to facts about physical reality. Many modern naturalistic philosophers see no impenetrable barrier in deriving "ought" from "is", believing it can be done whenever we analyze goal-directed behavior. They suggest that a statement of the form ''"In order for agent ''A'' to achieve goal ''B'', ''A'' reasonably ought to do ''C''"'' exhibits no [[category error]] and may be factually verified or refuted. "Oughts" exist, then, in light of the existence of goals. A counterargument to this response is that it merely pushes back the 'ought' to the subjectively valued 'goal' and thus provides no fundamentally objective basis to one's goals which, consequentially, provides no basis of distinguishing moral value of fundamentally different goals. A possible basis for an objective, moral realist, morality might be an appeal to [[teleonomy]].

This is similar to work done by moral philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who attempts to show that because ethical language developed in the West in the context of a belief in a human [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]—an end or goal—our inherited moral language, including terms such as good and bad, have functioned, and function, to evaluate the way in which certain behaviors facilitate the achievement of that telos. In an evaluative capacity, therefore, good and bad carry moral weight without committing a category error. For instance, a pair of scissors that cannot easily cut through paper can legitimately be called bad since it cannot fulfill its purpose effectively. Likewise, if a person is understood as having a particular purpose, then behaviour can be evaluated as good or bad in reference to that purpose. In plainer words, a person is acting good when that person fulfills that person's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacIntyre |first=Alasdair |title=After Virtue: A Study in Moral Philosophy |location=Notre Dame, IN |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |year=1981 |pages=148–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the concept of an "ought" is meaningful, this need not involve morality. This is because some goals may be morally neutral, or (if they exist) against what is moral. A poisoner might realize his victim has not died and say, for example, "I ought to have used more poison," since his goal is to murder. The next challenge of a moral realist is thus to explain what is meant by a "''moral'' ought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |title=The Concept of Law |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discourse ethics===
{{Main article|Discourse ethics}}
Proponents of discourse ethics argue that the very act of discourse implies certain "oughts", that is, certain [[presupposition]]s that are necessarily accepted by the participants in discourse, and can be used to further derive prescriptive statements. They therefore argue that it is incoherent to argumentatively advance an ethical position on the basis of the is–ought problem, which contradicts these implied assumptions.

====Moral oughts====
As MacIntyre explained, someone may be called a good person if people have an inherent purpose. Many ethical systems appeal to such a purpose. This is true of some forms of [[moral realism]], which states that something can be wrong, even if every thinking person ''believes'' otherwise (the idea of [[brute fact]] about morality). The ethical realist might suggest that humans were created for a purpose (e.g. to serve God), especially if they are an [[ethical non-naturalist]]. If the ethical realist is instead an [[ethical naturalist]], they may start with the fact that humans have [[evolved]] and pursue some sort of [[evolutionary ethics]] (which risks “committing” the [[moralistic fallacy]]).
Not all moral systems appeal to a human telos or purpose. This is because it is not obvious that people even ''have'' any sort of natural purpose, or what [[Teleology|that purpose]] would be. Although many scientists do recognize [[teleonomy]] (a tendency in nature), few philosophers appeal to it (this time, to avoid the naturalistic fallacy).

[[File:The Posts - geograph.org.uk - 116024.jpg|thumb|Even if oughts can be understood in relation to goals or needs, the greater challenge of ethical systems remains that of defining the nature and origins of the good, and in what sense one ought to pursue it.]]
Goal-dependent oughts run into problems even without an appeal to an innate human purpose. Consider cases where one has no desire to be good—whatever it is. If, for instance, a person wants to be good, and good means washing one's hands, then it seems one morally ought to wash their hands. The bigger problem in moral philosophy is what happens if someone does ''not'' want to be good, whatever its origins? Put simply, in what sense ''ought'' we to hold the goal of being good? It seems one can ask "how am I rationally required to hold 'good' as a value, or to pursue it?"&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Joyce |title=The Myth of Morality |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue above mentioned is a result of an important [[ethical relativist]] critique. Even if "oughts" depend on goals, the ought seems to vary with the person's goal. This is the conclusion of the [[ethical subjectivist]], who says a person can only be called good according to whether they fulfill their own, ''self-assigned'' goal. Alasdair MacIntyre himself suggests that a person's purpose comes from their culture, making him a sort of ethical relativist.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in {{cite book |authorlink=J. L. Mackie |first=J. L. |last=Mackie |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |year=1997 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical relativists acknowledge local, institutional facts about what is right, but these are facts that can still vary by society. Thus, without an objective "moral goal", a moral ought is difficult to establish. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] was particularly critical of the word "ought" for this reason; understood as "We need such and such, and the only way to get it is this way"—a person may need something immoral, or else find that their noble need requires immoral action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Anscombe |year=1958 |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |volume=33 |issue=124 |pages=1–19 |jstor=3749051 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100037943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If moral goals depend on private assumptions or public agreement, so may morality as a whole. For example, Canada might call it good to maximize global welfare, where a citizen, Alice, calls it good to focus on herself, and then her family, and finally her friends (with little empathy for strangers). It does not seem that Alice can be objectively or rationally bound—without regard to her personal values ''nor'' those of groups of other people—to act a certain way. In other words, we may not be able to say "You just ''should'' do this". Moreover, persuading her to help strangers would necessarily mean appealing to values she already possesses (or else we would never even have a hope of persuading her).&lt;ref&gt;http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is another interest of [[normative ethics]]—questions of [[Normative ethics#Binding force|binding forces]].

There may be responses to the above relativistic critiques. As mentioned above, ethical realists that are non-natural can appeal to God's purpose for humankind. On the other hand, naturalistic thinkers may posit that valuing people's well-being is somehow 'obviously' the purpose of ethics, or else the only relevant purpose worth talking about. This is the move made by [[natural law]], [[scientific moralist]]s and some [[utilitarians]].

===Institutional facts===
[[John Searle]] also attempts to derive "ought" from "is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Searle |first=John R. |title=How to Derive 'Ought' From 'Is' |journal=Philosophical Review |volume=73 |year=1964 |issue=1 |pages=43–58 |jstor=2183201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to show that the act of making a promise places one under an obligation by definition, and that such an obligation amounts to an "ought". This view is still widely debated, and to answer criticisms, Searle has further developed the concept of [[institutional fact]]s, for example, that a certain building ''is'' in fact a bank and that certain paper ''is'' in fact money, which would seem to depend upon general recognition of those institutions and their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Searle |first=John R. |year=1995 |title=The construction of social reality |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-02-928045-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indefinables===

Indefinables are concepts so global that they cannot be defined; rather, in a sense, they themselves, and the objects to which they refer, define our reality and our ideas.  Their meanings cannot be stated in a true definition, but their meanings can be referred to instead by being placed with their incomplete definitions in [[self-evident]] statements, the truth of which can be tested by whether or not it is impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus, the truth of indefinable concepts and propositions using them is entirely a matter of logic.

An example of the above is that of the concepts "finite parts" and "wholes"; they cannot be defined without reference to each other and thus with some amount of circularity, but we can make the self-evident statement that "the whole is greater than any of its parts", and thus establish a meaning particular to the two concepts.

These two notions being granted, it can be said that statements of "ought" are measured by their ''prescriptive'' truth, just as statements of "is" are measured by their ''descriptive'' truth; and the descriptive truth of an "is" judgment is defined by its correspondence to reality (actual or in the mind), while the prescriptive truth of an "ought" judgment is defined according to a more limited scope—its correspondence to right desire (conceivable in the mind and able to be found in the rational appetite, but not in the more "actual" reality of things independent of the mind or rational appetite).&lt;ref name="prescriptive truths"&gt;see Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, this may immediately suggest the question: "How can we know what is a right desire if it is already admitted that it is not based on the more actual reality of things independent of the mind?" The beginning of the answer is found when we consider that the concepts "good", "bad", "right" and "wrong" are indefinables. Thus, right desire cannot be defined properly, but a way to refer to its meaning ''may'' be found through a self-evident prescriptive truth.&lt;ref name="definables"&gt;As an example of philosophical argumentation that identifies particular indefinables, we take "being" and then "good".  Aristotle stated that although being is not a genus (''Posterior Analytics'' 2.7), yet of everything that is, being is predicated (''Topics'' 4.1), and that the [[Genus-differentia definition]]s, of which he was the first recorded proponent, requires that its subject be defined through its genus and a differentia.  But since nothing lies outside of what is predicated of being, there is nothing which can serve as a differentia.  So being is postulated to be indefinable.  Later, Aquinas made an [[argument]] that stated, "Good and being are the really the same, and differ only according to reason....  [G]ood presents the aspect of desirableness, which being does not present." (''Summa Theologica'', Part I, Q. 5, Art. 1) So good is postulated to be indefinable.&lt;/ref&gt;

That self-evident truth which the moral cognitivist claims to exist upon which all other prescriptive truths are ultimately based is: ''One ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else.'' The terms "real good" and "right desire" cannot be defined apart from each other, and thus their definitions would contain some degree of circularity, but the stated self-evident truth indicates a meaning particular to the ideas sought to be understood, and it is (the moral cognitivist might claim) impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus combined with other descriptive truths of what is good (goods in particular considered in terms of whether they suit a particular end and the limits to the possession of such particular goods being compatible with the general end of the possession of the total of all real goods throughout a whole life), a valid body of knowledge of right desire is generated.&lt;ref name="self-evident"&gt;See for example Ruggiero, ''Thinking Critically about Ethical Issues'', 5th ed., Ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an "ought" logically follows from an "is." First of all, [[Hilary Putnam]], by tracing back the quarrel to Hume's dictum, claims fact/value entanglement as an objection, since the distinction between them entails a value. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (2007), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; John Searle points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury." Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connection between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Misunderstanding ===
[[Hilary Putnam]] argues philosophers that accept Hume's "is–ought" distinction reject his reasons in making this, and thus undermine the entire claim.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary (2003). ''The Collapse of the Fact-Value Dichotomy and Other Essays'', Harvard University Press, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have also indicated that, in the very work where Hume argues for the is–ought problem, Hume himself derives an "ought" from an "is".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, Annette. "Hume's Own 'Ought' Conclusions," in Hume on Is and Ought&lt;/ref&gt;  Such seeming inconsistencies in Hume have led to an ongoing debate over whether Hume actually held to the is–ought problem in the first place, or whether he meant that ought inferences can be made but only with good argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgen, Charles. "Hume on Is and Ought"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements''' ('''KPU''') is an [[axiom system]] for [[set theory]] with [[urelement]]s, based on the traditional (urelement-free) [[Kripke–Platek set theory]]. It is considerably weaker than the (relatively) familiar system [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFU]]. The purpose of allowing urelements is to allow large or high-complexity objects (such as [[Baire space (set theory)|the set of all reals]]) to be included in the theory's transitive models without disrupting the usual well-ordering and recursion-theoretic properties of the [[constructible universe]]; KP is so weak that this is hard to do by [[constructible universe#relative constructibility|traditional means]].

==Preliminaries==

The usual way of stating the axioms presumes a two sorted first order language &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; with a single binary relation symbol  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;.
Letters of the sort &lt;math&gt;p,q,r,...&lt;/math&gt; designate urelements, of which there may be none, whereas letters of the sort &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,...&lt;/math&gt; designate sets. The letters &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,...&lt;/math&gt; may denote both sets and urelements.

The letters for sets may appear on both sides of &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, while those for urelements may only appear on the left, i.e. the following are examples of valid expressions: &lt;math&gt;p\in a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b\in a&lt;/math&gt;.

The statement of the axioms also requires reference to a certain collection of formulae called &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formulae. The collection &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt; consists of those formulae that can be built using the constants, &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, and bounded quantification. That is quantification of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \exists x \in a&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is given set.

==Axioms==

The axioms of KPU are the [[universal closure]]s of the following formulae:

* [[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \in a \leftrightarrow x\in b)\rightarrow a=b&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom of regularity|Foundation]]: This is an [[axiom schema]] where for every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\exists a. \phi(a) \rightarrow \exists a (\phi(a) \wedge \forall x\in a\,(\neg \phi(x)))&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Axiom of pairing|Pairing]]: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\, (x\in a \land y\in a )&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom of union|Union]]: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \forall c \in b. \forall y\in c (y \in a)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom schema of predicative separation|&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-Separation]]: This is again an [[axiom schema]], where for every &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; we have the following &lt;math&gt;\exists a \forall x \,(x\in a \leftrightarrow x\in b \wedge \phi(x) )&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-[[Axiom schema of replacement|Collection]]: This is also an [[axiom schema]], for every &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in a.\exists y. \phi(x,y)\rightarrow \exists b\forall x \in a.\exists y\in b. \phi(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;.
* Set Existence: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\, (a=a)&lt;/math&gt;

===Additional assumptions===
Technically these are axioms that describe the partition of objects into sets and urelements.

* &lt;math&gt;\forall p \forall a (p \neq a)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall p \forall x (x \notin p)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

KPU can be applied to the model theory of [[infinitary language]]s. [[model theory|Models]] of KPU considered as sets inside a maximal universe that are [[transitive set|transitive]] as such are called [[admissible set]]s.

The '''[[law]] of [[Europe]]''' is diverse and changing fast today. Europe saw the birth of both the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], which form the basis of the two dominant forms of legal system of private law, [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[common law]].

==History==
[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|right|150px|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]
The law of Europe has a diverse history. [[Roman law]] underwent major codification in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], as later developed through the [[Middle Ages]] by medieval legal scholars. In [[Medieval]] [[England]], judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of [[Europe]], but with the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 17th century [[Nordic countries]] and around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] and [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss codes]] were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[European Union]]'s Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the [[European Union Law|Treaties]]. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the [[European Court of Justice]]. In accordance with its history, the interpretation of European law relies less on policy considerations than U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360'']; Martin Gelter &amp; [[Kristoffel Grechenig]], [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2421224 ''History of Law and Economics''], forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law &amp; Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laziness''' (also known as '''indolence''') is disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to act or 
exert oneself. It is often used as a pejorative; terms for a person seen to be lazy
include [[Sedentary lifestyle|couch potato]], [[slacker]], and [[wikt:bludger|bludger]].

Despite [[Sigmund Freud]]'s discussion of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], [[Leonard Carmichael]] notes that "laziness is not a word that appears in the table of contents of most technical books on [[psychology]]... It is a guilty secret of modern psychology that more is understood about the [[motivation]] of thirsty [[rat]]s and hungry pecking [[pigeon]]s as they press levers than about the way in which [[poet]]s make themselves write poems or [[scientist]]s force themselves into the laboratory when the good [[golf]]ing days of spring arrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Laziness and the Scholarly Life|author=Leonard Carmichael|publisher=The Scientific Monthly|volume=78|number=4|date=Apr 1954|pages=208–213|jstor=21392}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1931 survey found that [[high school]] students were more likely to attribute their failing performance to laziness, while teachers ranked "lack of ability" as the major cause, with laziness coming in second.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=High-School Students' Opinions on Reasons for Failure in High-School Subjects|author=Harry Howard Gilbert|publisher=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=23|number=1|date=Jan 1931|pages=46–49|jstor=27525294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laziness is not to be confused with [[avolition]], a negative symptom of certain mental health issues such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], [[sleep disorders]], and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/schizophrenia/index.shtml|title=NIMH · Schizophrenia|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/adhd.10.1.6.20567?journalCode=adhd==Religious views==&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Laziness is a habit rather than a mental health issue. It may reflect a lack of self-esteem, a lack of positive recognition by others, a lack of discipline stemming from low self-confidence, or a lack of interest in the activity or belief in its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/200806/laziness-fact-or-fiction|title=Laziness: Fact or Fiction?|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laziness may manifest as procrastination or vacillation. Studies of [[motivation]] suggest that laziness may be caused by a decreased level of motivation, which in turn can be caused by over-stimulation or excessive impulses or distractions. These increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for reward and pleasure. The more dopamine that is released, the greater intolerance one has for valuing and accepting  productive and rewarding action.&lt;ref&gt;Wemesfelder, F.&lt;/ref&gt; This desensitization leads to dulling of the neural patterns and affects negatively the anterior insula of the brain responsible for risk perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/20026-brain-dopamine-worker-slacker.html|title=Brain Chemicals Predict Laziness - Risk, Reward &amp; Hard Work|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ADHD]] specialists say engaging in multiple activities can cause behavioral problems such as attention/focus failure or perfectionism and subsequently pessimism. In these circumstances laziness can manifest as a negative coping mechanism (aversion), the desire to avoid certain situations in the hopes of countering certain experiences and preconceived ill results.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, University of Calgary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lacanianism|Lacanian]] thought says laziness is the "acting out" of [[archetype]]s from societal programming and negative child rearing practices. Boredom is sometimes conflated with laziness; one study shows that the average Briton is bored 6 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;triviala.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Goetz, University of Konstanz, Germany, and John Eastwood, York University, Canada, concur that aversive states such as laziness can be equally adaptive for making [[Change management#Approach|change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilUaGnloq_8|title=Who Moved My Cheese [Original] - Spencer Johnson|first=|last=theotomji|date=23 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toxic if allowed to fester. An outlook found to be helpful in their studies is "being mindful and not looking for ways out of it, simultaneously to be also open to creative and active options if they should arise." They point out that a relentless engaging in activities without breaks can cause oscillations of failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg|title=Two Monkeys Were Paid Unequally: Excerpt from Frans de Waal's TED Talk|first=|last=TED Blog Video|date=4 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may result in mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Motivation and Emotion, Vol. 38&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been shown that laziness can render one apathetic to reactant mental health issues such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]], [[Schizoid personality disorder|indifference]], [[substance abuse]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

==Economics==
{{See also|Protestant work ethic|Achievement ideology}}

[[Economist]]s have differing views of laziness. [[Frédéric Bastiat]] argues that idleness is the result of people focusing on the pleasant immediate effects of their actions rather than potentially negative long-term consequences. Others note that humans seem to have a tendency to seek after leisure. Hal Cranmer writes, "For all these arguments against laziness, it is amazing we work so hard to achieve it. Even those hard-working Puritans were willing to break their backs every day in exchange for an eternity of lying around on a cloud and playing the harp. Every industry is trying to do its part to give its customers more leisure time."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/daily/928|author=Cranmer, Hal|title=In Defense of Laziness|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|date=April 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Mises]] writes, "The expenditure of labor is deemed painful. Not to work is considered a state of affairs more satisfactory than working. Leisure is, other things being equal, preferred to travail (work). People work only when they value the return of labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought about by the curtailment of leisure. To work involves [[disutility]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/humanaction/chap7sec3.asp|year=1949|chapter=Action Within the World|title=Human Action|author=von Mises, Ludwig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary==
Laziness in American literature is figured as a fundamental problem with social and spiritual consequences. In 1612 John Smith in his "Map to Virginia" is seen using a jeremiad to address idleness. In the 1750s this sort of advocating reached at its apex in literature's. David Bertelson in "The Lazy South" (1767) expressed this as a substitution of "spiritual industry" over "patriotic industry". Writers like William Byrd went to a great extent and censured North Carolina as land of lubbers. Thomas Jefferson in his "Notes on the State of Virginia" (1785) acknowledges a small portion of the people have only seen labor and identifies the cause of this indolence to the rise of "slave-holding" society. Jefferson raised his concerns what this deleterious system will bring to the economic system. Later by the 1800s the rise of Romanticism changed attitudes of the society, values of work were re-written; stigmatization of idleness was overthrown with glamorous notions. [[John P. Kennedy|John Pendleton Kennedy]] was a prominent writer in romanticizing sloth and slavery, In Swallow Barn (1832) he equated idleness and its flow as living in oneness with nature. Mark Twain in "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (1885) contrasts realist and romantic perspective of "laziness" and calls attention to the essential convention of aimlessness and transcendence that connects the character. In 20th century the poor whites were portrayed in the grotesque caricatures of early southern laziness. In Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood (1952) and Good Country People (1955) depicts spiritual backwardness as the cause for disinclination to work. Lacking in any social function which was termed equally with luxurious lifestyle was closely portrayed through lives of displaced aristocrats and their indolence. Jason Compson, Robert Penn Warren, William Styron were some of the writers who explored this perspective. The lack of meaningful work was defined as a void which aristocrats needed to fill with pompous culture, [[Walker Percy]] is a writer who have thoroughly mined on the subject. Percy's characters often exposes to the emptiness (spiritual sloth) of contemporary life and come to rectify it with renewed resources of spiritual resources.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Flora et. al.

One of the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[seven deadly sins]] is [[sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]], which is often defined as spiritual and/or physical [[apathy]] or laziness. Sloth is discouraged in ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:12}}), [[2 Thessalonians]], and associated with wickedness in one of the [[parables of Jesus]] in the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' ({{bibleverse||Matthew|25:26}}).  In the [[wisdom literature|Wisdom books]] of ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' and ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'', it is stated that laziness can lead to [[poverty]]  ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|10:4}}, {{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|10:18}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2015/01/31/top-7-bible-verses-about-laziness/|title=Top 7 Bible Verses About Laziness|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbible.info/topics/laziness|title=What Does the Bible Say About Laziness?|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Binsfeld]]'s ''Binsfeld's Classification of Demons'', [[Belphegor]] is thought to be its chief demon.&lt;ref name=belphegor/&gt;

The Arabic term used in the [[Quran]] for laziness, inactivity and sluggishness is كَسَل (''kasal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=ksl|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Quran Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of laziness is [[Jihad#Sunni|Jihad al-Nafs]], i.e. the struggle against the self, against one’s own ego. Among the [[five pillars of Islam]], [[salat|praying five times a day]] and [[sawm|fasting during Ramaḍān]] are part of actions against laziness.

===Buddhism===
{{main|Kausīdya}}
In Buddhism, the term ''[[kausīdya]]'' is commonly translated as "laziness" or "spiritual sloth". ''Kausīdya'' is defined as clinging to unwholesome activities such as lying down and stretching out, procrastinating, and not being enthusiastic about or engaging in virtuous activity.

== In selected societies==
From 1909 to 1915, the [[Rockefeller]] Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease sought to eradicate [[hookworm]] infestation from 11 [[southern U.S.]] states. Hookworms were popularly known as "the germ of laziness" because they produced listlessness and weakness in the people they infested. Hookworms infested 40 percent of southerners and were identified in the North as the cause of the South's alleged backwardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The War against Hookworm|author=Ronald L. Numbers|publisher=Science, New Series|volume=215|number=4530|date=Jan 15, 1982|pages=280–281|jstor=1688243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged{{By whom|date=March 2013}} that indolence was the reason for backward conditions in [[Indonesia]], such as the failure to implement [[Green Revolution]] agricultural methods. But a counter-argument is that the Indonesians, living very precariously, sought to play it safe by not risking a failed crop, given that not all experiments introduced by outsiders had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The "Ethic of Indolence": Another View|author1=Karen A. Laidlaw |author2=Ronald E. Seavoy |publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=10|number=1|date=March 1979|pages=190–193|jstor=20070277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
It is common for animals (even those like [[hummingbird]]s that have high energy needs) to forage for food until satiated, and then spend most of their time doing nothing, or at least nothing in particular. They seek to "[[satisfice]]" their needs rather than obtaining an optimal diet or habitat. Even [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals, which have a limited amount of daylight in which to accomplish their tasks, follow this pattern. Social activity comes in a distant third to eating and resting for foraging animals. When more time must be spent foraging, animals are more likely to sacrifice time spent on aggressive behavior than time spent resting. Extremely efficient [[predator]]s have more free time and thus often appear more lazy than relatively inept predators that have little free time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|jstor=4216378|title=Time Resources and Laziness in Animals|author=Joan M. Herbers|publisher=Oecologia|volume=49|number=2|year=1981|pages=252–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beetle]]s likewise seem to forage lazily due to a lack of foraging competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Laziness" and Hypothermia as a Foraging Strategy in Flower Scarabs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)|author1=Bernd Heinrich |author2=Elizabeth Mcclain |publisher=Physiological Zoology|volume=59|number=2|date=Mar–Apr 1986|pages=273–282|jstor=30156041}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some animals, such as [[pigeon]]s and [[rat]]s, seem to prefer to respond for food rather than eat equally available "free food" in some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pitfalls of Organismic Concepts: "Learned Laziness"?|author1=Elkan R.

[[Magical thinking]] in various forms is a [[cultural universal]] and an important aspect of [[religion]].
Magic is prevalent in all societies, regardless of whether they have organized religion or more general systems of [[animism]] or [[shamanism]].
Religion and magic became conceptually separated with the development of western [[monotheism]], where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by mainstream religious doctrine ([[miracle]]s) and magic rooted in folk belief or occult speculation.
In pre-monotheistic religious traditions, there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides.

== Magical practices in prehistory ==

=== Anthropological and psychological perspectives ===
{{Main|Magical thinking|Evolutionary origin of religion}}

It is a postulate of modern [[anthropology]], at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.122-3. Quotation: {{quotation|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1932) [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True ''Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119025854/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True |date=2011-11-19 }}, in [[Gifford Lectures]]. Lecture II [https://archive.is/20120731050138/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;ArticleID=3  ''Hope'']. Quotation: {{quotation|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of The Golden Bough, would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional differences between religion and magic==
Early sociological interpretations of magic by [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Henri Hubert]] emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops.&lt;ref name='Pasi'&gt;Pasi, M. 2006. "Magic". in von Stuckrad, K. (ed.) ''The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Religion. Volume III. M-R.'' Leiden and Boston, Brill. 1134-1140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).&lt;ref name='Pasi' /&gt;

[[Ralph Merrifield]], the [[British people|British]] archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a [[Material culture|material]] approach to magic,&lt;ref name='Materiality'&gt;Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. 'Introduction: The materiality of the materiality of magic', in Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. (eds.) ''The Materiality of Magic: An artefactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs''.Oxford and Philadelphia, Oxbow Books. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the differences between religion and magic: 
"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse".&lt;ref name='Merrifield'&gt;Merrifield, R. 1987. ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London, Guild Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, “instrumental coercive manipulation”, opposed to the religious attitude of “personal and supplicative negotiation”; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.&lt;ref name='Versnel'&gt;Versnel, H. S. 1991. “Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion.” Numen 38 (2). 177-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

This separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing "belief in spiritual beings" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, B-C. 2013. "Towards Historicizing 'Magic' in Antiquity", ''Numen'' 60. 308-347.&lt;/ref&gt; However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.&lt;ref name='Versnel' /&gt;

==Religious practices and magic==
Both magic and religion contain [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref name='Merrifield' /&gt; 
Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a [[shamanistic]] interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ Magic and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235043/http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names of the gods ===
There is a long-standing belief in the power of [[true name]]s, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants  power over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title=The Necessity of Art: A Marxist Approach

If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all.  This belief is reflected in traditional [[Wicca]], where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the [[Tetragrammaton]] (YHWH, usually translated as "&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;" in small caps) to refer to God in the [[Tanakh]]. The same belief is seen in [[Hinduism]], but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a ''good'' thing.  Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="CHU"&gt;{{cite book

==Magic and Abrahamic religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Magician (paranormal)]] --&gt;
{{main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible|Christian views on magic}}
Magic and [[Abrahamic religions]] have had a somewhat checkered past.  The [[King James Version]] of the Bible included the famous translation "''Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live''" (Exodus 22:18),&lt;ref name="KJV"&gt;{{cite book
 | title = [[King James Version of the Bible]]
 | year = 1611 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul]] is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's  sorcerers as well as [[The Staff of Moses|the staff of Moses]] and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed "their secret arts" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2019%20-%20JANES%201996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the King James Version, this reads: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The precise meaning of the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]] it was translated as ''pharmakeia'', meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, [[Reginald Scot]] claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Scot|Scot, Reginald]] (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mahoroba''''' is an ancient [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word describing a far-off land full of bliss and [[peace]]. It is roughly comparable to the western concepts of [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadia]], a place surrounded by mountains full of harmony and quiet.

''Mahoroba'' is now written only in [[hiragana]] as まほろば. The origins of the word are not clear; it is described in a poem in the ancient ''[[Kojiki]]'' (古事記) as being the perfect place in [[Japan|Yamato]]:

In [[physics]], '''Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime''' govern the dynamics of the [[electromagnetic field]] in [[curvature|curved]] [[spacetime]] (where the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] may not be the [[Minkowski metric]]) or where one uses an arbitrary (not necessarily [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]) coordinate system. These equations can be viewed as a generalization of the [[Maxwell's equations#In vacuum|vacuum Maxwell's equations]] which are normally formulated in the [[local coordinates]] of [[flat spacetime]]. But because [[general relativity]] dictates that the presence of electromagnetic fields (or [[energy]]/[[matter]] in general) induce curvature in spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h224886u7651v774/ | doi=10.1007/BF00762342 | bibcode=1984GReGr..16..495H | volume=16 | title=The significance of curvature in general relativity | year=1984 | journal=General Relativity and Gravitation | pages=495–500 | last1 = Hall | first1 = G. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime should be viewed as a convenient approximation.

When working in the presence of bulk matter, it is preferable to distinguish between free and bound electric charges. Without that distinction, the vacuum Maxwell's equations are called the "microscopic" Maxwell's equations. When the distinction is made, they are called the macroscopic Maxwell's equations.

The electromagnetic field also admits a coordinate-independent geometric description, and Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of these geometric objects are the same in any spacetime, curved or not.  Also, the same modifications are made to the equations of flat [[Minkowski space]] when using local coordinates that are not Cartesian. For example, the equations in this article can be used to write Maxwell's equations in [[spherical coordinates]]. For these reasons, it may be useful to think of Maxwell's equations in Minkowski space as a [[special case]], rather than Maxwell's equations in curved spacetimes as a generalization.

==Summary==

In [[general relativity]], the [[metric (general relativity)|metric]], ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, is no longer a constant (like η&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; as in [[metric tensor (general relativity)#Examples|Examples of metric tensor]]) but can vary in space and time, and the equations of electromagnetism in a vacuum become:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} \, = \, \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} \, - \, \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu\alpha} \, F_{\alpha\beta} \, g^{\beta\nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu} \, = \, \partial_\nu \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_\mu \, = \, F_{\mu\nu} \, J^\nu \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the [[Lorentz force]], ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt; is the reciprocal of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''g'' is the [[determinant]] of the metric tensor. Notice that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; are (ordinary) tensors while &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, ''J''&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are [[tensor density|tensor ''densities'']] of weight +1. Despite the use of [[partial derivative]]s, these equations are invariant under arbitrary curvilinear coordinate transformations. Thus if one replaced the partial derivatives with [[covariant derivative]]s, the extra terms thereby introduced would cancel out.  (Cf. [[manifest covariance#Example]].)

==The electromagnetic potential==

The [[Electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic potential]] is a covariant vector, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; which is the undefined primitive of electromagnetism. As a covariant vector, its rule for transforming from one coordinate system to another is
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{A}_{\beta}(\bar{x}) = \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma}(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Electromagnetic field==
The [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field]] is a covariant [[antisymmetric tensor]] of degree 2 which can be defined in terms of the electromagnetic potential by

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} = \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

To see that this equation is invariant, we transform the coordinates (as described in the [[classical treatment of tensors]])

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\bar{F}_{\alpha \beta} &amp;= \frac{\partial \bar{A}_{\beta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} - \frac{\partial \bar{A}_{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma} \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} A_{\delta} \right) \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial^2 x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma} + \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} - \frac{\partial^2 x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} A_{\delta} - \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\delta}} - \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial x^{\gamma}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\delta}} - \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial x^{\gamma}} \right) \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} F_{\delta \gamma}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition implies that the electromagnetic field satisfies 

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which incorporates [[Faraday's law of induction]] and [[Gauss's law for magnetism]]. This is seen by

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} = \partial_\lambda \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\lambda \partial_\nu A_\mu + \partial_\mu \partial_\nu A_\lambda - \partial_\mu \partial_\lambda A_\nu + \partial_\nu \partial_\lambda A_\mu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu A_\lambda = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Although there appear to be 64 equations in Faraday–Gauss, it actually reduces to just four independent equations. Using the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic field one can either reduce to an identity (0 = 0) or render redundant all the equations except for those with ''λ'', ''μ'', ''ν'' being either 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3, 0 or 3, 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2.

The Faraday–Gauss equation is sometimes written

:&lt;math&gt;F_{[\mu \nu; \lambda]} = F_{[\mu \nu, \lambda]} = \frac{1}{6} \left( \partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} - \partial_\lambda F_{\nu \mu} - \partial _\mu F_{\lambda \nu} - \partial_\nu F_{\mu \lambda} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} \right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where a semicolon indicates a covariant derivative, a comma indicates a partial derivative, and square brackets indicate anti-symmetrization (see [[Ricci calculus]] for the notation). The covariant derivative of the electromagnetic field is

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta; \gamma} = F_{\alpha \beta, \gamma} - {\Gamma^{\mu}}_{\alpha \gamma} F_{\mu \beta} - {\Gamma^{\mu}}_{\beta \gamma} F_{\alpha \mu},&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Christoffel symbol]], which is symmetric in its lower indices.

==Electromagnetic displacement==
The [[electric displacement field]], '''D''' and the [[auxiliary magnetic field]], '''H''' form an antisymmetric contravariant rank 2 [[tensor density]] of weight +1. In a vacuum, this is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu \alpha} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, g^{\beta \nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is the only place where the metric (and thus gravity) enters into the theory of electromagnetism. Furthermore, the equation is invariant under a change of scale, that is, multiplying the metric by a constant has no effect on this equation. Consequently, gravity can only affect electromagnetism by changing the [[speed of light]] relative to the global coordinate system being used. Light is only deflected by gravity because it is slower when near to massive bodies. So it is as if gravity increased the index of refraction of space near massive bodies.

More generally, in materials where the [[magnetization]]&amp;ndash;[[electric polarization|polarization]] tensor is non-zero, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu \alpha} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, g^{\beta \nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, - \, \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation law for electromagnetic displacement is
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathcal{D}}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \, \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \, \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Jacobian determinant]] is used. If the magnetization-polarization tensor is used, it has the same transformation law as the electromagnetic displacement.

==Electric current==
The electric current is the divergence of the electromagnetic displacement. In a vacuum,

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu} = \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

If magnetization-polarization is used, then this just gives the free portion of the current

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu}_{\text{free}} = \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

This incorporates [[Ampere's Law]] and [[Gauss's Law]].

In either case, the fact that the electromagnetic displacement is antisymmetric implies that the electric current is automatically conserved

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} J^{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

because the partial derivatives [[Commutative property|commute]].

The Ampere-Gauss definition of the electric current is not sufficient to determine its value because the electromagnetic potential (from which it was ultimately derived) has not been given a value. Instead, the usual procedure is to equate the electric current to some expression in terms of other fields, mainly the electron and proton, and then solve for the electromagnetic displacement, electromagnetic field, and electromagnetic potential.

The electric current is a contravariant vector density, and as such it transforms as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{J}^{\mu} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Verification of this transformation law

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\bar{J}^{\mu} &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \left( \bar{\mathcal{D}}^{\mu \nu} \right) \\[6pt]

 &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \right) \\[6pt]

 &amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \frac{\partial \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}\\[6pt]

&amp; = 0+ \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \left( \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}} {\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So all that remains is to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which is a version of a known theorem (see [[Inverse functions and differentiation#Higher derivatives]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} &amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} 
\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial x^{\sigma}} + \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \mathbf{4} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz force density==
The density of the [[Lorentz force]] is a covariant vector density given by

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mu} = F_{\mu \nu} J^{\nu} .&lt;/math&gt;

The force on a test particle subject only to gravity and electromagnetism is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d p_{\alpha}}{dt} = \Gamma^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} p_{\beta} \frac{d x^{\gamma}}{dt} + q F_{\alpha \gamma} \frac{d x^{\gamma}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the linear 4-momentum of the particle, ''t'' is any time coordinate parameterizing the world line of the particle, Γ&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;αγ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] (gravitational force field), and ''q'' is the electric charge of the particle.

This equation is invariant under a change in the time coordinate; just multiply by &lt;math&gt;d t/d \bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; and use the [[chain rule]]. It is also invariant under a change in the ''x'' coordinate system.

Using the transformation law for the Christoffel symbol

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\epsilon}} \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\zeta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \Gamma^{\epsilon}_{\delta \zeta} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d \bar{p}_{\alpha}}{dt} - \bar{\Gamma}^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} \bar{p}_{\beta} &amp; \frac{d\bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} - q \bar{F}_{\alpha \gamma} \frac{d \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} = \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} p_{\delta} \right) - \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\theta}}  \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\iota}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \Gamma^{\theta}_{\delta \iota} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \right) \frac{\partial x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\zeta}} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} - q \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} F_{\delta \zeta} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \left( \frac{d p_{\delta}}{dt} - \Gamma^{\epsilon}_{\delta \zeta} p_{\epsilon} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} - q F_{\delta \zeta} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \right) + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \right) p_{\delta} - \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} 
\frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \right) \frac{\partial x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\zeta}} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \\[6pt]

&amp; = 0 + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \right) p_{\delta} - \frac{\partial^2 x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{d \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} = 0

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Lagrangian==
In a vacuum, the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] for classical electrodynamics (in joules/meter&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is a scalar [[tensor density|density]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, F^{\alpha \beta} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, + \, A_{\alpha} \, J^{\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha \beta} = g^{\alpha \gamma} F_{\gamma \delta} g^{\delta \beta} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The four-current should be understood as an abbreviation of many terms expressing the electric currents of other charged fields in terms of their variables.

If we separate free currents from bound currents, the Lagrangian becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, F^{\alpha \beta} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, + \,A_{\alpha} \, J^{\alpha}_{\text{free}} \, + \, \frac12 \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, \mathcal{M}^{\alpha \beta} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor==
{{main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}

As part of the source term in the [[Einstein field equations]], the electromagnetic [[stress–energy tensor]] is a covariant symmetric tensor

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \nu} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu \nu} F_{\sigma \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \rho} g^{\rho \sigma} \right  ) &lt;/math&gt;

using a metric of signature (−,+,+,+). If using the metric with signature (+,−,−,−), the expression for &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; will have opposite sign. The stress–energy tensor is trace-free

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu} g^{\mu \nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

because electromagnetism propagates at the [[invariant speed]].

In the expression for the conservation of energy and linear momentum, the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor is best represented as a mixed tensor density

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu} = T_{\mu \gamma} g^{\gamma \nu} \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the equations above, one can show that

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{; \nu} + f_{\mu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the semicolon indicates a [[covariant derivative]].

This can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;- {\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{, \nu} = - \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu \nu} \mathfrak{T}_{\sigma}^{\nu} + f_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

which says that the decrease in the electromagnetic energy is the same as the work done by the electromagnetic field on the gravitational field plus the work done on matter (via the Lorentz force), and similarly the rate of decrease in the electromagnetic linear momentum is the electromagnetic force exerted on the gravitational field plus the Lorentz force exerted on matter.

Derivation of conservation law

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{; \nu} + f_{\mu} &amp;= -\frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma} g^{\gamma \nu} + F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma ; \nu} g^{\gamma \nu} - \frac12 \delta_{\mu}^{\nu} F_{\sigma \alpha ; \nu} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \rho} g^{\rho \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} + \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma ; \nu} g^{\gamma \nu} \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\alpha \nu} - \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left  ( \left (- F_{\nu \mu ; \alpha} - F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} \right ) F^{\alpha \nu} - \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \nu ; \alpha} F^{\alpha \nu} - F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} F^{\alpha \nu} + \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\sigma \alpha} \right  ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\nu \alpha} - \frac12 F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} F^{\alpha \nu} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left (- F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\alpha \nu} + \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is zero because it is the negative of itself (see four lines above).

==Electromagnetic wave equation==
The [[nonhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation]] in terms of the field tensor is modified from the [[Formulation of Maxwell's equations in special relativity|special relativity form]] to

:&lt;math&gt; \Box F_{ab} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  F_{ab;}{}^d{}_d = \, -2 R_{acbd} F^{cd} + R_{ae}F^e{}_b - R_{be}F^e{}_a + J_{a;b} - J_{b;a} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;acbd&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the covariant form of the [[Riemann tensor]] and &lt;math&gt; \Box &lt;/math&gt; is a generalization of the [[d'Alembertian]] operator for covariant derivatives. Using

:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a} = {{A^{a; }}^{b}}_{ b} &lt;/math&gt;

Maxwell's source equations can be written in terms of the [[Four-potential|4-potential]] [ref 2, p.&amp;nbsp;569] as,

:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a}  - {A^{b;a}}_{ b} = - \mu_0 J^{ a } &lt;/math&gt;

or, assuming the generalization of the [[Lorenz gauge]] in curved spacetime

:&lt;math&gt;  {A^{ a  }}_{ ; a } = 0 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a}  = - \mu_0 J^{ a }  + {R^{ a }}_{ b } A^{ b } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  R_{ a b }  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {R^{ s }}_{ a s b } &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci curvature tensor]].

This the same form of the wave equation as in flat spacetime, except that the derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives and there is an additional term proportional to the curvature. The wave equation in this form also bears some resemblance to the Lorentz force in curved spacetime where ''A&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' plays the role of the 4-position.

== Nonlinearity of Maxwell's equations in a dynamic spacetime ==

When Maxwell's equations are treated in a [[background independent]] manner, that is, when the spacetime metric is taken to be a dynamical variable dependent on the electromagnetic field, then the electromagnetic wave equation and Maxwell's equations are nonlinear. This can be seen by noting that the curvature tensor depends on the stress–energy tensor through the [[Einstein field equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;   G_{ab} =  \frac{8 \pi G} {c^4}   T_{ab}    &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;  {G}_{a  b} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\        {R}_{a b} - {1 \over 2} {R} g_{a b}   &lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Einstein tensor]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], ''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[metric tensor]], and ''R'' ([[scalar curvature]]) is the trace of the Ricci curvature tensor. The stress–energy tensor is composed of the stress-energy from particles, but also stress-energy from the electromagnetic field. This generates the nonlinearity.

== Geometric formulation ==

In the differential geometric formulation of the electromagnetic field, the antisymmetric Faraday tensor can be considered as the [[differential form#Applications in physics|Faraday 2-form]] '''F'''.  In this view, one of Maxwell's two equations is  d'''F'''= '''0''', where ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]] operator. This equation is completely coordinate and metric independent and says that the electro-magnetic flux through a closed two dimensional surface in space time is topological, more precisely, depends only on its  [[homology class]] (a generalization of the integral form of Gauss law and Maxwell-Faraday equation as the homology class in Minkowski space is automatically 0). By the [[Poincaré lemma]], this equation implies, (at least locally) that there exists a 1-form '''A''' satisfying '''F''' = d '''A'''. The other Maxwell equation is d * '''F''' = '''J'''.
In this context, '''J''' is the [[differential form#Applications in physics|current 3-form]] (or even more precise, twisted three form), the asterisk * denotes the [[Hodge star]] operator, and d is the exterior derivative operator. The dependence of Maxwell's equation on the metric of spacetime lies in the Hodge star operator * on two forms, which is [[conformally invariant]].  Written this way, Maxwell's equation is the same in any space time, manifestly coordinate invariant, and convenient to use (even in Minkowski space or Euclidean space and time especially with curvilinear coordinates).

An even more geometric interpretation is that the Faraday two form '''F''' is (up to a factor i) the [[curvature 2-form]] &lt;math&gt;F(\nabla)&lt;/math&gt; of a ''U''(1)-[[Connection (vector bundle)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; on a [[principal bundle|principal ''U''(1)-bundle]] whose sections represent charged fields. The connection is much like the vector potential since every connection can be written as &lt;math&gt;\nabla = \nabla_0 + iA&lt;/math&gt; for a "base" connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla_0&lt;/math&gt; and '''F''' = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + d '''A'''. In this view, the Maxwell "equation", d '''F'''= '''0''', is a mathematical identity known as the [[Bianchi identity]]. The equation  d * '''F''' = '''J''' is the only equation with any physical content in this formulation. This point of view is particularly natural when considering charged fields or quantum mechanics. It can be interpreted as saying that, much like gravity can be understood as being the result of the necessity of a connection to parallel transport vectors at different points, electromagnetic phenomena, or more subtle quantum effects like the [[Aharanov-Bohm effect]], can be understood as a result from the necessity of a connection to parallel transport charged fields or wave sections at different points. In fact, just as the Riemann tensor is the [[holonomy]] of the Levi Civita connection along an infinitesimal closed curve, the curvature of the connection is the holonomy of the U(1)-connection.

{{Utilitarianism |expanded=Problems}}

The '''mere addition paradox''', also known as the '''repugnant conclusion''', is a problem in [[ethics]], identified by [[Derek Parfit]] and discussed in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.

==The paradox==

Consider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the [[happiness]] of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.

[[Image:MereAddition.svg|center]]

How do these populations compare in value? 

Parfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).

Next, Parfit suggests that ii) B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.

Then, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that B− is better than A+, (c) that B− is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.

==Criticisms and responses==
Some scholars, such as [[Larry Temkin]] and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the "better than" relation is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that B− is better than A+ it simply does not follow that B− is better than A.

[[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbjorn|first=Tannsjo|date=January 2009|title=Why We Ought to Accept the Repugnant Conclusion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/why-we-ought-to-accept-the-repugnant-conclusion/F60DB3A1B9CA4460650EA5DF9AA0540D|journal=Utilitas|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0953820800003642|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Huemer]] also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| title=In Defence of Repugnance| first=Michael| last=Huemer| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109034025/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| archivedate=2016-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|isbn=019824908X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term ''mere addition paradox'' was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-120/ |title=Another Mere Addition Paradox? Some Reflections on Variable Population Poverty Measurement |publisher=UNU-WIDER |date=November 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |isbn=978-92-9230-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a ''no mere addition axiom'' to be used for judging such statistical measures: "merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

This same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game. Thus, if 10,000 people download the demo of a game and 2,000 buy it, the game is a borderline success; however, it would be rendered a failure by an extra 500 people downloading the demo and not buying, even though this "mere addition" changes nothing with regard to income or consumer satisfaction from the previous situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">'''Microwave International New Media Arts Festival''' (微波國際新媒體藝術節）is a [[new media]] art festival based in [[Hong Kong]]. It began in 1996 as the annual [[video art]] festival for local video art collective [[Videotage]].

In 2006, it became independent from Videotage and in 2007 it officially became fully independent as the government's previous "presenter" role was handed over to Microwave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microwavefest.net/ Microwavefest.net].&lt;/ref&gt; The government remains the main sponsor of the Festival, although many more sponsors are sought for each year's Festival. 

The annual festival generally includes a main exhibition at the Hong Kong City Hall, a smaller scale and usually more alternative exhibition in a separate venue, a keynote conference, performances, screening programmes and other special events organised each year. 

In 2007, the performance by US art collective [[Graffiti Research Lab]] that "hacked the city" with their [[L.A.S.E.R.T.A.G]] along with the participation of local graffiti artist [[MC Yan]], they achieved a record-breaking tag&lt;ref&gt;[http://graffitiresearchlab.com/projects/hong_kong/ GRL + MC YAN = H$NG K$NG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117194515/http://graffitiresearchlab.com/projects/hong_kong/ |date=2010-11-17 }}, [http://graffitiresearchlab.com/ Graffiti Research Lab].&lt;/ref&gt; 1,200 metres ''across'' [[Victoria Harbour]] ([[James Powderly]] and MC Yan tagging from Central ferry, with [[Evan Roth]] and the local crew controlling the set up in front of the [[Hong Kong Cultural Centre|Cultural Centre]] in Tsim Sha Tsui).

In its first extended event outside of the annual November Festival, Microwave also held the "A-Glow-Glow" Macro Interactive Media Art Exhibition in April 2008, which was funded by the [[Hong Kong Arts Development Council]] and aimed for more mass appeal. Two large-scale interactive [[LED]] artworks were placed by the [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] waterfront, right across the harbour from the [[Hong Kong City Hall]], where the annual festival main exhibition is held.

Microwave's festival design, by local design partner [[Milkxhake]], also consistently wins design awards almost every year since their partnership commenced.

'''Molecular drive''' is a term coined by [[Gabriel Dover]] in 1982 to describe [[evolution]]ary processes that change the genetic composition of a [[population]] through DNA turnover mechanisms.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/299111a0| title = Molecular drive: A cohesive mode of species evolution| journal = Nature| volume = 299| issue = 5879| pages = 111| year = 1982| last1 = Dover | first1 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trends&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90211-8| title = Molecular drive in multigene families: How biological novelties arise, spread and are assimilated| journal = Trends in Genetics| volume = 2| pages = 159| year = 1986| last1 = Dover | first1 = G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular drive operates independently of [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]].

The best-known such process is the [[concerted evolution]] of [[gene]]s present in many tandem copies, such as those for [[ribosomal RNA]]s or [[Bombyx mori|silk moth]] egg shell [[chorion]] proteins, in [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species. The concept has been proposed to extend to the diversification of [[Protein family|multigene families]].&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; The mechanisms involved include [[gene conversion]], [[unequal crossing-over]], [[Transposon|transposition]], [[slipped strand mispairing|slippage replication]] and RNA-mediated exchanges. Because [[mutation]]s changing the sequence of one copy are less common than [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Gene duplication|duplications]] and replacement of one copy by another, the copies gradually come to resemble each other much more than they would if they had been evolving independently.

Concerted evolution can be unbiased, in which case every version has an equal probability of being the one that replaces the others.  However, if the molecular events have any bias favouring one version of the sequence over others, that version will dominate the process and eventually replace the others.  The name 'molecular drive' reflects the similarity of the process with what was originally the better-known process of [[meiotic drive]].

Molecular drive can also act in [[bacteria]], where parasexual processes such as natural [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] cause DNA turnover.

== TRAM ==
According to [[Gabriel Dover|Dover]], '''TRAM''' is a genetic system that has features of [[Non-mendelian inheritance]] '''T'''urnover, copy number and functional '''R'''edundancy '''A'''nd '''M'''odulatory. To date all regulatory regions ([[promotor (biology)|promoter]]s) and [[gene]]s, that have been examined in detail at the molecular level, have TRAM characteristics. As such, part of their evolutionary history will have been influenced by the molecular drive process.

== Adoptation ==
According to [[Gabriel Dover|Dover]], '''Adoptation''' is an evolved feature of an organism that contributes to its viability and reproduction (established by molecular drive) and that adopts some previously inaccessible component of the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22823">In [[physics]], '''  motion''' is a change in [[Position (vector)|position]] of an object over time. Motion is [[mathematically]]  described in terms of [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[distance]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[time]], and [[speed]]. Motion of a body is observed by attaching a [[frame of reference]] to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame.

If the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference (reference point), the body is said to be ''at rest'', ''motionless'', ''immobile'', ''[[wikt:stationary|stationary]]'', or to have constant ([[time-invariant]]) position. An object's motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a [[force]], as described. Momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring the motion of an object. An object's [[momentum]] is directly related to the object's [[mass]] and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time, as described by the [[law of conservation of momentum]].

As there is no absolute frame of reference, ''[[Absolute space and time|absolute motion]]'' cannot be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wahlin|first=Lars|chapter=9.1 Relative and absolute motion |title=The Deadbeat Universe|year=1997|publisher=Coultron Research|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=0-933407-03-3|pages=121–129|url=http://www.colutron.com/download_files/chapt9.pdf |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be moving.&lt;ref name=Tyson&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyson|first=Neil de Grasse|author2=Charles Tsun-Chu Liu |author3=Robert Irion  |title=The universe : at home in the cosmos|year=2000|publisher=[[National Academy Press]]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-06488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

Motion applies to objects, bodies, and matter particles, to radiation, radiation fields and radiation particles, and to space, its curvature and space-time. One can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries. So, the term motion, in general, signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system. For example, one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle, where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions.

==Laws of motion==
{{Main|Mechanics}}

In physics, motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory [[scientific law|laws]] of mechanics. Motions of all large-scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as [[projectile]]s, [[planet]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, and [[human]]s) are described by [[classical mechanics]]. Whereas the motion of very small [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|sub-atomic]] objects is described by [[quantum mechanic]]s.
{| class="wikitable"
|'''First law''':
|In an [[inertial reference frame]], an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant [[velocity]], unless acted upon by a [[net force]].
|-
|'''Second law''':
|In an inertial reference frame, the vector [[Vector sum|sum]] of the [[forces]] '''F''' on an object is equal to the [[mass]] ''m'' of that object multiplied by the [[acceleration]] '''a''' of the object: '''F''' = ''m'''''a'''.
|-
|'''Third law''':
|When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
|}

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
Classical mechanics is used for describing the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[projectiles]] to parts of [[machinery]], as well as [[astronomical objects]], such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. It produces very accurate results within these domains, and is one of the oldest and largest in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]].

Classical mechanics is fundamentally based on [[Newton's laws of motion]]. These laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body. They were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] in his work ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', first published on July 5, 1687. Newton's three laws are:
# A [[Physical body|body]] either is at rest or moves with constant velocity, until and unless an outer force is applied to it.
# An object will travel in one direction only until an outer force changes its direction.
# Whenever one body exerts a force '''F''' onto a second body, (in some cases, which is standing still) the second body exerts the force −'''F''' on the first body. '''F''' and −'''F''' are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense. So, the body which exerts '''F''' will go backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's "Axioms or Laws of Motion" can be found in the "[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's three laws of motion were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding [[orbit]]ing bodies in [[outer space]]. This explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth.

Classical mechanics was further enhanced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. Special relativity is concerned with the motion of objects with a high [[velocity]], approaching the [[speed of light]]; general relativity is employed to handle [[gravitation]]al motion at a deeper level.

'''Uniform Motion:'''
{{Missing information|section|the information in the last sentence of this section '''does not provide sufficient and complete information'''|date=October 2017}}

When an object moves with a constant speed at a particular direction at regular intervals of time it's known as the ''uniform motion.'' For example: a bike moving in a straight line with a constant speed.

EQUATIONS OF UNIFORM MOTION:

If v = final velocity, u = initial velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, s = displacement, then :
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{a}\mathbf{t}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v}^2 = \mathbf{u}^2 + 2\mathbf{a}\mathbf{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}\mathbf{t} + \frac{\mathbf{a}\mathbf{t}^2}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[Quantum mechanics]] is a set of principles describing [[Physical systems|physical reality]] at the atomic level of matter ([[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s) and the [[subatomic particle]]s ([[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and even smaller [[elementary particle]]s such as [[quark]]s). These descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both [[matter]] and [[radiation]] energy as described in the [[wave–particle duality]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In classical mechanics, accurate [[measurement]]s and [[prediction]]s of the state of objects can be calculated, such as [[Absolute location|location]] and [[velocity]]. In the quantum mechanics, due to the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], the complete state of a subatomic particle, such as its location and velocity, cannot be simultaneously determined. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena, quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large-scale phenomenon such as [[superfluidity]], [[superconductivity]], and [[biological system]]s, including the function of [[Olfactory receptor|smell receptors]] and the [[protein structure|structures of proteins]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==List of "imperceptible" human motions==
Humans, like all known things in the universe, are in constant motion;&lt;ref name=Tyson/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} however, aside from obvious movements of the various external [[anatomy|body]] parts and [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to [[Motion perception|perceive]].  Many of these "imperceptible motions" are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation. The larger scales of imperceptible motions are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons: [[Newton's laws of motion]] (particularly the third) which prevents the feeling of motion on a mass to which the observer is connected, and the lack of an obvious [[frame of reference]] which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Safkan|first=Yasar|title=Question: If the term 'absolute motion' has no meaning, then why do we say that the earth moves around the sun and not vice versa?|url=http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae118.cfm|work=Ask the Experts|publisher=PhysLink.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller scales of these motions are too small to be detected conventionally with human [[sense]]s.

===Universe===
[[Spacetime]] (the fabric of the universe) is [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]] meaning everything in the [[universe]] is stretching like a [[rubber band]]. This motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such, but rather a change in the very nature of the universe. The primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by [[Edwin Hubble]] who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from Earth, known as [[Hubble's law]], predicted by a universal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, Edwin, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30954 A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae]" (1929) ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168–173 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168 Full article], PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galaxy===
The [[Milky Way Galaxy]] is moving through [[space]] and many astronomers believe the velocity of this motion to be approximately {{convert|600|km/s|mph|sigfig=3}} relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies.

The human [[heart]] is constantly contracting to move [[blood]] throughout the body. Through larger veins and arteries in the body, blood has been found to travel at approximately 0.33&amp;nbsp;m/s.

===Particles===
According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], all [[Subatomic particle|particles]] of [[matter]] are in constant random motion as long as the [[temperature]] is above [[absolute zero]]. Thus the [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s which make up the human body are vibrating, colliding, and moving. This motion can be detected as temperature; higher temperatures, which represent greater [[kinetic energy]] in the particles, feel warm to humans who sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves. Similarly, when lower temperature objects are touched, the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html Temperature and BEC.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110174808/http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html |date=2007-11-10 }} Physics 2000: Colorado State University Physics Department&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subatomic particles===
Within each atom, [[electron]]s exist in an area around the nucleus.  This area is called the [[electron cloud]].  According to [[Bohr model|Bohr's model]] of the atom, electrons have a high [[Electron velocity|velocity]], and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move.  If electrons 'move' about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun, then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light.  However, there is no reason that one must confine one's self to this strict conceptualization, that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do.  Rather one can conceptualize electrons to be 'particles' that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/newton/askasci/1993/physics/PHY112.HTM|title=Classroom Resources - Argonne National Laboratory|work=anl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the [[atomic nucleus]], the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s are also probably moving around due to the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of [[angular momentum]] of both particles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/teachersguide/pdf/Chap02.pdf Chapter 2, Nuclear Science- A guide to the nuclear science wall chart.

==Light==
{{main|Speed of light}}
Light propagates at 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, often approximated as {{convert|299792|km/s|mi/s}} in a vacuum. The speed of light (or ''c'') is also the speed of all [[massless particle]]s and associated [[field (physics)|field]]s in a vacuum, and it is the upper limit on the speed at which energy, matter, [[physical information|information]] or [[Causality (physics)|causation]] can travel; the speed of light is the limit of speed for all physical systems.

In addition, the speed of light is an invariant quantity: it has the same value, irrespective of the position or speed of the observer. This property makes the speed of light ''c'' a natural measurement unit for speed.

[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]
[[Revolutionary France]] enacted laws that first [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated Jews]] in France, establishing them as equal citizens to other Frenchmen. In countries that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ensuing [[First French Empire]] conquered during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], he emancipated the Jews and introduced other ideas of freedom from the French Revolution. For instance, he overrode old laws restricting Jews to reside in [[ghettos]], as well as lifting laws that limited Jews' rights to property, worship, and certain occupations.

In an effort to promote Jewish integration into French society, however, Napoleon also implemented several policies that eroded Jewish distinction. For example, he restricted the Jewish practice of money-lending, restricted the regions to which Jews were allowed to migrate, and required Jews to adopt formal names. He also implemented a series of consistories -- which served as an effective channel utilized by the French government to regulate Jewish religious life. 

Historians have disagreed about Napoleon's intentions in these actions, as well as his personal and political feelings about the Jewish community. Some have said he had political reasons but did not have sympathy for the Jews. His actions were generally opposed by the leaders of monarchies in other countries. After his defeat by Great Britain, a counter-revolution swept many of these countries and they restored discriminatory measures against the Jews.

==Napoleon's Law and the Jews==

The [[French Revolution]] abolished the different treatment of people according to religion or origin that had existed under the monarchy. Roman Catholicism had been the established state religion, closely tied historically to the monarchy, which represented both religious and political authority. The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] and free exercise of worship, provided that it did not contradict public order. At that time, most other European countries implemented measures that restricted the rights of people in their nations who practiced minority religions.

In the early 19th century, through his conquests in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte spread the modernist ideas of revolutionary France: equality of citizens and the rule of law. Napoleon's personal attitude towards the Jews has been interpreted in various ways by different historians, as at various times he made statements both in support and opposition to the Jewish people.  Orthodox Rabbi [[Berel Wein]] in ''Triumph of Survival: The Story of the Jews in the Modern Era 1650-1990'' (1990) claims that Napoleon was interested primarily in seeing the Jews assimilate, rather than prosper as a distinct community: "Napoleon's outward tolerance and fairness toward Jews was actually based upon his grand plan to have them disappear entirely by means of total assimilation, intermarriage, and conversion."{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Napoleon was concerned about the role of Jews as money lenders, wanting to end that. The treatment of the Alsace Jews and their debtors was raised in the Imperial Council on 30 April 1806.&lt;!--What were the questions and resolution?  --&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His liberation of the Jewish communities in Italy (notably in [[Ancona]] in the [[Papal States]]) and his insistence on the integration of Jews as equals in French and Italian societies demonstrate that he distinguished between usurers (whether Jewish or not), whom he compared to [[locusts]], and Jews who accepted non-Jews as their equals.

His letter to Champagny, Minister of the Interior of 29 November 1806, expresses his thoughts:
:[It is necessary to] reduce, if not destroy, the tendency of Jewish people to practice a very great number of activities that are harmful to civilisation and to public order in society in all the countries of the world. It is necessary to stop the harm by preventing it; to prevent it, it is necessary to change the Jews. [...] Once part of their youth will take its place in our armies, they will cease to have Jewish interests and sentiments; their interests and sentiments will be French.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

(While insisting on the primacy of civil law over the military, Napoleon retained a deep respect and affection for the military as a profession. He often hired former soldiers in civilian occupations).

Through his policies overall, Napoleon greatly improved the condition of the Jews in France and Europe, and they widely admired him. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures enhancing the position of the [[Jew]]s in the French Empire. He recognized a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the ''[[Sanhedrin#Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"|Sanhedrin]],'' as their representatives to the French government.

In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to living in [[ghetto]]s. In 1807, he designated [[Judaism]] as one of the official religions of France, along with [[Roman Catholicism]] (long the established state religion), and [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. (Followers of the latter had been severely persecuted by the monarchy in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.)

In 1808 Napoleon rolled back a number of reforms (under the so-called ''décret infâme'', or Infamous Decree, of 17 March 1808), declaring all debts with Jews to be annulled, reduced or postponed. The Infamous Decree imposed a ten-year ban on any kind of Jewish money-lending activity. Similarly, Jewish individuals who were in subservient positions -- such as a Jewish servant, military officer, or wife -- were unable to engage in any kind of money-lending activity without the explicit consent of their superiors. Napoleon's goal in implementing the Infamous Decree of 1808 was to integrate Jewish culture and customs into those of France. By restricting money-lending activity, Jews would be forced to engage in other practices for a living. Likewise, in order to even engage in money-lending activity, the decree required Jews to apply for an annual license, granted only with the recommendation of the Jews' local consistory and with the surety of the Jews' honesty&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This caused so much financial loss that the Jewish community nearly collapsed. On a different note, the Infamous Decree also placed heavy restrictions on the Jews' ability to migrate. The decree prevented the Jews from relocating to the regions of Alsace and required that Jews wishing to move to other regions of France own or purchase land to farm. It also required them to refrain from engaging in any kind of money-lending activity. (The law eventually only placed these restrictions on the Jews of the northeast.) Likewise, the French decree required Jewish individuals to serve in the French military, without any opportunity to provide a replacement individual&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The last component of the Infamous Decree – established in July 1808 – required Jews to adopt formal names with which they would be addressed. (Before, Jews were often referred to as “Joseph son of Benjamin.”) They were also prevented from selecting names of cities or names in the Hebrew Bible. Napoleon sought to integrate the Jewish people more fully into French society by establishing the guidelines they were required to follow in adopting names&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Napoleon ended these restrictions by 1811.

Historian [[Ben Weider]] argued that Napoleon had to be extremely careful in defending oppressed minorities such as Jews, because of keeping balance with other political interests, but says that the leader clearly saw political benefit to his Empire in the long term in supporting them. Napoleon hoped to use equality as a way of gaining advantage from discriminated groups, like Jews or Protestants.

Both aspects of his thinking can be seen in an 1822 response to physician Barry O'Meara, who had written to Napoleon after he had been exiled, asking why he pressed for the emancipation of the Jews:

:I wanted to make them leave off [[usury]], and become like other men...by putting them upon an equality, with Catholics, Protestants, and others, I hoped to make them become good citizens, and conduct themselves like others of the community...as their rabbins explained to them, that they ought not to practise usury to their own tribes, but were allowed to do so with Christians and others, that, therefore, as I had restored them to all their privileges...they were not permitted to practise usury with me or them, but to treat us as if we were of the tribe of Judah. Besides, I should have drawn great wealth to France as the Jews are very numerous, and would have flocked to a country where they enjoyed such superior privities. Moreover, I wanted to establish an universal liberty of conscience.&lt;ref name="o'meara"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/napoleoninexile01omegoog#page/n212/mode/2up|title= Napoleon in Exile |author= Barry Edward O'Meara |year= 1822 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter to his brother [[Jérome Napoleon]], dated 6 March 1808, Napoleon expressed a conflicting view:

:I have undertaken to reform the Jews, but I have not endeavoured to draw more of them into my realm. Far from that, I have avoided doing anything which could show any esteem for the most despicable of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/newlettersnapol02napogoog#page/n99/mode/2up |title= New letters of Napoleon I |year= 1898 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonaparte's  proclamation to the Jews of Africa and Asia===

During Napoleon's [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] in 1799, ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]],'' the main French newspaper during the French Revolution, published on 3 [[Prairial]], [[French Republican Calendar/Y7|Year vii]] ([[French Republican Calendar]], equivalent to 22 May 1799) a short statement that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Buonaparte a fait publier une proclamation, dans laquelle il invite les juifs de l'Asie et de l'Afrique à venir se ranger sous ses drapeaux, pour rétablir l'ancienne Jérusalem; il en a déjà armé un grand nombre, et leurs bataillons menacent Alep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u8OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22dans+laquelle+il+invite+les+juifs+de%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1vcETunzEcy38gP-1dytDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dans%20laquelle%20il%20invite%20les%20juifs%20de%22&amp;f=false|title=Buonaparte peint par lui-même dans sa carrière militaire et politique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been translated in English as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] has published a proclamation in which he invites all the Jews of Asia and Africa to gather under his flag in order to re-establish the ancient [[Jerusalem]]. He has already given arms to a great number, and their battalions threaten [[Aleppo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.napoleonicsociety.com/french/pdf/NapoleonJuifs.pdf|title= Napoléon et les Juifs (in French) |author= Ben Weider|year= 1997 |quote= Bonaparte, Commandant en chef des Armées de la République Française en Afrique et en Asie, aux héritiers légitimes de la Palestin|pages= |publisher=Napoleonic Society| work=Congrès de la Société Internationale Napoléonienne, Alexandrie, Italie; 21-26 Juin 1997| accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Napoleon's forces lost to [[Great Britain]] and he never carried out his alleged plan. Historians such as Nathan Schur in ''Napoleon and the Holy Land'' (2006) believe that Napoleon intended the proclamation for propaganda and to build support for his campaign among the Jews in those regions. Ronald Schechter believes that the newspaper was reporting a rumor, as there is no documentation that Napoleon contemplated such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ronald Schechter  | title = Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815 | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2003 | page = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians &lt;!-- who? --&gt; suggest that the proclamation was intended to gain support from [[Haim Farhi]], the Jewish advisor to [[Jezzar Pasha|Ahmed al Jazzar]], the Muslim ruler of [[Acre (city)|Acre]], and to bring him over to Napoleon's side. Farhi commanded the defence of Acre on the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1940, historian Franz Kobler claimed to have found a detailed version of the proclamation from a German translation.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kobler, "Napoleon and the restoration of the Jews to Palestine", ''The New Judaea,'' September 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Kobler's claim was published in ''The New Judaea,'' the official periodical of the [[Zionist Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=5f0ETqOkKcSY8QOIj6zIDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=I_NWAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+new+judaea%22&amp;q=%22the+new+judaea%22#search_anchor|title=The Menorah Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kobler version suggests that Napoleon was inviting Jews across the Mideast and North Africa to create a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0197100236|title=Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin|author=Simon Schwarzfuchs

These concepts have been more commonly associated with the [[Zionist]] movement, which developed in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"/&gt;

Historians such as Henry Laurens, Ronald Schechter, and Jeremy Popkin believe that the German document (which has never been found) was a forgery, as asserted by Simon Schwarzfuchs in his 1979 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Simon Schwarzfuchs | title = Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin | publisher = Routledge | year = 1979 | pages = 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Laurens (scholar)|Laurens, Henry]], ''Orientales I, Autour de l'expédition d'Égypte'', pp.123–143, CNRS Éd (2004), {{ISBN|2-271-06193-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9udsEHFtikkC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22franz+kobler%22+napoleon+1799&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ev0ETuSsBIiw8gP20LC0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22franz%20kobler%22%20napoleon%201799&amp;f=false Ronald Schechter, ''Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815''], 2003.

Rabbi Aharon Ben-Levi of Jerusalem also added his voice to the proclamation, calling on the Jews to enlist in Napoleon's army "to return to Zion as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah" and rebuild the Temple. According to Prof. [[Mordechai Gichon]], a military historian and archaeologist from Tel Aviv University, who summarized 40 years of research on the subject, Napoleon had an idea to establish a national home for the Jews in the Land of Israel, "Napoleon believed the Jews would repay his favors by serving French interests in the region."Gichon claimed. "After returning to France, all he was interested in when it came to the Jews was how to use them to reinforce the French nation," Gichon says. "Therefore, he tried to conceal the Zionist chapter of his past." On the other hand, Prof. Ze'ev Sternhell of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, however, believes the entire story is nothing more than an oddity. "Napoleon's big contribution came, in fact, in form of promoting the incorporation of the Jews into French society," &lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.4827319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Napoleon's legacy==
Napoleon had more influence on the Jews in Europe than detailed in his decrees. By breaking up the feudal castes of mid-Europe and introducing the equality of the [[French Revolution]], he achieved more for Jewish emancipation than had been accomplished during the three preceding centuries. As part of recognizing the Jewish community, he established a national [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite Consistory]] in France. It was intended to serve as a centralizing authority for Jewish religious and community life. Napoleon implemented several other regional consistories throughout the French Empire, as well, with the Israelite Consistory serving as the lead consistory; it had the responsibility of overseeing the various regional consistories. The regional consistories, in turn, oversaw the economic and religious aspects of Jewish life. The regional consistories consisted of a five-individual board, usually occupied by one (or, in some cases two) rabbis, and the rest lay individuals who lived in the districts over which the consistory maintained jurisdiction. The Israelite Consistory in France consisted of three rabbis and two lay individuals. In charge of the Israelite Consistory (and the consistory system in general) was a 25-member board. The members of the board, all Jews, were appointed by the prefect, thus allowing the French government to regulate the system of consistories and, in turn, various aspects of Jewish life&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly he established the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}}). This served as a model for other German states until after the fall of Napoleon. Napoleon permanently improved the condition of the Jews in the Prussian [[Rhine provinces]] by his rule of this area.

[[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne|Börne]] both recorded their sense of obligation to Napoleon's principles of action.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The German Jews in particular have historically regarded Napoleon as the major forerunner of Jewish emancipation in Germany. When the government required Jews to select surnames according to the mainstream model, some are said to have taken the name of ''Schöntheil,'' a translation of "Bonaparte."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the Jewish ghettos, legends grew up about Napoleon's actions. Twentieth-century Italian author [[Primo Levi]] wrote that Italian Jews often chose ''Napoleone'' and ''Bonaparte'' as their [[given name]] to recognize their historic liberator.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Reactions of major European powers===

The Russian [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander I]] objected to Napoleon's emancipation of the Jews and establishment of the Great Sanhedrin. He vehemently denounced the liberties given Jews and demanded that the Russian Orthodox Church protest against Napoleon's tolerant religious policy. He referred to the Emperor in a proclamation as "the Anti-Christ" and the "Enemy of God".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Holy Synod of Moscow proclaimed: "In order to destroy the foundations of the Churches of Christendom, the Emperor of the French has invited into his capital all the Judaic synagogues and he furthermore intends to found a new Hebrew [[Sanhedrin]] ― the same council that the Christian bible states, condemned to death (by crucifixion) the revered figure, Jesus of Nazareth."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Czar persuaded Napoleon to sign a 17 March 1808 decree restricting the freedoms accorded to the Jews. Napoleon expected in exchange that the Czar would help persuade Great Britain to end the war in Europe. Absent that, three months later, Napoleon effectively cancelled the decree by allowing local authorities to implement his earlier reforms. More than half of the French départements restored citizens' guaranteed freedoms to the Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Austria, [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Chancellor Metternich]] wrote, "I fear that the Jews will believe (Napoleon) to be their promised Messiah".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Prussia, leaders of the Lutheran Church were extremely hostile to Napoleon's actions. Italian kingdoms were suspicious of his actions, although expressing less violent opposition. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Great Britain, which was at war with Napoleon, rejected the principle and doctrine of the Sanhedrin.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Jews in Europe===

All the states under French authority applied Napoleon's reforms. In Italy, the Netherlands, and the German states, the Jews were emancipated and able to act as free men for the first time in those nations. After the British defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], a counter-revolution in many of these countries resulted in the restoration of discriminatory measures against Jews.

[[File:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Naïve realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

In [[philosophy of mind]], '''naïve realism''', also known as '''direct realism''', '''common sense realism''' or '''perceptual realism''', is the idea that the [[senses]] provide us with direct [[awareness]] of [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s as they ''really'' are. Objects obey the laws of [[physics]] and retain all their properties whether or not there is anyone to observe them.&lt;ref name="tok"&gt;[http://www.theoryofknowledge.info/naiverealism.html Naïve Realism], ''Theory of Knowledge.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of [[matter]], occupy [[space]] and have properties, such as size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually [[Perception|perceived]] correctly.

In contrast, some forms of [[idealism]] claim that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas, and some forms of [[skepticism]] say we cannot trust our senses. Naïve realism is known as [[Direct and indirect realism|''direct'' as against ''indirect'' or ''representational'']] realism when its arguments are developed to counter the latter position,  also known as [[epistemological dualism]];&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world.

==History==
For a history of direct realist theories, see ''[[Direct and indirect realism#History|Direct and indirect realism § History]]''.

==Overview==

The naïve realist theory may be characterized as the acceptance of the following five [[belief]]s:

* There exists a world of [[Materialism|material]] objects
* Some statements about these objects can be known to be true through [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]]
* These objects exist not only when they are being perceived but also when they are not perceived. The objects of perception are largely [[Objectivity (philosophy)|perception-independent]].
* These objects are also able to retain properties of the types we perceive them as having, even when they are not being perceived. Their properties are perception-independent.
* By means of our senses, we perceive the world directly, and pretty much as it is. In the main, our claims to have [[Epistemology|knowledge]] of it are justified."&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[visual perception]] in [[psychology]], the leading direct realist theorist was [[J. J. Gibson]]. Other psychologists were heavily influenced by this approach, including William Mace, Claire Michaels,&lt;ref&gt;http://ione.psy.uconn.edu:16080/~corr/Pages/MichaelsProfile.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Reed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Cognitive/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195073010&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Shaw, and Michael Turvey. More recently, [[Carol Fowler]] has promoted a direct realist approach to [[speech perception]].

Among [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosopher]]s who defended direct realism one might refer to, for example, [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle, for instance, addresses the popular but perhaps mistaken assumption that ''we can only directly perceive our own subjective experiences, but never objects and states of affairs in the world themselves''. According to Searle, it has influenced many thinkers to reject direct realism. But Searle contends that the rejection of direct realism is based on a bad argument: the [[Argument from illusion]], which in turn relies on vague assumptions on the nature or existence of "[[sense data]]". Various sense data theories were deconstructed in 1962 by the British philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] in a book titled ''Sense and Sensibilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''Sense and Sensibilia'', Oxford: Clarendon. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of sense data has been replaced by talk of representational perception in a broader sense, and scientific realists typically assume representational perception. But the assumption is philosophical, and arguably little prevents scientific realists from assuming direct perception, as in direct or "naïve" realism. In a blog-post on ''"Naive realism and color realism"'' Putnam&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam's blog 'Sardonic comment' at http://putnamphil.blogspot.se/2015/05/naive-realism-and-color-realism-in-1976.html. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; sums up with the following words:  &lt;br /&gt;
''"... Being an apple is not a natural kind in physics, but it is in biology, recall. Being complex and of no interest to fundamental physics isn't a failure to be "real".  I think green is as real as applehood.".''

[[Simon Blackburn]] has argued that whatever positions they may take in books, articles or lectures, naive realism is the view of "philosophers when they are off-duty."&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Second edition, revised), Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naïve and scientific realism or direct and indirect realism==
It is not uncommon to think of naïve realism as distinct from [[scientific realism]], which states that the [[universe]] contains just those properties that feature in a [[scientific]] description of it, not properties like colour ''per se'' but merely objects that reflect certain wavelengths owing to their microscopic surface texture. This lack of [[supervenience]] of experience on the physical world has influenced many thinkers to reject naïve realism as a physical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Claire &amp; Carello, Claudia. (1981). ''[http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/~psy254/MC.pdf Direct Perception]''. Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

One should add, however, that naïve realism does not claim that reality is only what we see, hear, etc. Likewise, scientific realism does not claim that reality is only what can be described by fundamental physics. It follows that the relevant distinction to make is not between naïve and scientific realism but between ''[[direct and indirect realism]]''.

The direct realist claims that the experience of a sunset, for instance, is the real sunset that we directly experience. The indirect realist claims that our relation to reality is indirect, so the experience of a sunset is a subjective copy of what really is radiation as described by physics. But the direct realist does not deny that the sunset is radiation; the experience has a hierarchical structure,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, 'Seeing Things as They Are; A Theory of Perception', Oxford University Press. 2015. p.111-114&lt;/ref&gt; and the radiation is part of what amounts to the direct experience.

An example of a scientific realist is [[John Locke]], who held the world only contains the [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary qualities]] that feature in a corpuscularian scientific account of the world (see [[corpuscular theory]]), and that other properties were entirely [[Subjectivity|subjective]], depending for their [[existence]] upon some perceiver who can observe the objects."&lt;ref name=tok/&gt;

The modern philosopher of science Howard Sankey argues for a form of scientific realism which has commonsense realism as one of its foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Realism and quantum physics===

{{Main|Principle of locality}}

Realism in physics refers to the fact that physical systems must have definite properties when measured or observed. [[Physics]] until the 19th century was implicitly and sometimes explicitly based on philosophical realism.

Scientific realism in classical physics has remained compatible with the naïve realism of everyday thinking on the whole, but there is no consistent way to visualize the world underlying quantum theory in terms of ideas of the everyday world. "The general conclusion is that in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] naïve realism, although necessary at the level of observations, fails at the microscopic level."&lt;ref&gt;Gomatam, Ravi. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1536 Physics and Commonsense - Reassessing the connection in the light of the quantum theory], ''arXiv.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] and quantum phenomena such as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] lead quantum physicists to conclude that "[w]e have no satisfactory reason for ascribing objective existence to physical quantities as distinguished from the numbers obtained when we make the measurements which we correlate with them. There is no real reason for supposing that a particle has at every moment a definite, but unknown, position which may be revealed by a measurement of the right kind .... On the contrary, we get into a maze of contradiction as soon as we inject into quantum mechanics such concepts as carried over from the language and philosophy of our ancestors .... It would be more exact if we spoke of 'making measurements' of this, that, or the other type instead of saying that we measure this, that, or the other 'physical quantity'."&lt;ref&gt;Kemble E. C. in Peres Asher, (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yLkUyCsb7cC Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods], Springer 1993 p. 17 {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2549-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to adhere to both the [[principle of locality]] (that distant objects cannot affect local objects), and counterfactual definiteness, a form of ontological realism implicit in classical physics. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics hold that a system lacks an actualized property until it is measured, which implies that quantum systems exhibit a non-local behavior. [[Bell's theorem]] proved that every [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] must either violate [[Principle of locality|locality]] or [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This claim has given rise to a contentious debate of the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. Although locality and 'realism,' in the sense of counterfactual definiteness, are jointly false, it is possible to retain one of them. The majority of working physicists discard counterfactual definiteness in favor of locality, since non-locality is held to be contrary to relativity. The implications of this stance are rarely discussed outside of the microscopic domain but the [[thought experiment]] of [[Schrödinger's cat]] illustrates the difficulties presented. As quantum mechanics is applied to larger and larger objects, even a one-ton bar, proposed to detect gravity waves, must be analysed quantum mechanically, while in [[cosmology]] a wave function for the whole universe is written to study the [[Big Bang]]. It is difficult to accept the quantum world as somehow not physically real, so "Quantum mechanics forces us to abandon naïve realism",&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, Bruce &amp; Kuttner, Fred. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hKrvv35-gcMC Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness], Oxford University Press US. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517559-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be argued that the counterfactual definiteness 'realism' of physics is a much more specific notion than general [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"We examine the prevalent use of the phrase “local realism” in the context of Bell’s Theorem and associated experiments, with a focus on the
question: what exactly is the ‘realism’ in ‘local realism’ supposed to
mean?". [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607057 Norsen, T.''Against 'Realism' '']&lt;/ref&gt;

"'[W]e have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today.' ([[Anton Zeilinger]]) .... By realism, he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties — that a ball is red, that a book contains the works of Shakespeare, or that an electron has a particular spin ... for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, like photons and electrons, it may make no sense to think of them as having well-defined characteristics. Instead, what we see may depend on how we look."&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip. (2007). [http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070416/full/070416-9.html Physicists bid farewell to reality?

==Virtual reality and realism==
"Virtual realism"&lt;ref&gt;Heim, Michael. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nyKP2-KlXAC Virtual Realism], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513874-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the above theories.

In the research paper ''The reality of virtual reality'' it is proposed that, "virtuality is itself a bona fide mode of reality, and that 'virtual reality' must be understood as 'things, agents and events that exist in cyberspace'. These proposals resolve the incoherences found in the ordinary uses of these terms... '[[virtual reality]]', though based on recent information technology, does not refer to mere technological equipment or purely mental entities, or to some fake environment as opposed to the real world, but that it is an [[Ontology|ontological]] mode of existence which leads to an expansion of our ordinary world."&lt;ref&gt;(Requires login) Yoh, Myeung-Sook. (2001). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7657/20918/00969726.pdf?arnumber=969726 The reality of virtual reality], Virtual Systems and Multimedia. pp. 666-674.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The emergence of teleoperation and virtual environments has greatly increased interest in "synthetic experience", a mode of experience made possible by both these newer technologies and earlier ones, such as telecommunication and sensory prosthetics... understanding synthetic experience must begin by recognizing the fallacy of naïve realism and with the recognition that the phenomenology of synthetic experience is continuous with that of ordinary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Jack. (1993). [http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~loomis/Loomis%20presence%20IEEE%2093.pdf Understanding Synthetic Experience Must Begin with the Analysis of Ordinary Perceptual Experience], ''IEEE 1993 Symposium on Research Frontiers in Virtual Reality'', 54-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged necessity to recognize a "fallacy of naïve realism" seems, however, unwarranted. One should not be misled by the word "naïve", for a naïve realist normally understands what a picture is: that the depicted face on a photograph, for instance, is not the real face, and that the things seen on a computer-screen are symbols or electronic depictions, and so on. A majority of the population arguably subscribes to naïve common sense notions of reality, without a recognizable loss in capacity to interact in cyberspace.

'''Negative utilitarianism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[utilitarianism]] that gives greater priority to reducing [[suffering]] (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing [[pleasure|happiness]] (positive utility).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Leslie|1998|page=12}}: "'Negative utilitarianism' is concerned mainly or entirely with reducing evils rather than with maximizing goods." The example unpleasant experiences is an example based on a hedonistic theory of well-being, according to which pleasant experiences are good for individuals and unpleasant experiences are bad for individuals. But there are other theories of well-being and negative utilitarianism need not adopt a hedonistic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|loc=chpt. 4}} The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the ''only'' thing that ultimately matters morally.{{sfn|Smart|1958}} Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are ''only'' concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that ''both'' positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} says that strong versions of negative utilitarianism "give all weight to disutility" and weak versions "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.” {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the well-being in an outcome depends on [[antifrustrationism|frustrated preferences]]. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.

The term "negative utilitarianism" was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. Ninian Smart]] in 1958 in his reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism:{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering.  {{sfn|Smart|1958|p=542}} Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.

== History ==
The term ‘negative utilitarianism’ was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] in his 1958 reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|p=542}}: "Professor Popper has proposed a negative formulation of the utilitarian principle, so that we should replace ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’ by ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’. He says: ‘It adds to the clarity of ethics if we formulate our demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of suffering rather than the promotion of happiness’. However, one may reply to negative utilitarianism..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Popper wrote, "I suggest, for this reason, to replace the utilitarian formula ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’. {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415610216|page=548}} Popper claimed that "there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula "Maximize pleasure" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all..." {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contestabile|2014|page=298}}: "Negative utilitarianism and Buddhism share the following intuitions: Negative utilitarianism—understood as an umbrella term—models the asymmetry between suffering and happiness and therefore accords with the Buddhist intuition of universal compassion. The Noble Truths of Buddhism accord with the negative utilitarian intuition that (global) suffering cannot be compensated by happiness. Some forms of Buddhism and negative utilitarianism share the intuition that non-existence is a perfect state." {{harvnb|Goodman|2009|page=101}}: “Negative utilitarianism shares with Buddhism a strong focus on alleviating the suffering of beings.”&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keown|1992|page=175}}: “one of the earliest exponents of NU, Hegesias...”&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist [[Edmund Gurney]] who wrote:

{{quote|Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability . . . of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer . . . in the negative. . . . When we forget pain, or underestimate it, or talk about people 'getting used to it', we are really so far losing sight of what the universe, which we wish to conceive adequately, really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.com/gurney/index.html|title=Edmund Gurney (1847 - 88)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Versions of negative utilitarianism ==
Like other kinds of [[utilitarianism]], negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the ''actual'' or ''expected'' consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the ''average'' outcome among individuals or the ''total'' net utility (or lack of disutility) among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinnott-Armstrong|2014}} provides a nice overview of the many ways in which consequentialism can be varied. Since utilitarianism (and negative utilitarianism) is a kind of consequentialism, much of it applies to utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as well. Section 1. "Classic Utilitarianism" shows the many distinct and variable claims that make up Classic Utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative utilitarianism can aim either to ''optimize'' the value of the outcome or it can be a ''satisficing'' negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be ''sufficiently'' valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=102}}, states satisficing utilitarianism as follows: "''Satisficing utilitarianism'' An action ought to be done if and only if it would bring about a sufficient level of total well-being."&lt;/ref&gt; A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.

=== The weight of evil (disutility) ===
Philosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility.&lt;ref&gt;They write that they distinguish among kinds of 'negative utilitarianism': "Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family. The problem was then to find out which members of this family we want to join, and to spell out why we do not want to be as some of our siblings." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}. The taxonomy is phrased in terms of 'negativisms,' which appear to be the same as 'negativist' and 'negative' utilitarianisms: "we believe that disutility has greater weight than utility. The overall aim with this part of our essay is to give an account of this weight, which means that we shall try to formulate a welfarist act-consequentialism that takes seriously the weight of disutility. In other words, we are looking for an acceptable negativist utilitarianism." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pp=30,38}} They first distinguish between ''strong negativism'' and ''weak negativism''. Strong negativism "give all weight to disutility" and weak negativism "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=39}}: "The claim that disutility has greater weight can now be expressed by letting the disutilities have greater lexical weight. But still the utility has some weight in the sense that if the disutilities are the same in the alternatives, and hence we cannot minimise the disutility any further, then we ought to maximise the utility. Depending on what kinds of disutilities we choose in establishing this order, we get different lexical negativisms."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "''Lexical Threshold NU''
Suffering and happiness both count, but there is some amount of suffering that no amount of happiness can outweigh."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not "agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Tomasik formulated and advocated consent-based negative utilitarianism. He writes, "would the person-moment suffering agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future? If yes, then the suffering doesn't pass the threshold of unbearableness and thus can be outweighed by happiness." {{harvnb|Tomasik|2015}}. See section “Consent-based negative utilitarianism?” The ‘person-moment’ means the person in the moment of suffering, as opposed to before or after the suffering occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other distinctions among versions of negative utilitarianism ===
[[Thomas Metzinger]] proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metzinger|2003|page=622}}: “In terms of a fundamental solidarity of all suffering beings against suffering, something that almost all of us should be able to agree on is what I will term the “principle of negative utilitarianism”: Whatever else our exact ethical commitments and specific positive goals are, we can and should certainly all agree that, in principle, and whenever possible, the overall amount of conscious suffering in all beings capable of conscious suffering should be minimized. I know that it is impossible to give any truly conclusive argument in favor of this principle. And, of course, there exist all kinds of theoretical complications—for example, individual rights, long-term preferences, and epistemic indeterminacy. But the underlying intuition is something that can be shared by almost everybody: We can all agree that no additional suffering should be created without need. Albert Camus once spoke about the solidarity of all finite beings against death, and in just the same sense there should be a solidarity of all sentient beings capable of suffering against suffering. Out of this solidarity we should not do anything that would increase the overall amount of suffering and confusion in the universe—let alone something that highly ''likely'' will have this effect right from the beginning.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Bunge]] writes about negative utilitarianism in his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "By recommending passivity it [negative utilitarianism] condones evil. The spectator who watches impassively a hooligan attacking an old woman, and the citizen who does not bother to vote, comply with negative utilitarianism and thereby tolerate evil."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The benevolent world-exploder ==
In the 1958 article where [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, "a benevolent world-exploder," would have a duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|page=542}}: "Suppose that a ruler controls a weapon capable of instantly and painlessly destroying the human race. Now it is empirically certain that there would be some suffering before all those alive on any proposed destruction day were to die in the natural course of events. Consequently the use of the weapon is bound to diminish suffering, and would be the ruler's duty on NU grounds." For his use of the term ‘the benevolent world-exploder’ see page 543.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism,{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the argument is directed against strong versions of negative utilitarainaism that prescribe only reducing negative well-being, as well as weak versions that are sufficiently close to strong negative utilitarianism. Such weak versions would be those that, although they give weight to both negative and positive well-being, give sufficiently much more the weight to negative well-being, so that they would have the same implications as strong versions in relevant situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have endorsed this argument,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "Negative utilitarianism ... is open to the following objections.... Fourthly, the most expeditious way of implementing the doctrine would be to exterminate humankind, for then human suffering would cease altogether (R. N. Smart 1958)." {{harvnb|Heyd|1992|p=60}}: "Negative utilitarianism, which seems promising in guiding us in genethics, also urges (at least in its impersonal version) paradoxical (and to some, morally abhorrent) solutions to the miseries of humanity. Primarily it recommends the painless annihilation of all humanity—either by the collective suicide of all actual beings, or by total abstention from procreation by one generation (Smart 1958, 542-543)." {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "R. N. Smart wrote a response [3] in which he christened the principle 'Negative Utilitarianism' and showed a major unattractive consequence. A thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means) as the suffering involved would be small compared to the suffering in everyday life in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.

=== Cooperation between different value systems ===
One possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains from Trade through Compromise – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html|title = Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminating vs. reducing disutility ===
Another reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating.&lt;ref&gt;This is essentially [[H. B. Acton]]'s reply. {{harvnb|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=84}}: "Eliminating suffering is not the same thing as reducing it or as arriving at 'the least amount of avoidable suffering for all', and it is the latter, not the former, that might, with some plausibility, be regarded as a possible substitute for the more usual form of utilitarianism. Would not, then, the destroyer imagined by Smart be making a terrible mistake through failing to notice the difference between eliminating and reducing?"&lt;/ref&gt; A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[J. J. C. Smart]]'s reply to Acton. J. J. C. Smart agrees with his brother R. N. Smart that "if we made the minimization of misery our sole ultimate ethical principle ... we should approve of a tyrannical but benevolent world exploder." {{harvnb|Smart|1973|page=29}} J. J. C. Smart replies to Acton that "surely eliminating is a case of reducing – the best case of all, the negative utilitarian would say. In suggesting that eliminating is not reducing, Acton seems to me to be like a person who says that zero is not a number." {{harvnb|Smart|1989||p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempting world destruction would be counterproductive ===
Several philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], who says that "planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution."{{sfn|Pearce|2005}} Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that "life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed."{{sfn|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}} A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that "anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful."&lt;ref&gt;Clark Wolf proposes and defends ‘negative critical level utilitarianism’ in the context of social choice and population choices, which says that "population choices should be guided by an aim to minimize suffering and deprivation" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=273}}. He brings up the possible objection to his principle that "it might occur to someone that the best way to minimize current suffering and deprivation would be to quietly, secretly, and painlessly kill off all of those who are miserable and needy" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}. A part of his reply is that "die hard utilitarians could argue that we rarely face such a policy choice, and that anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question "3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?" begins with "No, that would very bad even by NU standards."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}

=== Life could evolve again in a worse way ===
Some replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by [[John W. N. Watkins]] is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. N. Watkins]] describes himself as "a sort of negative utilitarian" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=95}}. He replies to R. N. Smart that "even if all life ''were'' destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again—this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very ''possibility'' of life. And I like to think that this is something which is ''in principle'' beyond human power" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,

{{quote|I am also a little puzzled by Watkin's remark that the pain minimizer would have to destroy the ''very possibility'' of life. If the sentient forms of life were totally destroyed, it might be that the sentient forms would be most unlikely to evolve. This is on the supposition, held by some experts, that the evolution of higher forms of life on earth depended on a lot of lucky accidents. If this is not the case, then the benevolent world destroyer should ensure that ''all'' forms of life are destroyed, even bacteria and plants and insects, but should this be impossible the world destroyer might have at least ensured a pain free globe for hundreds of millions of years to come. In any case my brother's example was of a world ''exploder'', and I think this would ensure the destruction of ''all'' life on earth. Of course there might be sentient life on planets of distant stars. No doubt the world exploder can do nothing about this, even with the resources of a future physics, but his or her negative utilitarian duty would not be to do the impossible, but would be to minimize suffering as much as lies within his or her power.{{sfn|Smart|1989||pp=44-45}}}}

=== Getting killed would be a great evil ===
Another related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: "He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them."{{sfn|Kadlec|2008|110}}

=== Frustrated preferences ===
Negative [[preference utilitarianism]] has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions.&lt;ref&gt;"A preferentialist could, for example, claim that most people now living prefer to live, and that these preferences must be counted when elimination is at stake. So, the elimination results in a lot of frustrated preferences, and we must balance the evil ofthis against the evil of the unhappiness in the future of humanity." {{harv|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}} Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}}

The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;"NIPU [negative ideal preference utilitarianism] isn’t about minimizing the amount of unsatisfied preferences that currently exist, but rather about minimizing the total amount of unsatisfied preferences in the (space-time) universe. This includes past preferences." {{harv|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that "instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}. See section "2.1.5 Back to destroying the world, doesn’t NIPU still imply that extinction would be best, because if there will be a lot of people in the future, their unsatisfied preferences combined are worse than the preferences being thwarted by extinction?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining negative utilitarianism with rights ===
A part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,

{{quote|A more direct way to address this problem would be to incorporate a theory of rights, stipulating that in general, policy makers simply have no right to make decisions about whether the lives of others are worth living, or whether they should live or die. Since it is clear that policy makers have no right to kill off the miserable and destitute, this response gains support from our moral intuitions.{{sfn|Wolf|1996|p=278}}}}

Negative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice.{{sfn|Contestabile|Negative Utilitarianism and Justice}} Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims{{sfn|Rawls|1958|p=174}} and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.

== Other works ==
[[Toby Ord]] provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay "Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,"{{sfn|Ord|2013}} to which [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] and Bruno Contestabile have replied.{{sfn|Pearce|A response to Toby Ord's essay}}{{sfn|Contestabile|Why I’m (Not) a Negative Utilitarian – A Review of Toby Ord’s Essay}} Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|2012|pages=1–2}}: "Negative utilitarianism is well-known for entailing anti-natalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud."&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Belshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belshaw|2012|page=118}}: "Negative utilitarianism can be plucked from the shelf, but there is no good reason to suppose it true. And were it true, it would take us too far, generating not only anti-natalism but straightaway also its pro-mortalist neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingmar Persson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|2009|page=38}}: “negative utilitarianism seems implausible, as is shown by an argument sketched by McMahan, on the basis of an argument originally put forward by Richard Sikora (1978). This argument turns on the observation that if what would be bad for individuals in life is a reason against conceiving them, but what would be good for them is no reason in favour of conceiving them, then, as far as those individuals are concerned, it is wrong to conceive them, however much good their lives will contain, provided that they will also contain something that is bad for them. This seems clearly absurd.”&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle

{{quote|is a kind of maximin rule.... The principle also resembles a form of utilitarianism which is familiar from the work of Popper and the Smart brothers, negative utilitarianism. That too suggests we should concern ourselves before all else with the elimination of pain.{{sfn|Mendola|1990|p=86}}}} Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiz|1992|page=423}}: "Utilitarianism failed, but what is sometimes called ‘negative utilitarianism’ avoids many of the shortcomings of classical utilitarianism. It is a good candidate for an ethics that expresses the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian Fricke published the German article "Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus."{{sfn|Fricke|2002}} In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings.{{sfn|Leighton|2011}}

'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human’s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

====Examples====

&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly'' by [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]]; a creation of [[Douglas Adams]]
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturations are to me
As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts
With my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter’s book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.

'''Overqualification''' is the state of being skilled or educated beyond what is necessary for a [[job (role)|job]]. There can often be high costs for companies associated with training [[employee]]s. This could be a problem for professionals applying for a job where they significantly exceed the job requirements because potential employers may feel they are using the position as a stepping stone.

In some societies, overqualification has become increasingly common as the proportion of college graduates in a population grows faster than the proportion of jobs in an economy which actually require college-level skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Jenner| first =Judy| title =Settling in: Recent college graduates overqualified, underemployed| website =Schools.com| publisher =QuinStreet, Inc.| date =5 September 2013| url =http://www.schools.com/articles/recent-college-graduates-overqualified-underemployed.html| accessdate = 30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a euphemism==

The concept of overqualification is often a [[euphemism]] used by employers when they do not want to reveal their true reasons for not hiring an applicant.  The term "overqualified" can mask [[age discrimination]], but it can also mask legitimate concerns of an employer, such as uncertainty of an applicant's ability to do the job, or concerns that they only want a job on a temporary basis, while they seek another more desirable position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2008/08/14/lindgren_overqualified.html "What does ‘overqualified’ mean?", ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', Aug. 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Being overqualified also often means that a person was asking for too high a salary.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/05/31/370688/index.htm|title=Anne Fisher, "'Overqualified' May Be A Smokescreen", ''Fortune'', May 31, 2004.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/20/AR2008122000441.html|title=Vickie Elmer, "Getting an 'Overqualified' Response", ''Washington Post'', Dec. 21, 2008; Page K01.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Overqualified" can also be used to describe a resistance to new [[technologies]], or a [[pompous]] approach.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

In the definition above, which states that an overqualified person may take a job to gain knowledge and leave the company, this could also apply to all other employees of the same company. The term overqualified, in any definition, should be considered as a subjective term developed by the person doing the evaluation of the applicant based upon their point of view which may in itself be biased. There comes a time in a person's life, when a choice is made to reduce the level of responsibility and one could consider the perceived overqualification as "added value" to the company when the applicant is willing to take a lower-level position, accompanied by a lower salary. When the decision is not based upon factual or unbiased factors, discrimination has occurred.

In the United States, the term "overqualified" has been found by the courts to sometimes be used as a "code word for too old" (i.e., age discrimination) in the hiring process.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm v. New York City Office of the Comptroller (D. Ct. NY, March 4, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting less qualified candidates==
The governmental employing institution may have written or unwritten upper qualification limits for a particular position. These limits protect less qualified people like newly graduated students, allowing them to find a job as well. For instance, in countries like Germany or Switzerland, a paid position of a PhD student may normally not be given for an applicant who already has a PhD degree.

Also, a short but successful career may be preferred over longer (so more various different experience) but overall less successful career.

==Responses to being described as overqualified==
Noluthando Crockett-Ntonga recommends that job applicants address potential concerns such as salary requirements in a [[cover letter]] and [[interview]] before the employer makes any comments about overqualification.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Barbara Moses advises applicants who are described as being overqualified to emphasize their willingness to [[mentor]] younger co-workers, and to focus on what attracts them about the position they are applying to rather than emphasizing their ambition or desire to be challenged.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; Being overqualified can be an asset for employers, especially when the breadth of one's experience enables them to take on additional responsibilities in ways that benefit the employer.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

==The PhD==

The [[PhD]] can reflect overspecialization that manifests itself as a lack of perspective; for example, a PhD might not adequately prepare one for careers in development, manufacturing, or technical management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://units.aps.org/units/fiap/newsletters/nov95/03.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421004607/http://units.aps.org/units/fiap/newsletters/nov95/03.cfm |archivedate=April 21, 2008 }} John A. Armstrong, "Rethinking the PhD", originally appeared in ''Issues in Science and Technology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the corporate world, some PhD graduates have been criticized as being unable to turn theories into useful strategies and being unable to work on a team, although PhDs are seen as desirable and even essential in many positions, such as supervisory roles in research, especially PhDs in [[biomedical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22107688_ITM|title=Lee Anna Jackson, "Past the prestige: what career options does your Ph.D. offer?(Making Connections)", ''Black Enterprise'', Aug. 1, 2004.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in some college jobs, people can associate negative factors with the PhD, including a lack of focus on [[teaching]], overspecialization, and an undesirable set of professional priorities, often focusing on self-promotion.  These forces have led both to an increase in some educational institutions hiring candidates without PhDs as well as a focus on the development of other doctoral degrees, such as the D.A. or [[Doctor of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.ade.org/ade/bulletin/n027/027004.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071020004552/http://web2.ade.org/ade/bulletin/n027/027004.htm |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }} Edmond L. Volpe, "A Portrait of the PhD as a Failure", ''ADE Bulletin'', 027 (November 1970): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some employers have reservations about hiring people with PhDs in full-time, entry-level positions but are eager to hire them in temporary positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Breaking-In-as-a-Temp/45219 Susan Basalla May, "Behind the Ivory Tower: Breaking In as a Temp", ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this reservation is rather a reaction associated with job insecurity, especially in situations where most of the company leaders hold lower qualifications than the PhD; as part of the wide phenomenon of [[credential creep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mauno|first=Saija|title=Multi-wave, multi-variable models of job insecurity: applying different scales in studying the stability of job insecurity|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~mgto650r/clee/Day_2_reading_material/multi-wave.pdf|work=Journal of Organizational Behavior|author2=Leskinen, Esko|author3=Kinnunen, Ulla|pages=919–937|doi=10.1002/job.122|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032218/http://teaching.ust.hk/~mgto650r/clee/Day_2_reading_material/multi-wave.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Infrasound]]''' is sound at frequencies lower than the low frequency end of human hearing threshold at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. It is known, however, that humans can perceive sounds below this frequency at very high pressure levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yeowart |first=N. S. |author2=M. J. Evans |title=Thresholds of audibility for very low-frequency pure tones |journal=[[J. Acoust. Soc.

Low frequency sounds can travel for long distances with very little attenuation and can be detected hundreds of miles away from their sources.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kreithen |first=M. L. |author2=D. B. Quine |title=Infrasound detection by the homing pigeon: A behavioral audiogram |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1979 |volume=129 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1007/bf00679906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langbauer |first=W.

== Mammals ==

The production and perception of infrasound has been observed in multiple mammals, including whale, elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros. For most of these animals, observations are preliminary and their sensitivity to infrasound has not been quantified. If an animal produces a low frequency sound, and uses it in communication, it suggests the animal might also be sensitive to infrasound.

=== Elephants ===

Elephants are the terrestrial animal in which the production of infrasonic calls was first noted by M. Krishnan,&lt;ref name="Krishnan 1972"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krishnan |first=M |title=An Ecological Survey of the Larger Mammals of Peninsular India |year=1972 |journal=The Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume=69 |pages=26–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; later discovered by Katy Payne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Katy |title=Silent Thunder: In the presence of Elephants |year=1998 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of low frequency sounds to communicate over long distances may explain certain elephant behaviors that have previously puzzled observers. Elephant groups that are separated by several kilometers have been observed to travel in parallel or to change the direction simultaneously and move directly towards each other in order to meet.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langbauer |first=W. R. |author2=K. B. Payne |author3=R. A. Charif |author4=L. Rapaport |author5=F. Osborn |title=African elephants respond to distant playbacks of low-frequency conspecific calls |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |year=1991 |volume=157 |pages=35–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of [[estrus]] for females is asynchronous, lasts only for a few days, and occurs only every several years. Nevertheless, males, which usually wander apart from female groups, rapidly gather from many directions to compete for a receptive female.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Since infrasound can travel for very long distances, it has been suggested that calls in the infrasonic range might be important for long distance communication for such coordinated behaviors among separated elephants.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payne |first=K. B. |author2=W. R. Langbauer |author3=E. M. Thomas |title=Infrasonic calls of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus |journal=Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |year=1986 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=297–301 |doi=10.1007/bf00300007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Infrasound production and perception ====

Recordings and playback experiments support that elephants use the infrasonic components of their calls for communication. Infrasonic vocalizations have been recorded from captive elephants in many different situations. The structure of the calls varies greatly but most of them range in frequency from 14 to 24&amp;nbsp;Hz, with durations of 10–15 seconds. When the nearest elephant is 5 m from the microphone, the recorded sound pressure levels can be 85 to 90&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; Some of these calls are completely inaudible to humans, while others have audible components that are probably due to higher frequency [[harmonics]] of below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz fundamentals.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; Sometimes, vocalizations cause perceptible rumbles that are accompanied by a fluttering of the skin on the calling elephant’s forehead where the nasal passage enters the skull. This fluttering can also occur without causing any perceptible sound, suggesting the production of a purely infrasonic call.&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; The mechanism of infrasonic call production in elephants has not been determined.

Playback experiments using prerecorded elephant vocalizations show that elephants can perceive infrasound and how they respond to these stimuli. In playback experiments, certain behaviors that occur commonly after vocalizations are scored before and after a call is played. These behaviors include lifting and stiffening of ears, vocalization, walking or running towards the concealed speaker, clustering in a tight group, and remaining motionless ("freezing"), with occasional scanning movements of the head.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt; The occurrence of such behaviors consistently increases after the playing of a call, whether it is a full-bandwidth playback or a playback in which most of the energy above 25&amp;nbsp;Hz was filtered out. This filtering shows that the behaviorally significant information of the call is contained in the infrasonic range, and it also simulates the effect of frequency-dependent attenuation over distance as it might occur in the wild.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt; Behavioral responses do not increase for pure tone stimuli that are similar to recorded infrasonic calls in frequency and intensity. This shows that the responses are specifically to signals that were meaningful to the elephants.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;

The use of prerecorded playbacks and behavioral scoring also shows that the infrasonic elephant calls are behaviorally significant over long distances. The degree of response behaviors performed by an elephant group, such as lifting of ears, walking towards the speakers, “freezing”, or scanning movements, was compared visually before and after the presentation of a stimulus, scoring a trial as a positive response if the amount of behaviors is greater after the stimulus. In one particular experiment performed on elephants living in the wild, the presentation of playbacks for 20–40 seconds from loudspeakers at distances of 1.2&amp;nbsp;km and 2&amp;nbsp;km caused a significant increase in response behaviors.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Since the playbacks were done at half the amplitude at which they were recorded, it is estimated that these calls would be perceptible by elephants at distances of at least 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Even this may be an underestimate because animals do not respond every time they perceive a conspecific call, and they are probably less likely to respond to calls from further distances even if they do perceive them.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;

There are some confounding factors that might influence the results of this kind of experiment. Firstly, the animals might actually be more sensitive than the experiments would indicate owing to [[habituation]] of the animals to the playback stimuli after several trial repetitions. To avoid this, researchers present several different types of playbacks in random order. Another problem that might arise in interpreting field experiments done on groups of animals is that animals may be responding to signals from other elephants in the group rather than the playback stimulus. However, an assumption is made that at least one animal in the group did perceive and respond directly to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;

==== Infrasound sensitivity ====

The auditory sensitivity thresholds have been measured behaviorally for one individual young female Indian elephant. The [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] test for sensitivity requires the elephant to respond to a stimulus by pressing a button with its trunk, which results in a sugar water reward if the elephant correctly identified the appropriate stimulus occurrence.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heffner |first=H. |author2=R. Heffner |title=Hearing in the elephant (Elephas maximus) |journal=Science |year=1980 |volume=208 |pages=518–520 |doi=10.1126/science.7367876 |pmid=7367876 |issue=4443 |bibcode=1980Sci...208..518H}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine auditory sensitivity thresholds, a certain frequency of sound is presented at various intensities to see at which intensity the stimulus ceases to evoke a response. The auditory sensitivity curve of this particular elephant began at 16&amp;nbsp;Hz with a threshold of 65&amp;nbsp;dB. A shallow slope decreased to the best response at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz with a threshold of 8&amp;nbsp;dB, followed by a steep threshold increase above 4&amp;nbsp;kHz. According to the 60&amp;nbsp;dB cut-off, the upper limit was 10.5&amp;nbsp;kHz with absolutely no detectable response at 14&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; The upper limit for humans is considered to be 18&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper and lower limits of elephant hearing are the lowest measured for any animals aside from the pigeon.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; By contrast, the average best frequency for animal hearing is 9.8&amp;nbsp;kHz, the average upper limit is 55&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

The ability to differentiate frequencies of two successive tones was also tested for this elephant using a similar conditioning paradigm. The elephant’s responses were somewhat erratic, which is typical for mammals in this test.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; Nevertheless, the ability to discriminate sounds was best at frequencies below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz particularly at measurements of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz and 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

Tests of the ability to localize sounds also showed the significance of low frequency sound perception in elephants. Localization was tested by observing the successful orienting towards the left or the right source loudspeakers when they were positioned at different angles from the elephant’s head. The elephant could localize sounds best at a frequency below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, with perfect identification of the left or right speaker at angles of 20 degrees or more, and chance level discriminations below 2 degrees.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; Sound localization ability was measured to be best at 125&amp;nbsp;Hz and 250&amp;nbsp;Hz, intermediate at 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, and very poor at frequencies at 4&amp;nbsp;kHz and above.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; A possible reason for this is that elephants are very good at using [[interaural phase differences]] which are effective for localizing low frequency sounds, but not as good at using [[interaural intensity difference]]s which are better for higher frequency sounds. Because of the elephant head size and the large distance between their ears, interaural difference cues become confused when wavelengths are shorter, explaining why sound localization was very poor at frequencies above 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; It was observed that the elephant spread the pinna of its ears only during the sound localization tasks, however the precise effect of this behavior is unknown.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

== Birds ==

Although birds do not produce vocalizations in the infrasonic range, reactions to infrasonic stimuli have been observed in several species, such as the homing pigeon, the guinea fowl, and the Asian grouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yodlowski |first=M.

=== Pigeons ===

Infrasound perception has been observed and quantified in the homing pigeon which has particularly good long distance navigation skills. The precise relevance of such signals for the pigeon is still unknown, but several uses for infrasound have been hypothesized, such as navigation and detection of air turbulences when flying and landing.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=D. R. |title=The physiology and geophysics of bird navigation |journal=Q Rev Biol |year=1969 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=255–276 |doi=10.1086/406142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schermuly |first=L. |author2=R.

==== Infrasound sensitivity ====

In experiments using heart-rate conditioning, Pigeons have been found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. For frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55&amp;nbsp;dB which is at least 50&amp;nbsp;dB more sensitive than humans.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to a 7% shift at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt; Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate conditioning test. In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird’s heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delius |first=J. D. |author2=R. M. Tarpy |title=Stimulus control of heart rate by auditory frequency and auditory pattern in pigeons |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |year=1974 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=297–306 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1974.21-297 |pmid=4815397 |pmc=1333197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon’s sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient noise. Infrasonic stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the tone burst stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;

In order to use infrasound for navigation, it is necessary to be able to localize the source of the sounds. The known mechanisms for sound localizations make use of the time difference cues at the two ears. However, infrasound has such long wavelengths that these mechanisms would not be effective for an animal the size of a pigeon. An alternative method that has been hypothesized is through the use of the [[Doppler shift]].&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt; A Doppler shift occurs when there is relative motion between a sound source and a perceiver and slightly shifts the perceived frequency of the sound. When a flying bird is changing direction, the amplitude of the Doppler shift between it and an infrasonic source would change, enabling the bird to locate the source. This kind of mechanism would require the ability to detect very small changes in frequency. A pigeon typically flies at 20&amp;nbsp;km/hr, so a turn could cause up to a 12% modulation of an infrasonic stimulus. According to response measurements, pigeons are able to distinguish frequency changes of 1-7% in the infrasonic range, showing that the use of Doppler shifts for infrasound localization may be within the pigeon’s perceptive capabilities.&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt;

In early experiments with infrasound sensitivity in pigeons, surgical removal of the calumella, a bone that links the [[tympanic membrane]] to the [[inner ear]], in each ear severely reduced the ability to respond to infrasound, increasing the sensitivity threshold by about 50&amp;nbsp;dB. Complete surgical removal of the entire [[cochlea]], lagena, and calumellae completely abolishes any response to infrasound.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; This shows that the receptors for infrasonic stimuli may be located in the inner ear.

==== Infrasound sensitive nerve fibers ====

Neural fibers that are sensitive to infrasonic stimuli have been identified in the pigeon and their characteristics have been studied. It turns out that, although these fibers also originate in the inner ear, they are quite different from normal acoustic fibers. 
Infrasound sensitive fibers have very high rates of spontaneous discharge, with a mean of 115imp/s, which is much higher than the spontaneous discharge of other auditory fibers.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Recordings show that discharge rates do not increase in response to infrasound stimuli but are modulated at levels comparable to the behavioral thresholds.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Modulation depth is dependent on stimulus frequency and intensity. The modulation is phase locked so that the discharge rate increases during one phase of the stimulus and decreases during the other, leaving the mean discharge rate constant.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Such pulse-frequency modulation allows the stimulus analysis to be independent of the peripheral tuning of the [[basilar membrane]] or the [[hair cells]], which is already poor at low auditory frequencies.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Unlike other acoustic fibers, infrasonic fibers do not show any indication of being tuned to a particular characteristic frequency.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt;

By injecting fibers that were identified to be sensitive to infrasound with HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase), the location and morphology of the stained fibers can be observed in sections under a microscope. Infrasound sensitive fibers are found to be simple bipolar cells in the [[auditory ganglion]] with a diameter of 1.6-2.2&amp;nbsp;µm at the axon and 0.9-1.2&amp;nbsp;µm at the dendrites.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schermuly |first=L. |author2=R. Klinke |title=Origin of infrasound sensitive neurones in the papilla basilaris of the pigeon: an HRP study |journal=Hearing Research |year=1990 |volume=48 |pages=69–78 |doi=10.1016/0378-5955(90)90199-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originate in the apical end of the cochlea and they are located near fibers that transmit low frequency sounds in the acoustic range. Unlike the ordinary acoustic fibers which terminate on the neural limbus, the infrasonic ones terminate on cells on the free basilar membrane.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; Furthermore, infrasonic fibers terminate on 2-9 hair cells while normal acoustic fibers connect to only one.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; Such characteristics would make these fibers analogous to fibers connecting to the outer hair cells in mammals, except that mammalian outer hair cells are known to have efferent fibers only and no afferents.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; These observations suggest that the infrasound sensitive fibers are in a class separate from ordinary acoustic fibers.

: &lt;math&gt;f \colon (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Pointed sets may be regarded as a rather simple [[algebraic structure]].

The category of pointed sets and pointed maps is isomorphic to the [[co-slice category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1} \downarrow \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; is a singleton set.&lt;ref name="joy"/&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name="BorceuxBourn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis Borceux|author2=Dominique Bourn|title=Mal'cev, Protomodular, Homological and Semi-Abelian Categories|year=2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1961-6|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the algebraic characterization, since the unique map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1} \to \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; extends the [[commutative triangle]]s defining arrows of the coslice category to form the [[commutative square]]s defining homomorphisms of the algebras.

The category of pointed sets and pointed maps has both products and co-products, but it is not a [[distributive category]]. It is also an example of a category where &lt;math&gt;0 \times A&lt;/math&gt; is not isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LawvereSchanuel2009"/&gt;

Many algebraic structures are pointed sets in a rather trivial way.

'''Political criticism''' (also referred to as '''political commentary''' or '''political discussion''') is [[criticism]] that is specific of or relevant to [[politics]], including [[policies]], [[politicians]], [[political parties]], and types of [[government]].

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over the relevance and importance of political criticism in civilizations, particularly [[democratic societies]].

Advocates argue that political discussion creates and promotes the variety of opinions necessary for a true democracy. The [[American constitution]] is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as [[free speech]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Critics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual  basis, the "Average Joe") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient [[intelligence]] to do the matter justice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Methods==
There are many methods used throughout [[written history|history]] of promoting political opinions and with the development of new  [[technologies]] new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:

===Books===
[[Image:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|[[The Bible]], one of the most influential books of all time]]
Throughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably '''the''' most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as [[the Bible]], [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], the [[Qur'an]], ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of [[writing]]. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from [[common sense]], the drive of [[literature]] and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the [[emotions|emotional impact]] of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] concerning American views about [[slavery]]. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", derives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Television and films===
Since their development in this past century, both [[television]] and [[films]] have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]], [[Citizen Kane]], the works of [[Walt Disney]], and such political [[satire]] as that found in [[The Simpsons]]. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political [[propaganda]] on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.

===Political cartoons===
{{Main|Political satire}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:conscripcartoon.jpg|thumb|150px|Editorial cartoon concerning [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s freedom from his [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription promise]] by [[Johnny Canuck]].]] --&gt;
[[Political cartoons]] (also known as "editorial cartoons") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a [[:wikt:verbal|verbal]] but a [[visual]] one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful  [[symbols]] or [[metaphors]] in order to communicate the artist's messages.

===News===
Since many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by [[news media|the media]], the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of [[newspapers]], news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.

===Internet===
With the recent invention of the [[Internet]], political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the [[World Wide Web]]. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.

The many means of exchanging ideas, including [[blogs]] and [[internet forum]]s, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute.  This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that [[political parties]] stay connected to [[Electoral district|constituents]].

A '''radiosonde''' is a battery-powered [[telemetry]] instrument carried into the atmosphere usually by a [[weather balloon]] that measures various [[Atmospheric sounding|atmospheric parameters]] and transmits them by radio to a ground receiver. Modern radiosondes measure or calculate the following variables: [[altitude]], [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], [[wind]] (both [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]]), [[cosmic ray]] readings at high altitude and [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical position]] ([[latitude]]/[[longitude]]). Radiosondes measuring [[ozone]] concentration are known as ozonesondes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ozonelayer.noaa.gov/action/ozonesonde.htm| author=Karin L. Gleason| title=Ozonesonde| work=noaa.gov| publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| date=March 20, 2008| accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiosondes may operate at a [[radio frequency]] of 403 [[Hertz|MHz]] or 1680&amp;nbsp;MHz.  A radiosonde whose position is tracked as it ascends to give wind speed and direction information is called a '''rawinsonde''' ("radar wind -sonde").&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web

A radiosonde that is dropped from an airplane and falls, rather than being carried by a balloon is called a ''[[dropsonde]]''.  Radiosondes are an essential source of [[meteorological]] data, and hundreds are launched all over the world daily.

== History ==

[[File:Launching radiosonde 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|US sailors launching a radiosonde during World War 2]]

The first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and [[Thermo-hygrograph|meteographs]], a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment. This proved to be difficult because the kites were linked to the ground and were very difficult to manoeuvre in gusty conditions. Furthermore, the sounding was limited to low altitudes because of the link to the ground.

[[Gustave Hermite]] and [[Georges Besançon]], from France, were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph. In 1898, [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] organized at the ''Observatoire de Météorologie Dynamique de [[Trappes]]'' the first regular daily use of these balloons. Data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude, which varied with the season, and then stabilized above this altitude. De Bort's discovery of the [[tropopause]] and [[stratosphere]] was announced in 1902 at the French Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="MF2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, like [[Richard Aßmann]] and [[William Henry Dines]], were working at the same times with similar instruments.

In 1924, Colonel William Blaire in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Signal Corps]] did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon, making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits. The first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in France by {{Interlanguage link|Robert Bureau|fr}}. Bureau coined the name "radiosonde" and flew the first instrument on January 7, 1929.&lt;ref name="MF2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MF3"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed independently a year later, [[Pavel Molchanov]] flew a radiosonde on January 30, 1930. Molchanov's design became a popular standard because of its simplicity and because it converted sensor readings to [[Morse code]], making it easy to use without special equipment or training.&lt;ref name="ssht"&gt;DuBois, Multhauf and Ziegler, "The Invention and Development of the Radiosonde", ''Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology'', No. 53, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with a modified Molchanov sonde, Sergey Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude. On April 1, 1935, he took measurements up to {{convert|13.6|km|abbr=on}} using a pair of [[Geiger counter]]s in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers.&lt;ref name="ssht"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, S. "Radio-Transmission of Cosmic Ray Data from the Stratosphere", ''Nature'', June 29, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; This became an important technique in the field, and Vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years, measuring the radiation's latitude dependence caused by the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

In 1936, the U.S. Navy assigned the [[U.S. Bureau of Standards|U.S. Bureau of Standards (NBS)]] to develop an official radiosonde for the Navy to use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/2453/SSHT-0053_Lo_res.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Invention and Development of the Radiosonde, with a Catalog of Upper-Atmospheric Telemetering Probes in the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|last=DuBois|first=John|date=2002|work=|access-date=July 13, 2018|publisher=Smithsonian Institute Press|last2=Multhauf|first2=Robert|last3=Ziegler|first3=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBS gave the project to [[Harry Diamond (engineer)|Harry Diamond]], who had previously worked on radio navigation and invented a blind landing system for airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillmor|first=Stewart|date=December 26, 1989|title=Seventy Years of Radio Science, Technology, Standards, and Measurement at the National Bureau of Standards|journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union|volume=70|issue=52|pages=1571|doi=10.1029/89EO00403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization led by Diamond eventually (in 1992) became a part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]. In 1937, Diamond, along with his associates Francis Dunmore and Wilbur Hinmann, Jr., created a radiosonde that employed audio-frequency subcarrier modulation with the help of a resistance-capacity relaxation oscillator. In addition, this NBS radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=E.T.|date=September 1941|title=The radiosonde: The stratosphere laboratory|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001600324190950X|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=232|issue=3|pages=217–238|archive-url=https://kundoc.com/pdf-the-radiosonde-the-stratosphere-laboratory-.html|archive-date=July 13, 2018|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde, which prompted the first service use of the NBS radiosondes in the Navy. Then in 1939, Diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “remote weather station,” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hrizEY2BWOoC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=the+invention+of+the+radiosonde+harry+diamond#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20invention%20of%20the%20radiosonde%20harry%20diamond&amp;f=false|title=A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology|last=Lide|first=David|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=9780849312472|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, the NBS radiosonde system included a pressure drive, which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also gathered data on cloud thickness and light intensity in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nistdigitalarchives.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16009coll19/id/1458/rec/11|title=NBS radio meteorographs :: Historic Photographs Collection|website=nistdigitalarchives.contentdm.oclc.org|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this and other improvements in cost (about $25), weight (&gt; 1 kilogram), and accuracy, hundreds of thousands of NBS-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes, and the apparatus was officially adopted by the U.S. Weather Bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Diamond was given the Washington Academy of Sciences Engineering Award in 1940 and the IRE Fellow Award (which was later renamed the Harry Diamond Memorial Award) in 1943 for his contributions to radio-meteorology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeeusa.org/volunteers/awards-recognition/technical-achievement-awards/harry-diamond-award/harry-diamond-award-recipients/|title=Harry Diamond Memorial Award - Past Recipients - IEEE-USA|website=ieeeusa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of economically important government [[weather forecasting]] services during the 1930s and their increasing need for data motivated many nations to begin regular radiosonde observation programs

In 1985, as part of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Vega program]], the two [[Venus]] probes, [[Vega 1]] and [[Vega 2]], each dropped a radiosonde into the [[atmosphere of Venus]]. The sondes were tracked for two days.

Although modern [[remote sensing]] by satellites, aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data, none of these systems can match the vertical resolution ({{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} or less) and altitude coverage ({{convert|30|km|abbr=on}}) of radiosonde observations, so they remain essential to modern meteorology.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

Although hundreds of radiosondes are launched worldwide each day year-round, fatalities  attributed to  radiosondes are rare. The first know example was the electrocution of a lineman in the United States who was attempting to free a radiosonde from high-tension power lines in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;"Linemen Cautioned About Disengaging Radiosonde," Electrical World, 15 May 1943&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://radiosondemuseum.com/wp-content/gallery/mags/1943-radiosonde-fatality.jpg{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 an [[Antonov 24]] operating [[Aeroflot Flight 1661]] suffered a loss of control after striking a radiosonde in flight resulting in the death of all 45 people on board.

== Operation ==
A [[rubber]] or [[latex]] balloon filled with either [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]] lifts the device up through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. The maximum altitude to which the balloon ascends is determined by the diameter and thickness of the balloon. Balloon sizes can range from {{convert|100|to|3000|g|abbr=on}}. As the balloon ascends through the atmosphere, the pressure decreases, causing the balloon to expand. Eventually, the balloon will expand to the extent that its skin will break, terminating the ascent. An {{convert|800|g|abbr=on}} balloon will burst at about {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dian J. Gaffen. [http://www.aero.jussieu.fr/~sparc/News12/Radiosondes.html Radiosonde Observations and Their Use in SPARC-Related Investigations.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607142822/http://www.aero.jussieu.fr/~sparc/News12/Radiosondes.html |date=June 7, 2007 }} Retrieved on 2008-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  After bursting, a small [[parachute]] on the radiosonde's support line carries it to Earth.  A typical radiosonde flight lasts 60 to 90 minutes.  One radiosonde from [[Clark Air Base]], Philippines, reached an altitude of {{convert|155092|ft|abbr=on}}.

The modern radiosonde communicates via radio with a computer that stores all the variables in real time. The first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a [[theodolite]], and gave only a wind estimation by the position. With the advent of radar by the Signal Corps it was possible to track a radar target carried by the balloons with the [[SCR-658 radar]]. Modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction, such as a [[radio direction finder]] or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The weight of a radiosonde is typically {{convert|250|g|abbr=on}}.

Sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon. Radiosondes deployed in this way are called [[dropsonde]]s.

== Routine radiosonde launches ==
Worldwide there are about 1,300 radiosonde launch sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/Gos-components.html#upper WMO Global Observing System]''Upper-air observations''. Retrieved February 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries share data with the rest of the world through international agreements. Nearly all routine radiosonde launches occur 45 minutes before the official observation time of 0000 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] and 1200 UTC, so as to provide an instantaneous snapshot of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh3/text/chapter3.htm Preflight Procedures and Success Criteria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121011204/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh3/text/chapter3.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important for [[numerical weather prediction|numerical modeling]]. In the United States the [[National Weather Service]] is tasked with providing timely upper-air observations for use in [[weather forecasting]], [[severe weather]] [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|watches and warnings]], and atmospheric research. The National Weather Service launches radiosondes from 92 stations in North America and the [[Pacific Islands]] twice daily. It also supports the operation of 10 radiosonde sites in the [[Caribbean]].

== Uses of upper air observations ==
Raw upper air data is routinely ingested by numerical models. Forecasters often view the data in a graphical format, plotted on [[thermodynamic diagrams]] such as [[Skew-T log-P diagram]]s, [[Tephigram]]s, and or [[Stüve diagram]]s, all useful for the interpretation of the atmosphere's vertical [[thermodynamics]] profile of temperature and moisture as well as [[kinematics]] of vertical wind profile.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction. Because a sonde may drift several hundred kilometers during the 90- to 120-minute flight, there may be concern that this could introduce problems into the model initialization.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, this appears not to be so except perhaps locally in [[jet stream]] regions in the stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ams.allenpress.com/pdfserv/10.1175%2FJCLI3804.1 Dead link]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''social construction of disability''' is the idea that society and its institutions have the power to construct disability around social expectations of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea argues that disability is construction based on several localized social expectations. For example, in the medieval period disability was constructed around a person's moral behavior. Disability was seen as divine punishment or a side effect of a moral failing being physically or biologically different was not enough to be considered disabled. Only until the European Enlightenment did society change its definition of disability to be more related to biology. However these biological definitions of health centered around what is considered to be healthy for most Western Europeans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Around the year 1970, in North America various groups including sociologists, disabled people, and disabled focused political groups began to pull away from the accepted medical lens of viewing disability. These groups began to discuss things like oppression, civil rights, and accessibility. This change in discourse resulted in conceptualizations of disability that was rooted in social constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Overview===
Canada and the United States have operated under the premise that social assistance benefits should not exceed the amount of money that can be earned through labor in order to give citizens an incentive to search for and maintain employment. This has led to widespread poverty amongst disabled citizens. In the 1950s, disability pensions were established and included various forms of direct economic assistance; however, these amounts were set at exceedingly low monetary levels. Since the 1970s, both governments have viewed unemployed disabled citizens as excess labor due to continuous high rates of unemployment and have made minimal attempts to increase employment, which keeps disabled people at poverty- level incomes due to the ‘incentive’ principle. Poverty is the most debilitating circumstance handicapped people face, resulting in the inability to afford proper medical, technological and other assistance necessary to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book|last=Wendell|first=Wendell|title=The Social Construction of Disability|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=1996 |pages=60|url=http://moodle.fhs.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/19118/mod_resource/content/0/Wendell_Social_construction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and public policy===
Laws have helped to recognize disability as a social construct rather than simply physical impairment. In 1776, the Continental Congress passed the first national law regarding wounded soldiers. Rather than stating attitudes towards disability, the act proposed that how the US viewed disability was closely linked to its views about the worth of the soldiers. This segment of the Act contains a few inferences which relate to disability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas, in the course of the present war, some commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the army and navy, as also private soldiers, marines, and seamen, may lose a limb, or be otherwise so disabled as to prevent their serving in the army or navy, or getting their livelihood, and may stand in need of relief[.]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liachowitz|first=Claire|title=Disability as a Social Construct|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=22–23|isbn=0-8122-8134-9}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this resolution related disability to “getting a livelihood,” it also implies through the recognition of an additional connection to serving in the military that disability is not just a failure to function properly but rather built systemically through the ability to function in certain settings. Also, this resolution states that disability is not only based upon physical capabilities and societal roles but social aspects as well.

The [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA) is a prime example of how laws have changed the societal roles of disabled people. The Act was signed by President Bush in July 1990. It prohibited the discrimination of disabled people by employers and also required that mass transportation, commercial buildings and public accommodations be accessible to disabled people. After the law was passed, Congress realized that many people with disabilities were secluded from society and could not live independently. Before the ADA was made into a law, disabled people could not land a job, enter a restaurant or store, or access the bus. A 1986 poll revealed that 66 percent of disabled citizens were jobless, in spite of the fact that many proclaimed they desired and were capable of employment. The same poll showed that 40 percent of handicapped people could not find a job due to the inaccessibility of transportation and public places. As a result of implementation of the ADA, 6&amp;nbsp;million private businesses and 80,000 state and local governments made their facilities available to the disabled. In July 1992, the provisions of the Act incorporating 43&amp;nbsp;million disabled individuals in to the workforce were set into motion. Many business owners realized that the changes made to their establishment were of little financial consequence, typically under $500. The conditions of disabled people before and after this law was passed are examples of how society constructs disability through discrimination and physical barriers. By eliminating these obstacles, the disabled are more integrated into society.&lt;ref&gt;Stalcup, pp. 17, 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of disability==
In the United States, according to the [[Social Security Administration]], to be considered "disabled," a claimant must provide medical evidence displaying proof of and severity of the impairment(s). Medical evidence comes from sources that have treated or evaluated the claimant for his/her impairment(s). Acceptable medical sources include medical professionals including licensed physicians, licensed or certified psychologists, licensed optometrists (only for purposes of establishing visual disorders), licensed podiatrists (only for purposes of establishing impairments of the foot and/or ankle), and qualified speech-language pathologists (only for purposes of establishing speech or language impairments). Qualified speech-language pathologists must be licensed by the State education in the State in which he/she practices, or hold a Certificate of clinical Competence from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/evidentiary.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part II - Evidentiary Requirements. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying for disability (and the assessment of) can take place in person at the Social Security field office, by telephone, by mail, or by filing online. The application process involves supplying a description of the impairment, treatment sources, and other information. A field office then verifies non-medical eligibility requirement (including age, employment, marital status, or Social Security coverage information) and sends the case to the state agency ([[Disability Determination Services]], or DDS) for evaluation (DDS are state agencies that develop medical evidence and deciding whether or not a claimant - the person requesting disability benefits - is disabled or blind under the law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/general-info.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part I - General Information. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Paralympics===
Since the invention of the television in the early 1900s, this medium has held a pervasive influence on our outlook on many aspects of society, disability being one of them. One example is how the 2000 Paralympics versus the Olympics were televised. The 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, one of the biggest in history, was barely acknowledged by mainstream media prior to the event. The Sydney Paralympic organizers worked extensively to try to solicit coverage of the Games. For more than two years, they negotiated with Channel 7 to broadcast the competitions. Channel 7 proposed that if the Paralympics paid them $3&amp;nbsp;million in case of lack of advertising revenue they would agree to broadcast the event. Eventually, the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and Channel 7 announced they would be broadcasting the Games and Channel 7 would “complement” the coverage with a highlights package that ran daily on its pay-TV Channel. ABC also promised to broadcast at least 60&amp;nbsp;minutes of daily highlights. Later on, ABC finally agreed to air a live broadcast of the opening and closing ceremonies. The opening and closing ceremonies were actually quite popular amongst viewers, watched by 2.5&amp;nbsp;million; however the rest of the games proved to be quite the opposite. While the Olympics were covered live throughout the entire event, the Paralympics apparently was not important enough to deserve the same live coverage before the initial showing. By deeming the disabled to be less important than those without disabilities and by separating the Olympics and Paralympics, disability is socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Over the last several decades, technology has transformed networks, services, and communication, and promoted convergence of telecommunications, computer use, etc. Technology changes, or, the [[Digital Revolution]], has changed how people work, learn, and interact. The digital revolution has directed people to use computers, cell phones, and other technologies more and more. However, many people who use such technology experience a form of disability. Even if it is not physically visible, those with, for example, cognitive impairments, hand tremors, vision impairments, have some form of disability that don't allow them to be able to fully access technology the way that those without a "technological disability" do.

===Education===
Special education "...is a social construction whereby a society can label a group in order to isolate responsibility for that group's welfare and thereby protect normal sources of power. In education, society has created many social categories, including learning disabilities. Such social categories represent the structure of society. The success of special educations students who have learning disabilities seems to be measured in material terms; but if they don't have the opportunity to achieve this success, it is hard to turn to the American community for support, as so many people in this community condemn them for their differences.

Thus, education tries to restore the idea of a moral community, one in which the members question what constitutes a good life, to form a reconceptualization of education, where physical and mental conditions would be seen as part of a range of abilities, where different talents were distributed in different ways, and all talents would be recognized. All students would be included in the educational network instead of being set apart as special cases, and it would be acknowledged that all humans have special needs and no one is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capper|first=Colleen|title=Educational Administration in a Pluralistic Society|publisher=State University of New York Pr|date=July 1993|pages=173–174, 176–177|isbn=978-0791413739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a [[semigroup]] is a [[nonempty set]] together with an [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. A '''special class of semigroups'''  is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[semigroup]]s satisfying additional [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or conditions. Thus the class of [[commutative]] semigroups consists of all those semigroups in which the binary operation satisfies the commutativity property that ''ab'' = ''ba'' for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' in the semigroup.
The class of [[Finite set|finite]] semigroups consists of those semigroups for which the [[underlying set]] has finite [[cardinality]]. Members of the class of [[Brandt semigroup]]s are required to satisfy not just one condition but a set of additional properties. A large collection of special classes of semigroups have been defined though not all of them have been studied equally intensively.

In the [[algebra]]ic [[theory]] of semigroups, in constructing special classes, attention is focused only on those properties, restrictions and conditions which can be expressed in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups and occasionally on the cardinality and similar properties of [[subset]]s of the [[underlying set]].  The underlying [[set (mathematics)|sets]] are not assumed to carry any other mathematical [[structure]]s like [[Partial order|order]] or [[topology]].

As in any algebraic theory,  one of the main problems of the theory of semigroups is the [[classification theorems|classification]] of all semigroups and a complete description of their structure. In the case of semigroups, since the binary operation is required to satisfy only the associativity property the problem of classification is considered extremely difficult. Descriptions of structures have been obtained for certain special classes of semigroups. For example, the structure of the sets of idempotents of regular semigroups is completely known. Structure descriptions are presented in terms of better known types of semigroups. The best known type of semigroup is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

A (necessarily incomplete) list of various special classes of semigroups is presented below. To the extent possible the defining properties are formulated in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups. The references point to the locations from where the defining properties are sourced.

== List of special classes of semigroups ==
The third column states whether this set of semigroups forms a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]]. And whether the set of finite semigroups of this special class forms a [[variety of finite semigroups]]. Note that if this set is a variety, its set of finite elements is automatically a variety of finite semigroups.

{{star nav}}

In [[astronomy]], '''stellar classification''' is the classification of [[star]]s based on their [[stellar spectrum|spectral]] characteristics. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a [[prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] into a [[spectrum]] exhibiting the [[Continuum (spectrum)|rainbow]] of colors interspersed with [[spectral line]]s. Each line indicates a particular [[chemical element]] or [[molecule]], with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the [[photosphere]], although in some cases there are true abundance differences. The ''spectral class'' of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the [[ionization]] state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature.

Most stars are currently classified under the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system using the letters ''O'', ''B'', ''A'', ''F'', ''G'', ''K'', and ''M'', a sequence from the hottest (''O'' type) to the coolest (''M'' type). Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with ''0'' being hottest and ''9'' being coolest (e.g. A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler). The sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system, such as class&amp;nbsp;''D'' for [[white dwarf]]s and classes&amp;nbsp;''S'' and ''C'' for [[carbon star]]s.

In the MK system, a [[luminosity class]] is added to the spectral class using [[Roman numerals]]. This is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star's spectrum, which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs. Luminosity class&amp;nbsp;''0'' or ''Ia+'' is used for ''hypergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''I'' for ''supergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''II'' for bright ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''III'' for regular ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''IV'' for ''sub-giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''V'' for ''[[main-sequence]] stars'', class&amp;nbsp;''sd'' (or ''VI'') for ''sub-dwarfs'', and class&amp;nbsp;''D'' (or ''VII'') for ''white dwarfs''. The full spectral class for the [[Sun]] is then G2V, indicating a main-sequence star with a temperature around 5,800&amp;nbsp;K.

==Conventional color description==
{{Main|Green star (astronomy)}}
[[File:TernaryColorTmap.PNG|thumb|Just-saturated RGB-camera discs]]

The conventional color description takes into account only the peak of the stellar spectrum. In actuality, however, stars radiate in all parts of the spectrum. Because all spectral colors combined appear white, the actual apparent colors the human eye would observe are far lighter than the conventional color descriptions would suggest. This characteristic of 'lightness' indicates that the simplified assignment of colors within the spectrum can be misleading. Excluding color-contrast illusions in dim light, there are no green, indigo, or violet stars. [[Red dwarf]]s are a deep shade of orange, and [[brown dwarf]]s do not literally appear brown, but hypothetically would appear dim grey to a nearby observer.

==Modern classification{{anchor|MK}}==
[[File:Morgan-Keenan spectral classification.png|thumb|The Morgan–Keenan spectral classification]]

The modern classification system is known as the ''Morgan–Keenan'' (MK) classification. Each star is assigned a spectral class from the older Harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using Roman numerals as explained below, forming the star's spectral type.

Other modern [[photometric system|stellar classification systems]], such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]], are based on [[color index]]es—the measured differences in three or more [[Magnitude (astronomy)|color magnitude]]s. Those numbers are given labels such as "U-V" or "B-V", which represent the colors passed by two standard filters (e.g. ''U''ltraviolet, ''B''lue and ''V''isual).

===Harvard spectral classification===
The ''Harvard system'' is a one-dimensional classification scheme by astronomer [[Annie Jump Cannon]], who re-ordered and simplified a prior alphabetical system. Stars are grouped according to their spectral characteristics by single letters of the alphabet, optionally with numeric subdivisions. Main-sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2,000 to 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], whereas more-evolved stars can have temperatures above 100,000&amp;nbsp;K. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest.

The spectral classes O through M, as well as other more specialized classes discussed later, are subdivided by [[Arabic numerals]] (0–9), where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class. For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in class&amp;nbsp;A and A9 denotes the coolest ones. Fractional numbers are allowed; for example, the star [[Mu Normae]] is classified as O9.7.&lt;ref name="UpsOriType"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS). II.

Conventional color descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an A&amp;nbsp;class star, which is considered to be white. The apparent color&lt;ref name="möre"/&gt; descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.

The fact that the Harvard classification of a star indicated its surface or [[Photosphere|photospheric]] [[temperature]] (or more precisely, its [[effective temperature]]) was not fully understood until after its development, though by the time the first [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] was formulated (by 1914), this was generally suspected to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Relations Between the Spectra and Other Characteristics of the Stars |magazine=Popular Astronomy |last=Russell |first=Henry Norris |volume=22 |pages=275–294 |date=March 1914 |bibcode=1914PA.....22..275R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]] derived a theory of ionization by extending well-known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms. First he applied it to the solar chromosphere, then to stellar spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On a Physical Theory of Stellar Spectra |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A |last=Saha |first=M. N. |volume=99 |issue=697 |pages=135–153 |date=May 1921 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1921.0029 |bibcode=1921RSPSA..99..135S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard astronomer [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|Cecilia Payne]] then demonstrated that the ''O-B-A-F-G-K-M'' spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Stellar Atmospheres; a Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars |publisher=Radcliffe College |first=Cecilia Helena |last=Payne |type=Ph.D |date=1925 |bibcode=1925PhDT.........1P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence, the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype, such as B3 or A7, depends upon (largely subjective) estimates of the strengths of absorption features in stellar spectra. As a result, these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals.

Hydrogen lines are strongest for types A and B, and the overall spectrum peaks at shorter wavelengths for hotter stars.]]

The ''Yerkes spectral classification'', also called the ''MKK'' system from the authors' initials, is a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by [[William Wilson Morgan]], [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip C. Keenan]], and [[Edith Kellman]] from [[Yerkes Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |first3=Edith |last3=Kellman |date=1943 |bibcode=1943assw.book.....M |oclc=1806249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-dimensional ([[temperature]] and [[luminosity]]) classification scheme is based on [[spectral line]]s sensitive to stellar temperature and [[surface gravity]], which is related to luminosity (whilst the ''Harvard classification'' is based on just surface temperature). Later, in 1953, after some revisions of list of standard stars and classification criteria, the scheme was named the ''Morgan–Keenan classification'', or ''MK'',&lt;ref name="ref_MK"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spectral Classification |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |volume=11 |pages=29–50 |date=1973 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.11.090173.000333 |bibcode=1973ARA&amp;A..11...29M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this system remains in use.

Denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit greater [[pressure broadening]] of spectral lines. The gravity, and hence the pressure, on the surface of a [[giant star]] is much lower than for a [[dwarf star]] because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as ''luminosity effects'' and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.

A number of different ''luminosity classes'' are distinguished, as listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="CDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/note.html |title=A note on the spectral atlas and spectral classification |publisher=[[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginal cases are allowed; for example, a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant, or may be in between the subgiant and main-sequence classifications. 
In these cases, two special symbols are used:
*A slash ('''/''') means that a star is either one class or the other.
*A dash ('''-''') means that the star is in between the two classes.

For example, a star classified as A3-4III/IV would be in between spectral types A3 and A4, while being either a giant star or a subgiant.

Sub-dwarf classes have also been used: VI for sub-dwarfs (stars slightly less luminous than the main sequence).

Nominal luminosity class&amp;nbsp;VII (and sometimes higher numerals) is now rarely used for white dwarf or "hot sub-dwarf" classes, since the temperature-letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs.

Occasionally, letters ''a'' and ''b'' are applied to luminosity classes other than supergiants; for example, a giant star slightly more luminous than typical may be given a luminosity class of IIIb.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=An Encoding System to Represent Stellar Spectral Classes in Archival Databases and Catalogs |eprint=1112.3617 |last1=Smith |first1=Myron A. |last2=Thompson |first2=Randall W. |last3=Gray |first3=Richard O. |last4=Corbally |first4=Christopher |last5=Kamp |first5=Inga |display-authors=1 |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The reason for the odd arrangement of letters in the Harvard classification is historical, having evolved from the earlier Secchi classes and been progressively modified as understanding improved.

===Secchi classes===
During the 1860s and 1870s, pioneering stellar spectroscopist [[Angelo Secchi]] created the ''Secchi classes'' in order to classify observed spectra. By 1866, he had developed three classes of stellar spectra, shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30204/f364.table Analyse spectrale de la lumière de quelques étoiles, et nouvelles observations sur les taches solaires], P. Secchi, ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences'' '''63''' (July–December 1866), pp. 364–368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30204/f623.table Nouvelles recherches sur l'analyse spectrale de la lumière des étoiles], P. Secchi, ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences'' '''63''' (July–December 1866), pp. 621–628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hearnshaw |first=J.

In the late 1890s, this classification began to be superseded by the Harvard classification, which is discussed in the remainder of this article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~gott/AST1002/Additional_Notes/Add_notes.week5 Classification of Stellar Spectra: Some History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaler |first=James B. |date=1997 |title=Stars and Their Spectra: An Introduction to the Spectral Sequence |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=62–63 |isbn=0-521-58570-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 60–63, Hearnshaw 1986; pp. 623–625, Secchi 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, the astronomer [[Edward C. Pickering]] began to make a survey of stellar spectra at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], using the objective-prism method. A first result of this work was the ''Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra'', published in 1890. [[Williamina Fleming]] classified most of the spectra in this catalogue.

The catalogue used a scheme in which the previously used Secchi classes (I to IV) were subdivided into more specific classes, given letters from A to N. Also, the letters O, P, and Q were used &amp;ndash; O for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines, P for planetary nebulae, and Q for stars not fitting into any other class.&lt;ref name="drapera"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1890AnHar..27....1P |title=The Draper Catalogue of stellar spectra photographed with the 8-inch Bache telescope as a part of the Henry Draper memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=27 |pages=1 |author1=Pickering |first1=Edward C. |year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="draperb"&gt;pp. 106–108, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard system===
In 1897, another worker at Harvard, [[Antonia Maury]], placed the Orion subtype of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I ahead of the remainder of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I, thus placing the modern type&amp;nbsp;B ahead of the modern type&amp;nbsp;A. She was the first to do so, although she did not use lettered spectral types, but rather a series of twenty-two types numbered from I to XXII.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 111–112, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1897AnHar..28....1M |title=Spectra of bright stars photographed with the 11&amp;nbsp;inch Draper Telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=1 |author1=Maury |first1=Antonia C. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] returned to the lettered types, but dropped all letters except O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, used in that order, as well as P for planetary nebulae and Q for some peculiar spectra. She also used types such as B5A for stars halfway between types B and A, F2G for stars one-fifth of the way from F to G, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1901AnHar..28..129C |title=Spectra of bright southern stars photographed with the 13&amp;nbsp;inch Boyden telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=129 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie J. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;117–119, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by 1912, Cannon had changed the types B, A, B5A, F2G, etc. to B0, A0, B5, F2, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1912AnHar..56..115C |title=Classification of 1,688 southern stars by means of their spectra |journal=Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College |volume=56 |pages=115 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie Jump |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward Charles |year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 121–122, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially the modern form of the Harvard classification system.

A common [[mnemonic]] for remembering the order of the spectral type letters, from hottest to coolest, is "Oh, Be A Fine Guy/Girl, Kiss Me".

==Spectral types==
The stellar classification system is [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], based on [[Type (biology)|type specimens]], similar to classification of species in [[biology]]: The categories are defined by one or more standard stars for each category and sub-category, with an associated description of the distinguishing features.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;

==="Early" and "late" nomenclature===
Stars are often referred to as ''early'' or ''late'' types. "Early" is a synonym for ''hotter'', while "late" is a synonym for ''cooler''.

Depending on the context, "early" and "late" may be absolute or relative terms. "Early" as an absolute term would therefore refer to O or B, and possibly A stars. As a relative reference it relates to stars hotter than others, such as "early K" being perhaps K0, K1, and K3.

"Late" is used in the same way, with an unqualified use of the term indicating stars with spectral types such as K and M, but it can also be used for stars that are cool relative to other stars, as in using "late G" to refer to G7, G8, and G9.

In the relative sense, "early" means a lower Arabic numeral following the class letter, and "late" means a higher number.

This obscure terminology is a hold-over from an early 20th&amp;nbsp;century model of stellar evolution, which supposed that stars were powered by gravitational contraction via the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]], which is now known to not apply to [[main sequence]] stars. If that were true, then stars would start their lives as very hot "early-type" stars and then gradually cool down into "late-type" stars. This mechanism provided ages of the [[Sun]] that were much smaller than what is observed in the [[geologic record]], and was rendered obsolete by the discovery that stars are powered by [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/latetype.html |title=late-type star |first=David |last=Darling |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "early" and "late" were carried over, beyond the demise of the model they were based on.

===Class O===
{{Main|O-type star}}
{{See also|O-type main-sequence star|Blue giant|Blue supergiant}}
[[File:Zeta Puppis.png|thumb|Artist's rendering of [[Zeta Puppis]], an O4 supergiant]]

O-type stars are very hot and extremely luminous, with most of their radiated output in the [[ultraviolet]] range. These are the rarest of all main-sequence stars. About 1 in 3,000,000 (0.00003%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are O-type stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"&gt;These proportions are fractions of stars brighter than absolute magnitude&amp;nbsp;16; lowering this limit will render earlier types even rarer, whereas generally adding only to the M class.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |last=Ledrew |first=Glenn |volume=95 |page=32 |date=February 2001 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[List of most massive stars|most massive stars]] lie within this spectral class. O-type stars frequently have complicated surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult.

O-type spectra formerly were defined by the ratio of the strength of the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471, where λ is the [[wavelength]], measured in [[ångström]]s. Spectral type O7 was defined to be the point at which the two intensities are equal, with the He&amp;nbsp;I line weakening towards earlier types. Type&amp;nbsp;O3 was, by definition, the point at which said line disappears altogether, although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology. Due to this, the modern definition uses the ratio of the [[nitrogen]] line N&amp;nbsp;IV λ4058 to N&amp;nbsp;III λλ4634-40-42.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

O-type stars have dominant lines of absorption and sometimes emission for [[helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II lines, prominent ionized ([[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;IV, [[oxygen|O]]&amp;nbsp;III, [[nitrogen|N]]&amp;nbsp;III, and [[carbon|C]]&amp;nbsp;III) and neutral [[helium]] lines, strengthening from O5 to O9, and prominent hydrogen [[Balmer lines]], although not as strong as in later types. Because they are so massive, O-type stars have very hot cores and burn through their hydrogen fuel very quickly, so they are the first stars to leave the [[main sequence]].

When the MKK classification scheme was first described in 1943, the only subtypes of class&amp;nbsp;O used were O5 to O9.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ASS_Atlas/frames.html ''An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification''], W.

[[File:Eta CMa.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of [[Eta Canis Majoris|Aludra]], a B5 [[supergiant]] seen in [[Canis Major]].]]

B-type stars are very luminous and blue. Their spectra have neutral helium lines, which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen lines. As [[OB star|O- and B-type stars]] are so energetic, they only live for a relatively short time. Thus, due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime, they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed, apart from [[runaway star]]s.

The transition from class&amp;nbsp;O to class&amp;nbsp;B was originally defined to be the point at which the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 disappears. However, with modern equipment, the line is still apparent in the early B-type stars. Today for main-sequence stars, the B-class is instead defined by the intensity of the He&amp;nbsp;I violet spectrum, with the maximum intensity corresponding to class&amp;nbsp;B2. For supergiants, lines of [[silicon]] are used instead; the Si&amp;nbsp;IV λ4089 and Si&amp;nbsp;III λ4552 lines are indicative of early B. At mid B, the intensity of the latter relative to that of Si&amp;nbsp;II λλ4128-30 is the defining characteristic, while for late B, it is the intensity of Mg&amp;nbsp;II λ4481 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

These stars tend to be found in their originating [[OB association]]s, which are associated with giant [[molecular cloud]]s. The Orion OB1 association occupies a large portion of a [[spiral arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] and contains many of the brighter stars of the [[Orion constellation|constellation Orion]]. About 1 in 800 (0.125%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are [[B-type main-sequence star]]s.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt;

Massive yet non-[[supergiant]] entities known as "Be&amp;nbsp;stars" are main-sequence stars that notably have, or had at some time, one or more [[Balmer lines]] in emission, with the [[hydrogen]]-related [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[Hydrogen spectral series|series]] projected out by the stars being of particular interest. Be stars are generally thought to feature unusually strong [[stellar wind]]s, high surface temperatures, and significant attrition of [[stellar mass]] as the objects [[Stellar rotation|rotate]] at a curiously rapid rate.&lt;ref name="Slettebak1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Be Stars |journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |first=Arne |last=Slettebak |volume=100 |pages=770–784 |date=July 1988 |doi=10.1086/132234 |bibcode=1988PASP..100..770S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects known as [[B(e) star|"B(e)" or "B[e]" stars]] possess distinctive neutral or low ionisation [[emission lines]] that are considered to have '[[forbidden mechanism]]s', undergoing processes not normally allowed under current understandings of [[quantum mechanics]].

A-type stars are among the more common naked eye stars, and are white or bluish-white. They have strong hydrogen lines, at a maximum by A0, and also lines of ionized metals ([[iron|Fe]]&amp;nbsp;II, [[magnesium|Mg]]&amp;nbsp;II, [[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;II) at a maximum at A5. The presence of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II lines is notably strengthening by this point.

[[File:Sun white.jpg|thumb|The [[Sun]], a G2 main-sequence star, with dark sunspots]]

G-type stars, including the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name="SunSpectrum"/&gt; have prominent spectral lines ''H'' and ''K'' of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II, which are most pronounced at G2. They have even weaker hydrogen lines than F, but along with the ionized metals, they have neutral metals. There is a prominent spike in the G band of [[cyanide|CH]] molecules. Class&amp;nbsp;G main-sequence stars make up about 7.5%, nearly one in thirteen, of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt;

G is host to the "Yellow Evolutionary Void".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=''Checking the yellow evolutionary void.

[[File:Arcturus (optical).png|thumb|[[Arcturus]], a K1.5 giant]]

K-type stars are orangish stars that are slightly cooler than the Sun. They make up about 12% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; There are also giant K-type stars, which range from [[hypergiant]]s like [[RW Cephei]], to [[Giant star|giants]] and [[supergiant]]s, such as [[Arcturus]], whereas [[K-type main-sequence star|orange dwarfs]], like [[Alpha Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;B, are main-sequence stars.

They have extremely weak hydrogen lines, if they are present at all, and mostly neutral metals ([[manganese|Mn]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[iron|Fe]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;I). By late K, molecular bands of [[titanium monoxide|titanium oxide]] become present. There is a suggestion that K-spectrum stars may potentially increase the chances of life developing on orbiting planets that are within the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacefellowship.com/2009/08/10/on-a-cosmological-timescale-the-earths-period-of-habitability-is-nearly-over/ |title=On a cosmological timescale, The Earth's period of habitability is nearly over &amp;#124; International Space Fellowship |publisher=Spacefellowship.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class M===
{{See also|Red dwarf|Red giant|Red supergiant}}
[[File:UY Scuti zoomed in, Rutherford Observatory, 07 September 2014.jpeg|thumb|[[UY Scuti]], an M4 supergiant]]

Class&amp;nbsp;M stars are by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are class&amp;nbsp;M stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This rises to 78.6% if we include all stars. (See the above note.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; However, class&amp;nbsp;M main-sequence stars ([[red dwarf]]s) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions. The brightest known M-class main-sequence star is M0V [[Lacaille 8760]], with [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]] 6.6 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5), and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found.

Although most class&amp;nbsp;M stars are red dwarfs, most of the largest ever supergiant stars in the Milky Way are M stars. such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], [[Antares]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are also class&amp;nbsp;M. Furthermore, the larger, hotter [[brown dwarf]]s are late class&amp;nbsp;M, usually in the range of M6.5 to M9.5.

The spectrum of a class&amp;nbsp;M star contains lines from [[oxide]] [[molecule]]s (in the [[visible spectrum]], especially [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]) and all neutral metals, but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent. TiO bands can be strong in class&amp;nbsp;M stars, usually dominating their visible spectrum by about M5. [[Vanadium(II) oxide]] bands become present by late M.

Spectra of some very hot and bluish stars exhibit marked emission lines from carbon or nitrogen, or sometimes oxygen.

====Class W: Wolf–Rayet====
{{Main|Wolf–Rayet star}}
[[File:M1-67 &amp; WR124.png|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image of the nebula M1-67 and the Wolf–Rayet star [[WR 124]] in the center]]

Class&amp;nbsp;W or WR represents the [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, notable for spectra lacking hydrogen lines. Instead their spectra are dominated by broad emission lines of highly ionized helium, nitrogen, carbon and sometimes oxygen. They are thought to mostly be dying supergiants with their hydrogen layers blown away by [[stellar wind]]s, thereby directly exposing their hot helium shells. Class&amp;nbsp;W is further divided into subclasses according to the relative strength of nitrogen and carbon emission lines in their spectra (and outer layers).&lt;ref name=WR&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007ARA&amp;A..45..177C |title=Physical Properties of Wolf-Rayet Stars |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=45 |pages=177–219 |author1=Crowther |first1=Paul A. |year=2007 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.45.051806.110615 |arxiv=astro-ph/0610356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these show [WC] spectra, some [WO], and very rarely [WN].

====The "Slash" stars====
{{Main|Slash star}}
The ''slash'' stars are O-type stars with WN-like lines in their spectra. The name "slash" comes from their printed spectral type having a slash in it (e.g. "Of/WNL"&lt;ref name="Walborn"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008RMxAC..33....5W |title=Multiwavelength Systematics of OB Spectra |journal=Massive Stars: Fundamental Parameters and Circumstellar Interactions (Eds. P. Benaglia |volume=33 |pages=5 |author1=Walborn |first1=N. R. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There is a secondary group found with this spectra, a cooler, "intermediate" group designated "Ofpe/WN9".&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt; These stars have also been referred to as WN10 or WN11, but that has become less popular with the realisation of the evolutionary difference from other Wolf–Rayet stars. Recent discoveries of even rarer stars have extended the range of slash stars as far as O2-3.5If&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/WN5-7, which are even hotter than the original "slash" stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crowther |first1=P.

===Cool red and brown dwarf classes===
{{main|Brown dwarf|Red dwarf}}
The new spectral types L, T, and Y were created to classify infrared spectra of cool stars. This includes both [[red dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s that are very faint in the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008ASPC..384...85K |arxiv=0704.1522 |title=Outstanding Issues in Our Understanding of L, T, and Y Dwarfs |journal=14th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars |volume=384 |pages=85 |author1=Kirkpatrick |first1=J. D. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brown dwarf]]s, whose energy comes from [[gravitational]] attraction alone, cool as they age and so progress to later spectral types. Brown dwarfs start their lives with M-type spectra and will cool through the L, T, and Y spectral classes, faster the less massive they are; the highest-mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to Y or even T dwarfs within the age of the universe. Because this leads to an unresolvable overlap between spectral types{{'}} [[effective temperature]] and [[luminosity]] for some masses and ages of different L-T-Y types, no distinct [[effective temperature|temperature]] or [[luminosity]] values can be given.&lt;ref name=bdevol&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary models for cool brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.

====Class L====
[[File:L-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of an L-dwarf]]

Class L dwarfs get their designation because they are cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support [[hydrogen fusion]] and are therefore stars, but most are of [[substellar object|substellar]] mass and are therefore brown dwarfs. They are a very dark red in color and brightest in [[infrared]]. Their [[atmosphere]] is cool enough to allow [[metal hydride]]s and [[alkali metal]]s to be prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.

Due to low surface gravity in giant stars, [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]- and [[Vanadium monoxide|VO]]-bearing condensates never form. Thus, L-type stars larger than dwarfs can never form in an isolated environment. However, it may be possible for these L-type supergiants to form through stellar collisions, an example of which is [[V838 Monocerotis]] while in the height of its [[luminous red nova]] eruption.

====Class T: methane dwarfs{{anchor|Class T}}====
[[File:T-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of a T-dwarf]]

Class&amp;nbsp;T dwarfs are cool [[brown dwarf]]s with surface temperatures between approximately {{convert|550|and|1300|K|C F}}. Their emission peaks in the [[infrared]]. [[Methane]] is prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kirk_ApJ"/&gt;

Classes&amp;nbsp;T and L could be more common than all the other classes combined if recent research is accurate. Because brown dwarfs persist for so long—a few times the age of the universe—in the absence of catastrophic collisions these smaller bodies can only increase in number.

Study of the number of [[protoplanetary disk|proplyds]] (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in [[nebula]]e from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the [[galaxy]] should be several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] higher than what was previously conjectured. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a [[protostar]], which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us.

Brown dwarfs of spectral class&amp;nbsp;Y are cooler than those of spectral class&amp;nbsp;T and have qualitatively different spectra from them.

The latest brown dwarf proposed for the Y spectral type, [[WISE 1828+2650]], is a &gt;&amp;nbsp;Y2&amp;nbsp;dwarf with an effective temperature originally estimated around 300&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], the temperature of the human body.&lt;ref name="stars-cooler-than-body"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cool-y-dwarf"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eso1110&gt;[[European Southern Observatory]]. [http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1110/ "A Very Cool Pair of Brown Dwarfs"], 23 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parallax]] measurements have, however, since shown that its luminosity is inconsistent with it being colder than ~400&amp;nbsp;K. The coolest Y dwarf currently known is [[WISE 0855−0714]] with an approximate temperature of 250&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name="Luhman2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Spectral Energy Distribution of the Coldest Known Brown Dwarf |arxiv=1605.06655 |first1=Kevin L. |last1=Luhman |first2=Taran L. |last2=Esplin |date=May 2016 |doi=10.3847/0004-6256/152/3/78 |volume=152 |issue=3 |journal=The Astronomical Journal |page=78 |bibcode=2016AJ....152...78L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass range for Y&amp;nbsp;dwarfs is 9–25&amp;nbsp;[[Jupiter]] masses, but young objects might reach below one Jupiter mass, which means that Y class objects straddle the 13&amp;nbsp;Jupiter mass [[deuterium]]-fusion limit that marks the current [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] division between brown dwarfs and planets.&lt;ref name=ydwarfsurvey /&gt;

===Late giant carbon-star classes===
Carbon-stars are stars whose spectra indicate production of carbon—a byproduct of [[Triple-alpha process|triple-alpha]] helium fusion. With increased carbon abundance, and some parallel [[s-process]] heavy element production, the spectra of these stars become increasingly deviant from the usual late spectral classes&amp;nbsp;G, K, and M. Equivalent classes for carbon-rich stars are S and C.

The giants among those stars are presumed to produce this carbon themselves, but some stars in this class are double stars, whose odd atmosphere is suspected of having been transferred from a companion that is now a white dwarf, when the companion was a carbon-star.

====Class C: carbon stars====
{{Main|Carbon star}}
[[File:Curious spiral spotted by ALMA around red giant star R Sculptoris (data visualisation).jpg|thumb|Image of the carbon star [[R Sculptoris]] and its striking spiral structure]]

Originally classified as R and N stars, these are also known as ''carbon stars''. These are red giants, near the end of their lives, in which there is an excess of carbon in the atmosphere. The old R and N classes ran parallel to the normal classification system from roughly mid G to late M. These have more recently been remapped into a unified carbon classifier C with N0 starting at roughly C6. Another subset of cool carbon stars are the C-J&amp;nbsp;type stars, which are characterized by the strong presence of molecules of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]] in addition to those of [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouigue, R. (1954). Annales d'Astrophysique, Vol.&amp;nbsp;17, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; A few main-sequence carbon stars are known, but the overwhelming majority of known carbon stars are giants or supergiants. There are several subclasses:
* C-R &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class (''R'') representing the carbon star equivalent of late G to early K-type stars.
* C-N &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class representing the carbon star equivalent of late K to M-type stars.
* C-J &amp;ndash; A subtype of cool C stars with a high content of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]].
* C-H &amp;ndash; [[Population II]] analogues of the C-R stars.
* C-Hd &amp;ndash; Hydrogen-deficient carbon stars, similar to late G supergiants with [[Methylidyne radical|CH]] and [[diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands added.

====Class S====
{{Main|S-type star}}
Class&amp;nbsp;S stars form a continuum between class&amp;nbsp;M stars and carbon stars. Those most similar to class&amp;nbsp;M stars have strong [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] [[spectral bands|absorption bands]] analogous to the [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]] bands of class&amp;nbsp;M stars, whereas those most similar to carbon stars have strong [[Sodium|sodium D line]]s and weak [[Diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, P. C. (1954). ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol.&amp;nbsp;120, p.&amp;nbsp;484&lt;/ref&gt; Class&amp;nbsp;S stars have excess amounts of [[zirconium]] and other elements produced by the [[s-process]], and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than class&amp;nbsp;M or carbon stars. Like carbon stars, nearly all known class&amp;nbsp;S stars are [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] stars.

The spectral type is formed by the letter&amp;nbsp;S and a number between zero and ten. This number corresponds to the temperature of the star and approximately follows the temperature scale used for class&amp;nbsp;M giants. The most common types are S3 to S5. The non-standard designation S10 has only been used for the star [[Chi Cygni]] when at an extreme minimum.

The basic classification is usually followed by an abundance indication, following one of several schemes: S2,5; S2/5; S2 Zr4 Ti2; or S2*5. A number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] and [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]. A number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen on a scale of 1 to 10, where a 0 would be an MS star. Intensities of [[zirconium]] and [[titanium]] may be indicated explicitly. Also occasionally seen is a number following an asterisk, which represents the strength of the [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] bands on a scale from 1 to 5.

====Classes MS and SC: intermediary carbon-related classes====
In between the M and S classes, border cases are named MS stars. In a similar way, border cases between the S and C-N classes are named SC or CS. The sequence M → MS → S → SC → C-N is hypothesized to be a sequence of increased carbon abundance with age for [[carbon star]]s in the [[asymptotic giant branch]].

===White dwarf classifications{{anchor|Class D}}===
{{Main|White dwarf spectroscopy}}
[[File:Sirius A and B Hubble photo.jpg|thumb|[[Sirius]] A and B (a [[white dwarf]] of type DA2) resolved by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]]]]

The class&amp;nbsp;D (for [[Electron-degenerate matter|Degenerate]]) is the modern classification used for white dwarfs – low-mass stars that are no longer undergoing [[nuclear fusion]] and have shrunk to planetary size, slowly cooling down. Class&amp;nbsp;D is further divided into spectral types DA, DB, DC, DO, DQ, DX, and DZ. The letters are not related to the letters used in the classification of other stars, but instead indicate the composition of the white dwarf's visible outer layer or atmosphere.

The white dwarf types are as follows:&lt;ref name="sionspectra"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1983ApJ...269..253S |title=A proposed new white dwarf spectral classification system |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=269 |pages=253 |author1=Sion |first1=E.

A. |year=1983 |doi=10.1086/161036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20041372 |title=The rate of period change in pulsating DB-white dwarf stars |year=2004 |last1=Córsico |first1=A. H. |last2=Althaus |first2=L. G. |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=428 |pages=159–170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0408237 |bibcode=2004A&amp;A...428..159C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DA &amp;ndash; a [[hydrogen]]-rich atmosphere or outer layer, indicated by strong Balmer hydrogen [[spectral line]]s.
* DB &amp;ndash; a [[helium]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by neutral helium, [[spectroscopic notation|He&amp;nbsp;I]], spectral lines.
* DO &amp;ndash; a helium-rich atmosphere, indicated by ionized helium, [[spectroscopic notation|He&amp;nbsp;II]], spectral lines.
* DQ &amp;ndash; a [[carbon]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by atomic or molecular carbon lines.
* DZ &amp;ndash; a [[metal (astronomy)|metal]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by metal spectral lines (a merger of the obsolete white dwarf spectral types, DG, DK and DM).
* DC &amp;ndash; no strong spectral lines indicating one of the above categories.
* DX &amp;ndash; spectral lines are insufficiently clear to classify into one of the above categories.

The type is followed by a number giving the white dwarf's surface temperature. This number is a rounded form of 50400/''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s. Originally, this number was rounded to one of the digits 1 through 9, but more recently fractional values have started to be used, as well as values below 1 and above 9.&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="villanovar4"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1999ApJS..121....1M |title=A Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=121 |pages=1–130 |author1=McCook |first1=George P. |last2=Sion |first2=Edward M. |year=1999 |doi=10.1086/313186 |citeseerx=10.1.1.565.5507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two or more of the type letters may be used to indicate a white dwarf that displays more than one of the spectral features above.&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;

'''Extended white dwarf spectral types:'''&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;
* DAB &amp;ndash; a hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarf displaying neutral helium lines.
* DAO &amp;ndash; a hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarf displaying ionized helium lines.
* DAZ &amp;ndash; a hydrogen-rich metallic white dwarf.
* DBZ &amp;ndash; a helium-rich metallic white dwarf.

A different set of spectral peculiarity symbols are used for white dwarfs than for other types of stars:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code
! Spectral peculiarities for stars
|-
! P
| Magnetic white dwarf with detectable polarization
|-
! E
| Emission lines present
|-
! H
| Magnetic white dwarf without detectable polarization
|-
! V
| Variable
|-
! PEC
| Spectral peculiarities exist
|}

==Stellar remnants==
{{Main|Neutron star|Black hole|Exotic star}}
Stellar remnants are objects associated with the death of stars. Included in the category are white dwarfs, and as can be seen from the radically different classification scheme for class&amp;nbsp;D, non-stellar objects are difficult to fit into the MK system.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which the MK system is based on, is observational in nature so these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram, or cannot be placed at all. Old [[neutron star]]s are relatively small and cold, and would fall on the far right side of the diagram. [[Planetary nebula]]e are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the [[white dwarf]] branch. If shown, a planetary nebula would be plotted to the right of the diagram's upper right quadrant. A [[black hole]] emits no visible light of its own, and therefore would not appear on the diagram.&lt;ref name="chan-var-hr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/variable_stars/bg_info.html |title=Pulsating Variable Stars and the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replaced spectral classes==
Several spectral types, all previously used for non-standard stars in the mid-20th century, have been replaced during revisions of the stellar classification system. They may still be found in old editions of star catalogs: R and N have been subsumed into the new C class as C-R and C-N.

'''The Flying Grass Carpet''' is a huge rug entirely made of [[artificial grass]]. It travels around the world, as a temporary landscape. It's intended as space to play on and enjoy, but can also be used for picnics, open-air festivals and sports .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying carpet, or pop-up pasture?|url=http://springwise.com/lifestyle_leisure/flying_carpet_or_pop-up_pastur/?format=print|work=Lifestyle &amp; Leisure|publisher=www.springwise.com|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The designers of The Flying Grass Carpet live in [[Rotterdam]], a city known for its designers and [[architects]]. The designers of the Flying Grass Carpet are fond of cities and city-life but are concerned about the loss of quality of the public space in a lot of cities. To make a positive gesture they created The Flying Grass Carpet.

The Flying Grass Carpet travels to different places around the world, and stays in the different locations for a short period of time.  It's intended to function as an actual park, allowing people to enjoy all the activities they can normally only enjoy in the park, in the middle of the city. The Flying Grass Carpet is also intended to connect different cities and their citizens with each other, and create what its designers call a "worldwide shared public domain".  [[Image:Tfgctech.jpg|thumb|alt=A''[[Technical Details]]''.]]

==Technical details==
The carpet contains several types and colors of grass. It weighs 6375 kilograms (6.5&amp;nbsp;kg per square meter). The size of the carpet is adjustable, and can be up to 25 by 36 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyinggrasscarpet.org/tech.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
The Flying Grass Carpet won a '[[Dutch Design Award]]' in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch design awards|url=http://www.dutchdesignawards.nl/nl/hall_of_fame/2009/&amp;id=589|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international relations '''violent non-state actors''' ('''VNSA''') (also known as '''non-state armed actors''' or '''non-state armed groups''') are individuals and groups that are wholly or partly independent of [[state government]]s and which threaten or use violence to achieve their goals.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}

VNSAs vary widely in their goals, size, and methods. They may include [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics cartels]], popular [[liberation movements]], religious and ideological organizations, [[corporations]] (e.g. [[Private military company|private military contractors]]), self-defence [[militia]], and [[Paramilitary|paramilitary groups]] established by state governments to further their interests.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}{{Sfn|Chatham House|2016|p=8}}

While some VNSAs oppose governments, others are allied to them.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}} Some VNSAs are organized as paramilitary groups, adopting methods and structure similar to those of state [[Military|armed forces]]. Others may be informally structured and use violence in other ways, such as kidnapping, using [[improvised explosive device]]s, or [[Security hacker|hacking]] into computer systems.

==Description==
{{See also|Non-state actor}}

[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_Graffiti.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MS-13]] gang graffiti.]]

Thomas, Kiser, and Casebeer asserted in 2005 that "VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community".{{sfn|Thomas|Kiser|Casebeer|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} As a new type of actor in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional [[Westphalian sovereignty]] system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance; and by challenging the state's [[monopoly of violence]].

Phil Williams stated in 2008 that in the 21st century, they "have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep4"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to the further undermining of governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are "unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations", "individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; This causes the family, tribe, clan or other group to become "the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; According to Williams, globalization has "not only... challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. Globalization helps VNSAs develop transnational social capital and alliances as well as funding opportunities.&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6—7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in several papers published by the [[US military]].{{sfn|Casebeer|Thomas|2002}}{{sfn|Bartolomei|Casebeer|Thomas|2004}}{{sfn|Thomas|Casebeer|2004}}{{sfn|Shultz|Farah|Lochard|2004|}}

== Types ==
Some common and influential types of VNSAs include:
* Criminal organizations. [[Drug cartel]]s, for example, may carry out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions; operate protection rackets; and [[wikt:turf war|defend their ''turf'']] from rival groups and the military.
* [[Social movement|People's movements]] or sections of them that have chosen [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] (also known as [[asymmetric warfare]]) to pursue their aims. An example is the [[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency|Naxalite-Maoist insurgency]] in central India.{{Sfn|Economist|2006|p=}}
* [[Private military company|Private military companies]], and corporations that either have their own, or hire, private military services.{{Sfn|Daugaard|2012|p=}} An example is [[Floating armoury|floating armouries]] in the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Holtom and Chapsos|2015|p=}}
* Religious or ideological groups, such as [[Boko Haram]] in and around Nigeria, that espouse armed violence as a moral or sacred duty.{{Sfn|Drake|1998|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=30-31}}
* Citizen militia, which may form to protect a locality from (or threaten it with) attack, such as the [[Anti-balaka|anti-balaka movement]] in the Central African Republic.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016b|p=4}}
* [[Paramilitary]] groups, which make use of military methods and structures to pursue their agenda, such as the now-decommissioned Irish Republican Army.
* [[Warlord]]s, who are leaders using armed violence to exercise military, economic, and political control over territory within a sovereign state. Warlords have a long history in Afghanistan, for example.{{Sfn|Coll|2004|p=4}}
Phil Williams, in an overview article, identifies five types of VNSAs:&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep9-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=9—16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Warlord]]s
* [[Militia]]s
* [[Insurgency|Insurgencies]]
* [[List of designated terrorist organizations|Terrorist organizations]]
* [[Criminal organization]]s and gangs

== Relationship to terrorism ==
There is no commonly accepted [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of "terrorism"]],{{Sfn|Emmerson|2016|p=10-11}}{{Sfn|Halibozek et al|2008|p=4-5}}{{Sfn|Williamson|2009|p=38}} and the term is frequently used as a political tactic to denounce opponents whose status as [[Terrorism|terrorists]] is disputed.{{Sfn|Sinclair and Antonius|2012|p=14}} An attempt at a global definition appears in the working draft of Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism, which defines terrorism as a type of act, rather than as a type of group.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}} Specifically, "terrorism" in the draft refers to the threatened or actual intentional injury to others, and serious damage to property resulting in major economic loss:{{quote|when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}}}}

Since the definition encompasses the actions of some violent non-state actors (and of some state actors) and not others, disagreements remain and the treaty has yet to be agreed, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}} For example, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] has called for acts of terrorism to be distinguished from:{{quote|the legitimate struggle of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination in the exercise of their right to [[self-determination]] in accordance with the principles of [[international law]]".{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}}}}

== Use of children ==

{{See also|Children in the military|Child soldiers in Africa|Impact of war on children}}

Violent non-state actors have drawn international condemnation for relying heavily on children under the age of 18 as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}} (although many state armed forces also recruit children).{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2012|p=}} In 2017, for example, the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, [[Child soldiers in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, The Philippines, [[Child soldiers in Somalia|Somalia]], South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Not all armed groups use children, and approximately 60 that used to do so have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=4}} For example, by 2017 the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the [[Philippines]] had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks,{{Sfn|UNICEF|2017|p=}} and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC-EP]] guerilla movement in Colombia agreed in 2016 to stop recruiting children.{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=41}} In other situations, the use of children was increasing in 2017, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them intensified efforts to recruit children.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}}

==Humanitarian engagement==

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] propose that engagement with VNSAs, which they call armed non-state actors, is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts. They claim that it is often necessary to do so to facilitate access to those affected and to provide humanitarian assistance.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}} However, humanitarian agencies often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly because of the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs in counterterrorism legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion, further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}}

The International Security Department and the International Law Programme at Chatham House are seeking to understand the dynamics that will determine support for a principle-based approach to engagement by humanitarian actors with VNSAs.{{sfn|''Chatham House''}}

[[File:Full of fresh vitality (2864879525).jpg|thumb|right|Vitality means Life]]
'''Vitality''' is [[life]], life force, [[health]], [[youth]], or ability to live or exist. The word vitality is derived from the Latin word ''vita'', which means "life."

== Jainism ==
According to [[Jain philosophy]], there are ten vitalities or life-principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pujyapada (Shri.)|editor=S. A. Jain|title=Reality|date=1960|publisher=Vira Sasana Sangha|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uRIaAAAAMAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT|archive-date=2015|quote=Not in Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;-
*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind

The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.{{sfn|Jain|2012|pp=34–35}}

A '''world view'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/world-view|title=world-view noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''worldview''' is the fundamental [[cognitive]] orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual's or society's knowledge and [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[calque]] of the German word '''''[[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]''''' {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʔanˌʃaʊ.ʊŋ||De-Weltanschauung.ogg}}, composed of ''[[wikt:Welt|Welt]]'' ('world') and ''[[wikt:Anschauung|Anschauung]]'' ('view' or 'outlook').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=worldview |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word is also used in English.

It is a concept fundamental to [[German philosophy]] and [[epistemology]] and refers to a ''wide world perception''. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

Worldview remains a confused and confusing concept in English, used very differently by [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]]. It is for this reason that James W. Underhill suggests five subcategories: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective&lt;ref name =Underhill_2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Humboldt, Worldview and Language|date=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748638420|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Creating worldviews : metaphor, ideology and language|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748679096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107532847}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to  articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "[[figure and ground (media)|ground]]" in [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[Media (communication)|media analysis]]. However, core worldview beliefs are often deeply rooted, and so are only rarely reflected on by individuals, and are brought to the surface only in moments of crises of faith.

==Origins==

===Linguistics===
The [[Prussia]]n [[philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) originated the idea that language and worldview are inextricable. Humboldt saw language as part of the creative adventure of mankind. Culture, language and linguistic communities developed simultaneously and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to [[linguistic determinism]], which invites us to consider language as a constraint, a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1884–1939) also gives an account of the relationship between thinking and speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fadul |first= Jose |date= 2014 |title= Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling |url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WRrzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Edward+Sapir+also+gives+an+account+of+the+relationship+between+thinking+and+speaking+in+English&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ObjouuV9rd&amp;sig=RdD1S6ILO_XYWERUl0fB48KL5xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwictcjAoJTRAhVIpI8KHbCdDk4Q6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Sapir%20also%20gives%20an%20account%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20thinking%20and%20speaking%20in%20English&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= 347 |isbn= 978-1-312-34920-9 |author-link= | quote = Edward Sapir also gives an account of the significant relationship between thinking and speaking in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistic relativity]] [[hypothesis]] of [[Benjamin Whorf|Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1897–1941) describes how the syntactic-semantic structure of a language becomes an underlying structure for the world view or ''Weltanschauung'' of a people through the organization of the causal [[perception]] of the world and the linguistic [[categorization]] of entities. As linguistic categorization emerges as a representation of worldview and causality, it further modifies social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between [[language]] and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 679389 |pages= 65–79 |last1= Kay |first1= P. |last2= Kempton |first2= W. |title= What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis? |volume= 86 |issue= 1 |journal= American Anthropologist |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's hypothesis became influential in the late 1940s, but declined in prominence after a decade. In the 1990s, new research gave further support for the linguistic relativity theory in the works of [[Stephen Levinson]] (1947–) and his team at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck institute]] for [[psycholinguistics]] at [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory has also gained attention through the work of [[Lera Boroditsky]] at Stanford University.

===''Weltanschauung'' and cognitive philosophy===

One of the most important concepts in cognitive [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive sciences]] is the German concept of ''Weltanschauung''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This expression has often been used to refer to the "wide worldview" or "wide world perception" of a people, family, or person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The ''Weltanschauung'' of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}The [[language]] of a people reflects the ''Weltanschauung'' of that people in the form of its [[Syntax|syntactic structures]] and untranslatable [[connotation]]s and its [[denotation]]s.

The term ''Weltanschauung'' is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, as Jürgen Trabant points out, and as James W. Underhill reminds us, Humboldt's key concept was ''Weltansicht''.&lt;ref name=Underhill_2009/&gt; ''Weltansicht'' was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, ''Weltanschauung'', first used by Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

A worldview can be expressed as the "fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, Paul G. Transforming Worldviews: an anthropological understanding of how people change. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If it were possible to draw a [[map]] of the [[world]] on the basis of ''Weltanschauung'',&lt;ref name="Whorf" &gt;{{cite book|author-last=Whorf|author-first=Benjamin Lee|author-link=Benjamin Lee Whorf|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=John Bissell|editor-link=John Bissell Carroll|origyear=1st pub. 1956 |year=1964|title=Language, Thought, and Reality. Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;printsec=frontcover|location=Cambridge, Mass.|publisher=Technology Press of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;!--|ISBN=0-26273006-5 --&gt;|isbn=978-0-262-73006-8}} Pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22map+or+plan+of+an+actual+realm+of+ideas%22 25], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22stock+of+conceptions+common+to+people%22 36], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;q=%22environmental+conditions%22 29-30], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=%22language+family%22 242], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=music 248].&lt;/ref&gt; it would probably be seen to cross political borders—''Weltanschauung'' is the product of [[political]] borders and common experiences of a people from a [[geographical]] region,&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt; [[natural environment|environmental]]-[[climatic]] conditions, the economic resources available, socio-cultural [[system]]s, and the [[Language families and languages|language family]].&lt;ref name="Whorf"/&gt; (The work of the [[Population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] aims to show the gene-[[historical linguistics|linguistic]] co-[[evolution]] of people).

If the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is correct, the worldview map of the world would be similar to the linguistic map of the world. However, it would also almost coincide with a map of the world drawn on the basis of [[music]] across people.&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt;

===Folk-epics===
{{See also|List of world folk-epics}}

As natural language becomes manifestations of world [[perception]], the [[literature]] of a people with common ''Weltanschauung'' emerges as holistic [[representation (psychology)|representations]] of the wide world perception of the people. Thus the extent and commonality between world folk-epics becomes a manifestation of the commonality and extent of a worldview.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Epic poems]] are shared often by people across political borders and across generations. Examples of such epics include the [[Nibelungenlied]] of the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] people, the [[Iliad]] for the Ancient Greeks and Hellenized societies, the [[Silappadhikaram]] of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] of the Hindus, the [[Gilgamesh]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]n-[[Sumer]]ian [[civilization]] and the people of the [[Fertile Crescent]] at large, [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian nights) of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]] epic of the [[Mandé]] people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Terror management theory===
{{Main article|Terror management theory}}
A worldview, according to [[terror management theory]] (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety.&lt;ref name="worm"&gt;Schimel, J., Hayes, J., Williams, T., &amp; Jahrig, J. (2007). ''Is Death Really the Worm at the Core? Converging Evidence that Worldview Threat Increases Death-Thought Accessibility''. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 92, No. 5'', pp. 789-803.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that living up to the ideals of one's worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality, symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one's death, or in contributions to one's culture).&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Using a test of [[Terror management theory#Death thought accessibility|death-thought accessibility]] (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. "COFF__" could either be completed as either "COFFEE" or "COFFIN" or "COFFER"), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one's cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel ''et al'' conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Goldenberg ''et al'' found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., Cox, C. R., Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., &amp; Solomon, S. (2002). ''Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning.'' Journal of Sex Research, 39, 310–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The term World View denotes a comprehensive set of opinions, seen as an [[organic unity]], about the world as the medium and exercise of human existence. World View serves as a framework for generating various dimensions of human perception and experience like [[knowledge]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[culture]], [[science]] and [[ethics]]. For example, worldview of [[causality]] as ''uni-directional'', ''cyclic'', or ''spiral'' generates a framework of the world that reflects these systems of causality.

===Causality===
An unidirectional view of [[causality]] is present in some monotheistic views of the world with a beginning and an end and a single great force with a single end (e.g., [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), while a cyclic worldview of causality is present in religious traditions which are cyclic and seasonal and wherein events and experiences recur in systematic patterns (e.g., [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Hinduism]]). These worldviews of causality not only underlie religious traditions but also other aspects of thought like the purpose of [[history]], [[politics|political]] and [[economics|economic]] theories, and systems like [[democracy]], [[authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

The worldview of a [[linear]] and [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] causality generates various related/conflicting disciplines and approaches in [[scientific thinking]]. The ''Weltanschauung'' of the temporal contiguity of act and event leads to underlying diversifications like ''determinism'' vs. ''free will''. A worldview of [[free will]] leads to disciplines that are governed by simple laws that remain constant and are static and [[empirical]] in scientific method, while a worldview of [[determinism]] generates disciplines that are governed with [[dynamical systems|generative systems]] and [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] in [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] and [[materialism]] reject the validity of entities inaccessible to [[natural science]]. They view the [[scientific method]] as the most reliable model for [[model (abstract)|building]] an [[understanding]] of the [[world]].

==Religion==
[[Nishida Kitaro]] wrote extensively on "the Religious Worldview" in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed Kitaro's final book is ''Last Writings: Nothingness and the Religious Worldview''
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neo-Calvinist]] [[David Naugle]]'s ''World view: The History of a Concept'', "Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church."&lt;ref&gt;David K. Naugle ''Worldview: The History of a Concept'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4761-7}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian thinker [[James W. Sire]] defines a worldview as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." He suggests that "we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sire ''The Universe Next Door: A Basic World view Catalog'' p15–16 (text readable at Amazon.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person's view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the 'Emancipatory Worldview' in his writing "History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9631989/History_of_emancipatory_worldview_of_Muslim_learners|title=History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question mentioned above - on whether the super-smart machines, that is, any ''[[Superintelligence|superintelligences]]'', as expected by some, could have worldviews - is interesting in this context and this would influence human worldviews. 

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Belief system}}

The philosophical importance of worldviews became increasingly clear during the 20th century for a number of reasons, such as increasing contact between cultures, and the failure of some aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, such as the [[rationalist]] project of attaining all truth by reason alone. [[Mathematical logic]] showed that fundamental choices of [[axioms]] were essential in deductive reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Not just in the obvious sense that you need axioms to prove anything, but the fact that for example the [[Axiom of choice]] and [[Axiom S5]], although widely regarded as correct, were in some sense optional.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, even having chosen axioms not everything that was true in a given [[logical system]] could be proven.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]] and discussion in e.g. [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]'s ''The Freedom of the Will''&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe the problems extend to "the inconsistencies and failures which plagued the Enlightenment attempt to identify universal moral and rational principles";&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Alister McGrath]] in ''[[The Science of God]]'' p 109 citing in particular [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' – he also cites [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Enlightenment principles such as [[universal suffrage]] and the [[universal declaration of human rights]] are accepted, if not taken for granted, by many.&lt;ref&gt;"Governments in a democracy do not grant the fundamental freedoms enumerated by Jefferson; governments are created to protect those freedoms that every individual possesses by virtue of his or her existence. In their formulation by the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, inalienable rights are God-given natural rights. These rights are not destroyed when civil society is created, and neither society nor government can remove or "alienate" them."[http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm US Gov website on democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190718/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of relativity]] offers a Weltanschauung that is revolting to [[absolute space and time]], yet provides a context for modern theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]]. In a book review for a new undergraduate textbook on relativity by [[Wolfgang Rindler]], Kenneth Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobs (1970) "Bridging the gap between relativity and the undergraduate", [[Physics Today]] 23(12):48,8 {{doi|10.1063/1.3021868}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "during the post-[[Sputnik]] era, [[special relativity]] began to take its rightful place in the undergraduate curriculum". On the adoption of the Weltanschauung, he notes, "The historical impact of any world picture is ... partly attributable to the zeal of the promulgators and to the efficacy of their teachings."

Philosophers also distinguish the manifest image from the scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest ([[sc.]] obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it have to be that way?&lt;ref&gt;see Owen Flanagan's 'The Problem of the Soul', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will,&lt;ref&gt;see especially Daniel Dennett's 'Freedom Evolves', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the self and individuality, and the possibility of real or lived meaning.

== Characteristics ==
While [[Leo Apostel]] and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a [[community]] level, or in an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] way. For instance, if one's worldview is fixed by one's language, as according to a strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994) "[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration]" VUB Press. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel.&lt;/ref&gt; a worldview is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An [[explanation]] of the world
# A [[futurology]], answering the question "Where are we heading?"
# Values, answers to [[ethical]] questions: "What should we do?"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]]: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]: "What is [[truth|true]] and false?"
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.

== Classification of cultural worldviews ==
From across the world across all of the cultures, Roland Muller has suggested that cultural world views can be broken down into three separate world views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not simple enough to say that each person is one of these three cultures. Instead, each individual is a mix of the three. For example, a person may be raised in a Power–Fear society, in an Honor–Shame family, and go to school under a Guilt–Innocence system.

=== Guilt–Innocence ===
In a Guilt–Innocence focused culture, schools focus on deductive reasoning, cause and effect, good questions, and process. Issues are often seen as black and white. Written contracts are paramount. Communication is direct, and can be blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Three Colors of Worldview
| website = KnowledgeWorkx
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor–Shame ===
Societies with a predominantly Honor–Shame worldview teach children to make honorable choices according to the situations they find themselves in. Communication, interpersonal interaction, and business dealings are very relationship-driven, with every interaction having an effect on the Honor–Shame status of the participants. In an Honor–Shame society the crucial objective is to avoid shame and to be viewed honorably by other people. The Honor–Shame paradigm is especially strong in most regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power–Fear ===
Some cultures can be seen very clearly in operating under a Power–Fear worldview. In these cultures it is very important to assess the people around you and know where they fall in line according to their level of power. This can be used for good or for bad. A benevolent king rules with power and his citizens fully support him wielding that power. On the converse, a ruthless dictator can use his power to create a [[culture of fear]] where his citizens are oppressed.

==Streams in contemporary American thought==

According to [[Michael Lind]], "a worldview is a more or less coherent understanding of the nature of reality, which permits its holders to interpret new information in light of their preconceptions. Clashes among worldviews cannot be ended by a simple appeal to facts. Even if rival sides agree on the facts, people may disagree on conclusions because of their different premises." This is why politicians often seem to talk past one another, or ascribe different meanings to the same events. Tribal or national wars are often the result of incompatible worldviews. Lind has organized American political worldviews into five categories:
* [[Green politics|Green]] [[Malthusianism]] synthesizes mystical versions of [[environmentalism]] with alarm about population growth in the tradition of the Rev. Thomas Malthus
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[Isolationism]] would abandon foreign alliances, dismantle most of its military, and return to a 19th-century pattern of decentralized government and an economy based on small businesses and small farms.
* [[Neoliberal]] [[Globalism]] believes that at home governments should provide only basic public goods like infrastructure and security, and do so by market-friendly methods
* [[populism|Populist]] [[Nationalism]] tends to favor restriction of legal as well as illegal [[immigration]] to protect the core stock of the tribe-state from dilution by different races, ethnic groups or religions. Populist nationalism also tends to favor [[protectionist]] policies that shield workers and businesses, particularly small businesses, from foreign competition.
* [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] claims an economic safety net, protecting citizens from unemployment, sickness, poverty in old age and other disasters, is necessary if democratic government is to retain popular support.
Lind argues that even though not all people will fit neatly into only one category or the other, their core worldview shape how they frame their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Lind |title=The five worldviews that define American politics |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/12/lind_five_worldviews/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon Magazine]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and comparison==
One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of [[basic belief]]s which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview precisely because they are [[axiom]]s, and are typically argued ''from'' rather than argued ''for''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Daniel Hill and Randal Rauser ''Christian Philosophy A–Z'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2152-1}} p200&lt;/ref&gt; However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.&lt;ref&gt;In the Christian tradition this goes back at least to [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogues with Trypho, A Jew'', and has roots in the debates recorded in the [[New Testament]] For a discussion of the long history of religious dialogue in India, see [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''The Argumentative Indian''
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of [[cultural relativism]] and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from [[philosophical realist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5 ''Cognitive Relativism'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices.[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on Relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only "true for them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49207 Pope Benedict warns against relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Ratzinger, J. ''Relativism, the Central Problem for Faith Today'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subjective logic]] is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=9|issue=3|pages=279–311|doi=10.1142/S0218488501000831|last1=Jøsang|first1=Audun|title=A Logic For Uncertain Probabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher [[Ninian Smart]] begins his ''Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs'' with "Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews" and argues for "the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ninian Smart]] ''Worldviews: Crosscultural Explorations of Human Beliefs (3rd Edition)'' {{ISBN|0-13-020980-5}} p14
&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different [[presupposition]]s and cognitive values. Clément Vidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x|author=Vidal, Clément}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# ''objective'': objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# ''subjective'': subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# ''intersubjective'': intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

David Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962016344|title=SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND WORLD VIEWS.|last=BELL|first=DAVID|date=2016|publisher=GROSVENOR House PUBLISHING|isbn=9781786237668|location=Guildford, Surrey, UK|oclc=962016344}}&lt;/ref&gt; has raised interesting questions on worldviews for the designers of [[Superintelligence|superintelligences]] – machines much smarter than humans. &amp;nbsp;'Would they need worldviews, where would they get their worldviews and what would they be like?'. The answers would have to relate to, for example, Christian worldviews. Some of the people who consider features of superintelligences say they will have characteristics that are often associated with divinity, raising big open questions for Christian believers. For example, very advanced machines could, perhaps, &amp;nbsp; ultimately engender in people a terrified reverence and mystical awe in the light of, say, an artificial agent's impressive understanding of the human condition. And perhaps some humans might even be induced to 'worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator'? On the other hand what would the agent's relationship to God be? Anyone attempting to accommodate concepts such as an omnipotent, personal creator's sacrificial, emotional, spiritual and attitudinal demands being made of any man-made entity, superintelligent or not, could be said to have strayed into ''terra prohibita'' theologically, of course. And how would the worldviews of any superintelligences handle the relationships with what it might regard as its ''human'' 'creator'?
