'''''12: The Elements of Great Managing''''' is a 2006 ''New York Times'' bestseller written by Rodd Wagner and James K. Harter. It is the sequel to ''[[First, Break All the Rules]]'', although the first book was written by [[Marcus Buckingham]] and Curt Coffman. Both books are based on [[The Gallup Organization]]'s research on [[employee engagement]] and database of employee opinions.

== Content ==

''12'' tells the story of a dozen managers selected from Gallup's global database of 10 million interviews with managers and employees. Each of the chapters in ''12'' is based on one of the "Q&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;" statements that emerged from Gallup's [[meta-analysis]] comparing employee attitudes with workgroup performance. These range from employee's "knowing what's expected" and having the needed "materials and equipment" to more emotional assessments such as whether the employees feels his or her opinion counts and whether he or she has had chances to "learn and grow." The story of each manager profiled in the book is interrupted mid-chapter to describe the psychology behind the particular question Gallup asks in its employee surveys.

The most controversial of the statements, write Wagner and Harter, is the tenth: "I have best friend at work." The authors claim friendships, in combination with the other "elements," create better customer scores, better retention, better safety, and higher productivity and profitability. "In the battle between company policy and human nature, human nature always wins," states the book. "Companies do far better to harness this kind of social capital than to fight against it."

The book also includes a chapter on compensation. The authors assert that pay is such a "status-laden, envy-inspiring, politically charged monster" that it cannot be measured in the same way as the aspects that make up the bulk of the book. Being based in research on how people react in real life, rather than in theory, ''12'' is a mainstream application of [[behavioral economics]].

'''ACSOI (Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income)''' (also called Adjusted CSOI) is a non-[[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] accounting metric. 

The metric [[Amortization|amortizes]] marketing and acquisition costs over several accounting periods. The "Adjusted" part of the metric increases ("inflates") a company's reported net income in the  most recent accounting period.  The rationale behind the use of ACSOI is that marketing and subscriber acquisition expenses have value long into the future: they build a brand;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De la Merced|first=Michael J.|title=What is Adjusted CSOI?|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/the-groupon-i-p-o-what-is-adjusted-csoi/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=10 August 2011|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they should be spread out over time. Cash spent on marketing is not expensed: it is converted into another asset ("subscriber acquisition assets, net") on a company's [[balance sheet]].

This presentation of net income is prohibited by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], arbiters of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the United States. In GAAP, marketing expenses may be accrued in some situations as [[Prepaid_expense|prepaid expenses]], but only amortized in special cases. [[Deferred_Acquisition_Costs|Deferred acquisition costs]] are typically only allowed for amortizing the acquisition costs of customers in businesses like [[insurance]], where the amortization occurs over the well-defined duration of a contract. ACSOI can be a useful internal metric for businesses to determine financial performance and to make strategic management decisions, if they believe their subscriber acquisition costs are an up-front cash outlay that truly builds long-term customer assets commensurate with that outlay. A main argument for not using this metric in GAAP accounting is that there is a key difference between subscribers and customers: customers make purchases and generate [[revenue]] for the business; it may be faulty to assume that all subscriber acquisition costs can be amortized as assets if only an unknown portion of the acquired subscribers will actually convert to customers.

The use of ACSOI came under scrutiny in August 2011, when it was revealed the company [[Groupon]] used the metric to present a net gain in operating income in their [[initial public offering|IPO]] filing. Without the ACSOI metric, Groupon would have stated a net loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Groupon updates IPO filing, admits it's unprofitable|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/10/technology/groupon_accounting/index.htm?source=cnn_bin|publisher=CNN|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrus Ansip''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈɑndrus ˈɑnʲˑsʲip|est}}; born 1 October 1956) is an [[Estonia]]n politician, the current [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda|European Commissioner for Digital Single Market]] and [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice President]] of the European Commission, in office since 2014. Previously, he was [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] from 2005 to 2014 and chairman of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Estonian Reform Party]] ({{lang-et|Reformierakond}}) from 2004 to 2014.

Before his entry into politics Ansip trained as a chemist, before working in banking and business. He entered Parliament in 2004, quickly becoming Minister of Economic Affairs, and subsequently Prime Minister in April 2005. On 1 November 2014, he was appointed to the [[European Commission]].

==Early life and business career==
Born in [[Tartu]], Ansip graduated from the [[University of Tartu]] with a degree in [[Chemistry]] in 1979. He worked as an engineer at the university from 1979 to 1983 (with a two-year break for mandatory military service). He was an Instructor in the Industry Department and Head of the Organisational Department of the Tartu District Committee of the [[Estonian Communist Party]] from 1986 to 1988.&lt;ref name="officialCV"&gt;The Government of the Republic of Estonia: [http://www.valitsus.ee/en/government/prime-minister-and-ministers/andrus-ansip Andrus Ansip - Estonian Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813122749/http://www.valitsus.ee/en/government/prime-minister-and-ministers/andrus-ansip |date=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ansip has been involved in several banking and investment ventures. He has served as a Member of the Board of Directors of the People’s Bank of Tartu ({{lang-et|Rahvapank}}), Chairman of the Board of Livonia Privatisation IF, and CEO of Investment Fund Broker Ltd ({{lang-et|Fondiinvesteeringu Maakler AS}}). He also has served as [[Chairman of the board]] for [[Radio Tartu]].

==Political career==

===Mayor of Tartu===
In 1998, Ansip was elected as Mayor of [[Tartu]] as a candidate of the centrist-right ''Reformierakond'' (Reform Party), a position which he held until 2004, to great popular acclaim and very high ratings in the opinion polls. He had run in previous elections for the ''[[Riigikogu]]'', the Estonian Parliament, but had always given up his seat in order to remain Mayor. He was succeeded by fellow Reform Party member [[Laine Jänes]].

===Chairman of Reform Party and Minister of Economics===
On 21 November 2004, Ansip became Chairman of [[Estonian Reform Party]] because the party's founder and hitherto chairman, former Prime Minister [[Siim Kallas]], had become EU Commissioner and Vice President and thus had to move to [[Brussels]]. It was obvious that Ansip would have to move to [[Tallinn]], and a chance opened up when the Minister of Economic Affairs and Communications in the coalition government of [[Juhan Parts]], [[Meelis Atonen]], a party colleague, had to resign. Ansip became his successor on 13 September. His track record as Minister is more difficult to evaluate because of the short duration of his service.

===Prime Minister===
{{See also|Andrus Ansip's second cabinet|Andrus Ansip's third cabinet}}
On 31 March 2005, Ansip was charged by [[President of Estonia|President]] [[Arnold Rüütel]] to form a government, following 24 March 2005 resignation by Prime Minister Juhan Parts. Ansip was able to form a coalition with the [[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]] and the [[People's Union of Estonia]], which was approved by the Riigikogu on 12 April 2005. Ansip thus became Prime Minister of Estonia. He was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Riigikogu, 40 deputies voting against. He and the ministers were inaugurated in office the next day, on 13 April.

On 4 March 2007, Ansip's Reform Party won 27 percent of the vote in the Estonian parliamentary elections, raising its mandate in the Riigikogu to 31 seats from 19. Ansip personally received over 22,500 votes. He was charged by [[President of Estonia|President]] [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] to form a government. This time the Reform Party formed a coalition with the [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]] (IRL) and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]]. His second term as Prime Minister began on 5 April 2007. In May 2009, the Social Democrats left the government, and as coalition talks with the [[People's Union of Estonia]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} failed, it was decided to continue with a [[minority government]] of the Reform Party and IRL.

[[File:Prime Minister of Estonia Andrus Ansip (5373101682).jpg|thumb|Ansip at the UK Nordic Baltic Summit in London, 20 January 2011]]
In March 2011, the Reform Party won 33 seats in the Riigikogu, remaining the largest party even after the country's economic output had fallen by 14 percent in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the collapse of a real estate price bubble fueled by cheap and easy credit from Nordic banks.&lt;ref&gt;David Mardiste (4 March 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-estonia-pm-idUSBREA230J620140304 Estonian PM submits resignation: president's spokesman] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ansip was once again charged by [[President of Estonia|President]] [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] to form a government. The Reform Party continued in a coalition with the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica. Ansip's third term as Prime Minister began on 6 April 2011, when ''[[Riigikogu]]'' approved his third cabinet.

But Ansip's center-right coalition soon struggled in polls amid signs of voter fatigue at years of a government focused on fiscal austerity as well as several high-profile party funding scandals. The center-left opposition also gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;David Mardiste (4 March 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-estonia-pm-idUSBREA230J620140304 Estonian PM submits resignation: president's spokesman] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2014, Ansip announced his resignation to enable a successor to lead his party into [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 elections]]. From 4 December 2013 to 26 March 2014 he was the longest-serving [[prime minister]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name='longest-serving'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26430899|title=Estonia PM Ansip resigns - Europe's longest-serving PM|publisher=BBC News|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice President of the European Commission===
In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Estonia)|2014 European elections]], Ansip was elected as an MEP received the largest number of preferential votes in Estonia. Shortly after, Prime Minister [[Taavi Roivas]] nominated him as the country’s next European Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Keating (30 March 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/ansip-nominated-as-estonias-european-commissioner/ Ansip nominated as Estonia’s commissioner] ''[[European Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014 President-Elect [[Jean-Claude Juncker|Juncker]] of the [[European Commission]] announced that he proposed Andrus Ansip as [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] and the [[European Commissioner]] for the [[Digital Single Market]]. He was formally appointed by the [[European Council]] as Vice President with the consent of the [[European Parliament]].

==Relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn==
{{Main|Bronze Night}}
One of the most controversial actions of Ansip's government was relocation of the ''[[Bronze Soldier of Tallinn]]'' from a prominent location in the center of Tallinn to the [[Defence Forces Cemetery of Tallinn]] adjacent to the city center. The removal of the monument, as well as war graves, from its current location on 27 April 2007 led to mass protests and two nights of the worst rioting Estonia has seen since regaining independence.&lt;ref name="BBC28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6602171.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Tallinn tense after deadly riots|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eesti Päevaleht Online"&gt;[http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/383785 Olukord tänavatel on rahulik] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Andrus Ansip is married to [[gynecologist]] Anu Ansip (b. 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rotary.tartu.ee/liikmed/Ansip_Andrus.htm|title=Tartu Rotary klubi|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have three daughters Reet (b. 1977), who is a [[stomatology|stomatologist]]; Tiina (b. 1981) who is a [[journalism|journalist]] and Liisa (b. 1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miksike.ee/docs/referaadid2006/ansip_ehanaesalu.htm Referaat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrus Ansip is a member of the Estonian voluntary home guard organisation [[Kaitseliit]] (Defence League) since 10 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neljas.ee/est/tallinn/?news=994059 Andrus Ansip sai kätte Kaitseliidu liikmepileti] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720130408/http://www.neljas.ee/est/tallinn/?news=994059 |date=20 July 2011 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2245">A '''Back-to-back loan''' is a loan agreement between entities in two countries in which the currencies remain separate but the maturity dates remain fixed. The gross [[interest rate]]s of the loan are separate as well and are set on the basis of the commercial rates in place when the agreement is signed.&lt;ref name=zam&gt;{{cite book|title=Bank contingency financing: risks, rewards, and opportunities|author=Andrew J. Zamora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMY44jpYyhkC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=back+to+back+loan+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gBnwS7D3KYOKNabr8McE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20back%20loan%20definition&amp;f=false|year=1990|ISBN=978-0-471-60894-3|pages=74–75|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most back-to-back loans come due within 10 years, due to their inherent risks.&lt;ref name=zam/&gt; Initiated as a way of avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by [[currency swap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The handbook of international financial terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyL2Uw0sc5IC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=back+to+back+loan+currency&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qyDwS7KDJYHCM7nogKkM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20back%20loan%20currency&amp;f=false|author=Peter Moles, Nicholas Terry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=32|ISBN=978-0-19-828885-5|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a specific agreement, when one party defaults on the loan, the other party may still be held responsible for repayment.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite book|title=Global corporate finance: text and cases|year=2006|author=Suk H. Kim, Seung Hee Kim|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|pages=181–182|ISBN=978-1-4051-1990-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage in comparison with currency swaps is that back-to-back loan transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their [[capital requirements|capitalization requirements]], while currency swaps were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

'''CPA Australia''' ("'''Certified Practising Accountant'''") is a professional [[accountancy|accounting]] body in [[Australia]] founded in 1886, with over 150,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/Certificates+issued+by+a+qualified+accountant|title=Certificates issued by a qualified accountant|website=[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPA Australia currently has 19 staffed offices across Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, New Zealand and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/|title=CPA Australia|website=www.cpaaustralia.com.au|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The current form of CPA Australia dates from 1952, when the Commonwealth Institute and Federal Institute merged to create the Australian Society of Accountants. In July 1990 the name changed to the Australian Society of Certified Practicing Accountants, and in April 2000, the name became CPA Australia.&lt;ref&gt;CPA Australia Handbook, 1995, p11021&lt;/ref&gt;

The main predecessor bodies of the Society, with year of formation, were:
*Incorporated Institute of Accountants, 1886 
*Federal Institute of Accountants, 1894
*Association of Accountants of Australia, 1910
*Australasian Institute of Cost Accountants, 1920

===CEO controversy===
The CEO of CPA Australia from 2008, [[Alex Malley]], came under significant criticism in the media and from CPA members in 2017 for his $1.8 million annual salary and for the significant amounts of CPA funds going towards promoting Malley and his personal interests, such as [[In Conversation with Alex Malley|a paid television show]] and Malley's autobiography.&lt;ref name="Aston"/&gt; The scandal surrounding Malley, combined with broader member discontent over executive changes that made the board unaccountable and debts accrued from the establishment of a financial planning arm, led to the resignation of the CPA president Tyrone Carlin in May 2017, and then to two board members resigning a week later in June 2017. The resigning board members, [[Richard Alston (politician)|Richard Alston]] and Kerry Ryan, cited the presence of "board allies of chief executive Alex Malley" refusing to "allow a wide-ranging review of Mr Malley and the organisation" as their main reason.&lt;ref name=AFR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Joe|last2=Tadros|first2=Edmund|last3=Patrick|first3=Aaron|last4=Durkin|first4=Patrick|title=Richard Alston quits CPA Australia board over governance|url=http://www.afr.com/business/accounting/richard-alston-quits-cpa-board-over-governance-20170607-gwmemo|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=Australian Financial Review|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board resignations had also followed former Future Fund Chairman and Commonwealth Bank CEO, [[David Murray (Australian businessman)|David Murray]], who resigned his 40-year CPA membership in response to what he saw as poor management within CPA.&lt;ref name=AFR/&gt;

On 15 June, a further three directors resigned due to the expanding scandal surrounding Malley and the remaining board initiated an "independent review" of all claims made against CPA and its CEO, to be chaired by former chief of the Australian Defence Force, [[Angus Houston|Sir Angus Houston]].&lt;ref name="Aston"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Joe|title=Alex Malley: What a difference a year makes|url=http://www.afr.com/news/economy/alex-malley-what-a-difference-a-year-makes-20180123-h0n1o3|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=Australian Financial Review|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even the decision to create the review came under criticism when it was revealed that Houston had appeared as guest on Malley's TV program and had written a glowing foreword in Malley's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Letts|first1=Stephen|title=CPA chief Alex Malley keeps his job but faces 'fiercely independent' review over ongoing controversy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-16/cpa-chief-alex-malley-keeps-job-as-review-established/8625388|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=ABC News|date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston later resigned his post in favour of former [[Australian National Audit Office|Commonwealth Auditor-General]], Ian McPhee.&lt;ref name="Aston"/&gt;

Facing a significant swelling of discontent amongst CPA members, in June 2017 it was announced that the CPA board had terminated the contract of Malley, resulting in CPA paying out the remainder of his contract to the sum of $4.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hobday|first1=Liz|title=CPA terminates contract with chief executive Alex Malley|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-23/cpa-terminates-contract-with-chief-executive-alex-malley/8648212|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=ABC News|date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Joe|last2=Tadros|first2=Edmund|title=CPA Australia CEO Alex Malley sacked|url=http://www.afr.com/leadership/cpa-australia-ceo-alex-malley-sacked-20170623-gwxn30|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=Australian Financial Review|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the developing scandal, [[Sydney Morning Herald]] journalist Colin Kruger noted: "Accountancy is meant to be the profession of sober financial clarity. [...] Not the sort of profession for flashy types, accountants are meant to be the score keepers, not the goal scorers. It makes the lack of accountability, and financial clarity, from the top accounting body in Australia – CPA Australia – all the more incongruous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kruger|first1=Colin|title=Alex Malley, CPA Australia's 'Naked CEO' who walked off with $4.9m|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/alex-malley-cpa-australias-naked-ceo-who-walked-off-with-49m-20170622-gww5jx.html|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, it was announced that the remaining board members would resign their positions at the end of the year, to make way for an entirely new board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tadros|first1=Edmund|title=Inside story of Alex Malley's final days at CPA Australia|url=http://www.afr.com/business/accounting/inside-story-of-the-alex-malleys-final-days-at-cpa-australia-20170727-gxjr73|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=Australian Financial Review|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent review report released in September 2017 found that the "chief executive was overpaid, [CPA Australia] had lost touch with its members and provided questionable value for money for the services it rendered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Letts|first1=Stephen|title=CPA review finds CEO overpaid and organisation 'out of touch' with members|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-14/cpa-review-finds-ceo-overpaid-and-out-of-touch-with-members/8947318|accessdate=21 March 2018|agency=ABC News|date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to CPA's "over-emphasis on marketing and brand building activities that centred on the former CEO", the review in particular noted the excessive CEO's salary, with its many increases over several years not being justified by organisational growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pash|first1=Chris|title=CHARTS: How the salary of CPA Australia's chief executive grew faster than membership|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-how-the-salary-of-cpa-australias-chief-executive-grew-faster-than-membership-2017-9|accessdate=7 May 2018|agency=Business Insider Australia|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''DARPA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]] responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

Originally known as the '''Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''ARPA'''), the agency was created in February 1958 by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in response to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] launching of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate [[U.S. military]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Commission2008"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science &amp; Technology, (2008). Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101027163454/http://eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20%26%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20%28v2%29.pdf Source].&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as [[computer networking]] and the basis for the modern Internet, and [[graphical user interface]]s in information technology.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has about 220 employees, of whom approximately 100 are in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa|title=About DARPA|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972, momentarily changing back to ARPA in February 1993, only to revert to DARPA in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/arpa-darpa-and-jason/|title=ARPA, DARPA, and Jason - Military Embedded Systems|website=mil-embedded.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, DARPA's mission statement is "to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |title=DARPA Mission |last= |first= |date= |website=www.darpa.mil |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430171501/http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |archivedate=2017-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==History==
[[File:DARPA through 50 years.ogv|thumb|right|DARPA achievements for the past 50 years]]

===Early history (1959–1969)===
The creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was authorized by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements,&lt;ref name="Commission2008"/&gt; the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_year_1958_supplemental_military_c.html?id=N-IPAAAAIAAJ |title = Fiscal Year 1958 Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force): Hearings, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9739 |date=1958|author1 = Subcommittee On Military Construction |first1 = United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Armed Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of [[Sputnik]] and to U.S. realization that the [[Soviet Union]] had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards20 &gt;"$ 520 million appropriation and a $ 2 billion budget plan." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 20). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA.&lt;ref name = Wizards21 &gt;"Roy Johnson, ARPA’s first director, was, like his boss, a businessman. At age fifty-two, he had been personally recruited by McElroy, who convinced him to leave a $160,000 job with General Electric and take an $18,000 job in Washington." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert York]] from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was hired as his scientific assistant.&lt;ref name = Wizards21a &gt;"Herbert York, whom Killian had been keen on, was given the job and moved to ARPA from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when [[NASA]] was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do "high-risk", "high-gain", "far out" basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities.&lt;ref name = Wizards21,22 &gt;"The staff of ARPA saw an opportunity to redefine the agency as a group that would take on the really advanced "far-out" research....The scientific community, predictably, rallied to the call for a reinvention of ARPA as a "high-risk high-gain" research sponsor— the kind of R&amp; D shop they had dreamed of all along" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 21,22). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961. He was succeeded by [[Jack Ruina]] who served until 1963.&lt;ref name = Wizards23,24 &gt;"In early 1961 ARPA’s second director, Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, resigned" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 23,24) Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards23 &gt;"Ruina raised ARPA’s annual budget to $ 250 million." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruina who hired [[J. C. R. Licklider]] as the first administrator of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]], which played a vital role in creation of [[ARPANET]], the basis for the future Internet.&lt;ref name = Wizards27-39  &gt;"J. C. R. Licklider." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 27–39). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&amp;D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.&lt;ref name = Wizards23a &gt;projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&amp;D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&amp;D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629003311/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-29 |title=The Story of GPS |author=Catherine Alexandrow |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gap&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/first_50_years.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506103713/http://www.darpa.mil/About/History/First_50_Years.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-06 |title=DARPA: 50 Years of Bridging the Gap |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |author1=Stefanie Chiou |author2=Craig Music |author3=Kara Sprague |author4=Rebekah Wahba |date=5 Dec 2001 |title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101306/http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael |title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516195054/http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History%3ABertram_Raphael |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].

===Later history (1970–1980)===
The [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.

The resulting "[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===Recent history (1981–present)===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or [[Hypersonic Research Program (DARPA)|Hypersonic Research Program]]. The [[Strategic Computing Program (DARPA)|Strategic Computing Program]] enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

On October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', "Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground", October 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.&lt;ref name="Building X Planes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |title=NASA and DARPA plan to release new X-Planes |last=Grady |first=Mary |date=June 5, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=June 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120846/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |title=Darpa to create Cyber Grand Challenge to fight security vulnerabilities |last=Howley |first=Daniel |date=17 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190614/https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |archivedate=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern [[anti-tank weapon]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/darpa-gxv-t-demonstration-military-vehicle-technology/55198/ "DARPA demonstrates 6 new technologies behind the agile combat vehicles of tomorrow"] New Atlas, June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Current program offices===
DARPA has six technical offices that manage the agency's research portfolio, and two additional support offices that manage special projects and transition efforts.{{clarify |reason= there are seven offices listed, instead the expected eight|date=September 2017}} All offices report to the DARPA director:

* The [[Adaptive Execution Office (DARPA)|Adaptive Execution Office (AEO)]] is one of two new DARPA offices created in 2009 by the DARPA Director, [[Regina Dugan]]. The office's four project areas include technology transition, assessment, rapid [[productivity]] and [[adaptive system]]s. AEO provides the agency with robust connections to the warfighter community and assists the agency with the planning and execution of technology demonstrations and field trials to promote adoption by the warfighter, accelerating the transition of new technologies into DoD capabilities. 
* The [[Defense Sciences Office|Defense Sciences Office (DSO)]] vigorously pursues the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and develops those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |title=DARPA/DSO Home Page |date=2 December 1998 |website=archive.org |accessdate=6 June 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202153000/http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |archivedate=2 December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSO identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff fundamental research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines – sometimes reshaping existing fields or creating entirely new disciplines – and transforms these initiatives into radically new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security.&amp;nbsp;
* The [[Information Innovation Office|Information Innovation Office (I2O)]] aims to ensure U.S. technological superiority in all areas where information can provide a decisive military advantage. Some of the program managers in I2O are Wade Shen (as of December 2014), Stuart Wagner (as of September 2014), Steve Jameson (as of August 2014), Angelos Keromytis (as of July 2014), and David Doermann (as of April 2014). Brian Pierce is currently the office director.
* The [[Microsystems Technology Office|Microsystems Technology Office (MTO)]] mission focuses on the heterogeneous microchip-scale integration of electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Their high risk/high payoff technology is aimed at solving the national level problems of protection from biological, chemical and information attack and to provide operational dominance for mobile distributed command and control, combined manned/unmanned warfare, and dynamic, adaptive military planning and execution.
* The [[Strategic Technology Office (DARPA)|Strategic Technology Office (STO)]] mission is to focus on technologies that have a global theater-wide impact and that involve multiple Services.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051855/http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }} DARPA Offices. Retrieved 2009-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tactical Technology Office (DARPA)|Tactical Technology Office (TTO)]] engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the "system" and "subsystem" approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems. 
* The [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|Biological Technologies Office (BTO)]] fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security. Created in April 2014 by then director [[Arati Prabhakar]], taking programs from the MTO and DSO divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2014-04-01|title=DARPA Launches Biological Technologies Office |date=1 April 2014 |website=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former offices===
* [[Information Awareness Office]]: 2002–2003
* The [[Advanced Technology Office (DARPA)|Advanced Technology Office (ATO)]] researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Special Projects Office (DARPA)|Special Projects Office (SPO)]] researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The [[Information Systems Office| Information Systems Office (ISO)]] in the 1990s developed system applications of advanced information technologies.  It was a predecessor to the Information Exploitation Office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708012812/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-08 | work=Defense Daily | title=DARPA restructures/creates new offices | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Electronic Systems Technology Office]] combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office. This new office will focus on the boundary between general-purpose computers and the physical world, such as sensors, displays and the first few layers of specialized signal-processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces.
* The [[Computing Systems Technology Office]] combined functions of the old Information Sciences and Tactical Technology office. The office "will work scalable parallel and distributed heterogeneous computing systems technologies", DoD said.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office]] and the [[Computing Systems office]] will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High-Performance Computing Initiative. The Software office will also be responsible for "software systems technology, [[machine intelligence]] and software engineering".
* The [[Land Systems Office]] was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti-armor systems, once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office
* The [[Undersea Warfare Office]] combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counterstealth and automation.
Reorganization in 2010 merged two offices:
* The [[Transformational Convergence Technology Office (DARPA)|Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO)]] mission was to advance new crosscutting capabilities derived from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends, particularly in areas related to computing and computing-reliant subareas of the life sciences, social sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The TCTO was folded into the I2O in 2010.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |title=Embedded Clouds: A Look Back at HPEC 2010 |work=HPCwire |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707185535/http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |archivedate=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Information Processing Techniques Office|Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO)]] focused on inventing the networking, computing, and software technologies vital to ensuring DOD military superiority. The IPTO was combined with TCTO in 2010 to form the I2O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |title=Schedule – sxsw.com |work=SXSW Schedule 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909201234/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |archivedate=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first husband was John Mackenzie Robertson with whom she had one daughter, Wendy Mackenzie. Her second husband was Dale Wilford Maher, the first Secretary of the U. S. [[Legation]] in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] (died 1948).&lt;ref name=whowas&gt;''Who Was Who in America with World Notables'', Vol. 2, The A.N. Marquis Co., Chicago, 1949, page 341.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a daughter Marigold Randall. In 1953, Drue became the third wife of [[H. J. Heinz II]] (1908&amp;ndash;1987), then president of [[Heinz]] company and heir to the Heinz fortune.&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; With Heinz she became the stepmother of [[H. John Heinz III|John Heinz]] (1938&amp;ndash;1991) who later became a [[Pennsylvania]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]].&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt;

Prior to her marriage to Heinz she was an actress. As "Doreen English" she had a small role in the 1948 movie ''[[Uneasy Terms]]'', which starred [[Michael Rennie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/name/nm1024268/ Doreen English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; entry], IMDB.com.

The Heinz home in Pittsburgh was called "Goodwood", in [[Sewickley Heights]].&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; They also had an apartment in New York's Upper East Side, and a winter retreat in [[Hobe Sound, Florida]].&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; For many years, their British home was [[Ascot Place]] at [[North Ascot]] in [[Winkfield]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt;

Heinz would buy houses, restore them and turn them into writers' retreats.&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; She purchased [[Hawthornden Castle]], a medieval fortress outside [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] and made it into a place for writers to live and work called the Hawthornden Literary Retreat.&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; The Heinz Italian home, called Villa Maresi, was on [[Lake Como]] in the town of [[Griante]].&lt;ref name=heinzendow/&gt; She called it "Casa Ecco", and writers would go there for discussions.&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; "She was very close to [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Harold Pinter]] and [[Antonia Fraser]]," according to Daniel Halpern, founder of Ecco Press.&lt;ref name=pitz/&gt; She was reportedly close friends with [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Le Carré]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Edna O’Brien]] and [[Seamus Heaney]].&lt;ref name=heinzendow/&gt;

Of her character, [[Teresa Heinz]] said "Drue was a very private person but she came to know an amazing group of people in her life. She was smart and passionate and deeply interested in art, literature, and especially poetry."&lt;ref name=heinzendow/&gt; Of her reputation, [[Jonathan Galassi]], President, [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], said 
:"Drue Heinz was the great literary philanthropist of our time. The institutions she created and/or supported – among them The Drue Heinz Prize, Antaeus, The Ecco Press and The Paris Review in the United States and the Hawthornden Prize and Hawthornden Castle in the U.K., to name only a few – are monuments to the seriousness and long-standing of her commitments; but it was her personal involvement, her long friendships with J. Laughlin, George Plimpton, and countless writers and editors, that made her generosity so impactful."&lt;ref name=heinzendow/&gt;

'''Edgar Miles Bronfman''' (June 20, 1929 – December 21, 2013) was a [[Canadian-American]] businessman and philanthropist. He worked for his family [[distilled beverage]] firm, [[Seagram]], eventually becoming president, treasurer and [[CEO]]. As President of the [[World Jewish Congress]], Bronfman is especially remembered for initiating diplomacy with the Soviet Union, which resulted in legitimizing the Hebrew language in Russia, and contributed to Soviet Jews being legally able to practice their own religion, as well as emigrate to Israel.

They raised their four children in Montreal.

In 1925, Sam and his brother, Allan, built the family’s first liquor distillery near Montreal. They later bought a distillery owned by the Seagram family and incorporated the name. The U.S. subsidiary of the Seagram Company Ltd. opened in 1933; Edgar Bronfman would later take charge of the [[subsidiary]].&lt;ref&gt;Kandell, Jonathan (22 December 2013). "Edgar M. Bronfman, Who Brought Elegance and Expansion to Seagram, Dies at 84". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronfman had two older sisters: [[architect]] [[Phyllis Lambert]], and Minda de Gunzburg, who married Baron Alain de Gunzburg (1925-2004), a great grandson of [[Joseph Günzburg]]. Bronfman also had a younger brother, [[Charles Bronfman]]. The Bronfmans "kept a kosher home, and the children received religious schooling on weekends. But during the week Edgar and his younger brother, Charles, were among a handful of Jews sent to private Anglophone schools, where they attended chapel and ate pork."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-obit" /&gt;

Bronfman attended [[Selwyn House School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/culture/books-and-authors/the-invisible-thread-that-unites-all-jews The invisible thread that unites all Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; in Montreal, and [[Trinity College School]] in [[Port Hope, Ontario]], Canada. He next  attended [[Williams College]], then transferred to [[McGill University]], where he graduated from in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in commerce.&lt;ref name=WorldJewishCongress /&gt;

==Career==

===Seagram===
[[File:Edgar and Sam Bronfman.JPG|thumb|right|Edgar M. Bronfman with his father, Sam Bronfman]]
After graduating from [[McGill University]] with a B.A. degree, in 1951, he joined the family business, where he worked as an accounting clerk and apprentice taster. In 1953, he took over as head of the Seagram U.S. [[subsidiary]], Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons. He increased the range of products sold by the company, improved distribution, and expanded the number of countries in which Seagram's products were sold. In 1966, [[Cemp Investments]], which managed the family's investments, bought 820,000 shares of [[MGM]] and, in 1969, Bronfman took over the chairmanship of MGM, albeit briefly.

Following his father's death, in 1971, Bronfman took over as president, treasurer and director of Distillers Corporation-Seagram Ltd. His son, [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.|Edgar Jr.]], succeeded him as [[chief executive officer]] of the company in 1994.&lt;ref name="EncyclBritannica-Seagram"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Seagram Company Ltd.|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/530859/Seagram-Company-Ltd|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Jewish Congress ===
When former [[World Jewish Congress]] President [[Philip Klutznick]] stepped down in 1979, Bronfman was asked to take over as acting head of the organization, then was formally elected President by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, in January 1981.&lt;ref name="NYT-WJC-presidency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bronfman Heads Jewish Congress|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/world/bronfman-heads-jewish-congress.html|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his deputy, [[Israel Singer]], Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent international Jewish organization that it is today. Initiatives such as those seeking to help free Soviet Jewry; expose Austrian President [[Kurt Waldheim]]'s [[Nazi]] past; and to help victims of [[the Holocaust]] and their heirs to acquire compensation (including by Swiss banks); raised Bronfman's international profile during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Philanthropist Edgar Bronfman Passes Away at 84 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Edgar-Bronfman-passes-away-at-84-335767 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz-obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pfeffer|first=Anshel|title=1929–2013: Edgar Bronfman: Born too late be a Rothschild, too early to be an oligarch|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/.premium-1.564850|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-philanthropist"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bookstein|first=Rabbi Yonah|title=Will Anyone Fill Bronfman’s Chair?|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/rabbi_yonah/item/will_anyone_fill_bronfmans_chair|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=Jewish Journal|date=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Billionaire Businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr. Dies: Bronfman Headed the World Jewish Congress for More Than a Quarter Century|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304020704579273522314141850|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 22, 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Initiatives ====

===== Soviet Jewry =====
In 1983, Bronfman suggested that "American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]], as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind."&lt;ref name="CongrRecord-1990Letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE JACKSON/VANIK AMENDMENT AND MFN FOR THE SOVIET UNION – HON.

After [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's ''New York Times'' message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from [[Shimon Peres]], Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.&lt;ref name=Gone /&gt;{{rp|457}}

In a ''Washington Post'' profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade&amp;nbsp;... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." Author Gal Beckerman says in his ''When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone'', "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration."&lt;ref name=Gone /&gt;{{rp|458}}

In March 1987, Bronfman along with fellow delegates of the World Jewish Congress, flew to Moscow once again. Bronfman held three days of discussions with senior Soviet officials. Together, Bronfman and the World Jewish Congress delegates advocated for the freeing of the Jews living under Soviet rule.

On June 25, 1982, Bronfman became the first representative of a Jewish organization to speak before the [[United Nations]]. Speaking before the Special Session on Disarmament, Bronfman said, "world peace cannot tolerate the denial of the legitimacy of Israel or any other nation-state ... [and the] charge that Zionism is racism is an abomination."&lt;ref name="JTA-UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bronfman Says World Peace Can’t Allow Denial of Israel’s Legitimacy|url=http://www.jta.org/1982/06/28/archive/bronfman-says-world-peace-cant-allow-denial-of-israels-legitimacy|work=JTA: The Global Jewish News Source|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=22 December 2013|date=June 28, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronfman's goals for the visit were threefold. In his book, ''The Making of a Jew,'' he explained: First, he called for the release of all so-called Prisoners of Zion, the Jews imprisoned for expressing a desire to emigrate to Israel. Bronfman also wanted freedom for Jews in the Soviet Union to practice their religion. Finally, he called for the freedom for Soviet Jews to learn Hebrew, which was forbidden at the time.&lt;ref name="EMB-MakingJew"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronfman|first=Edgar M.|title=The making of a Jew|year=1996|publisher=Putnam |location=New York |isbn=9780399142208 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in 1988, Bronfman returned to Moscow to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. This trip resulted in the Soviets promising to legalize the teaching of Hebrew in the Soviet Union and to establish a Jewish cultural center in Moscow. Bronfman said of this visit, "By their actions, they are indicating that they are eager to get the question of Jewish rights and emigration off the bargaining table. And it is actions, rather than simply words, that count."&lt;ref name="WJCA-Tribute"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edgar Bronfman Tribute Book|publisher=World Jewish Congress Archives|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Kurt Waldheim =====
In 1986, during Bronfman's presidency, the World Jewish Congress accused Austrian President Kurt Waldheim of covering up his past connections to the Nazi party. It was when Waldheim became a candidate for president that the World Jewish Congress first published material showing Waldheim's active duty in the German army during wartime. This evidence was later used to prove that Waldheim must have known about the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, though Waldheim's service as an Austrian in the German army cannot be considered a war crime. Waldheim had served as an intelligence officer in a unit of the army that participated in the transfer of Greek Jews to death camps.&lt;ref name="JTA-Waldheim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bronfman Says Waldheim Dropped Suit ‘because He Has No Case’|url=http://www.jta.org/1988/07/05/archive/bronfman-says-waldheim-dropped-suit-because-he-has-no-case|work=JTA: The Global Jewish News Source|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=July 5, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations against Waldheim resulted in public embarrassment for the Austrian president.

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was "part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.&lt;ref name="JTA-Waldheim"/&gt;

According to Joel Bainerman, in 1991 he was appointed to the International Jewish Committee for Inter-religious Consultations to conduct official contacts between the Vatican and the State of Israel.&lt;ref name="Bainerman-VaticanAgenda"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bainerman|first=Joel|title=The Vatican Agenda|url=http://www.joelbainerman.com/articles/vatican.asp|work=JoelBainerman.com|accessdate=24 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116130558/http://www.joelbainerman.com/articles/vatican.asp|archivedate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Swiss bank restitution =====
In the late 1990s, Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors.&lt;ref name="NYT-SwissReject"&gt;{{cite news|title=World News Briefs; Swiss Reject Finding Of $3 Billion Gold Debt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/08/world/world-news-briefs-swiss-reject-finding-of-3-billion-gold-debt.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-PriceTagBillions"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|title=A Price Tag Of Billions In Nazi Gold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/world/a-price-tag-of-billions-in-nazi-gold.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks.&lt;ref name="JPost-Legend"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dori|first=Yoram|title=Opinion: Edgar Bronfman, the legend|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Edgar-Bronfman-the-legend-335828|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=Jewish Post|date=December 22, 2013|language=English |translator-first=Hannah |translator-last=Hochner}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement aimed to resolve claims "that they hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis".&lt;ref name="JewishWeek-Holbrooke-Swiss"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ain|first=Stewart|title=Short Takes: Holbrooke’s Swiss Bank Diplomacy|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short_takes/holbrookes_swiss_bank_diplomacy|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Week|date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes-Bronfman-interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell Mead|first=Walter|title=Los Angeles Times Interview: Edgar Bronfman Sr.: Tracking Nazi Plunder Into Switzerland's Secret Vaults|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-13/opinion/op-48341_1_swiss-banks|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss banks, the United States Government, and Jewish groups investigated unclaimed assets deposited by European Jews into Swiss banks before the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="NewsHour-SwissAccount"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ponce|first=Phil|title=Swiss Accountability|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec98/swiss_8-13.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer Transcript|date=August 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations began in 1995 between the U.S. and Switzerland.

In exchange for the settlement money, both parties agreed to release the Swiss banks and government from any claims regarding the Holocaust.

===Marriages and children===
Bronfman was married five times (twice to his third wife).

* Ann Margaret Loeb (1932–2011). In 1953, he married Loeb, a [[Jewish-American]] banking heiress. Loeb was the daughter of [[John Langeloth Loeb Sr.]] (a [[Wall Street]] [[investment banker]] whose company– which he had co-founded with his father –was a predecessor of [[Shearson Lehman]]/[[American Express]]), and [[Frances Lehman]] (a scion of the [[Lehman Brothers]] banking firm).

The captors, both natives of [[Ireland]], former limousine operator, Dominic Byrne, and his neighbor, former fireman Mel Patrick Lynch– "who claimed that he and whisky heir Samuel Bronfman were homosexual lovers," and "claimed that Bronfman’s nine-day disappearance in August 1975 was a hoax abduction engineered by the 23-year-old whisky heir himself" –were acquitted of kidnapping, but convicted of extortion charges and spent several years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/NewmanPeterCharlesBronfmanDynasty.o/Newman_Peter_Charles_-_Bronfman_Dynasty.o#page/n119/mode/2up/search/lynch Newman, Peter C.] ''The Bronfman Dynasty''; Mcclelland &amp; Stewart-Bantam Limited; Canada; 1978. {{ISBN|9780771067587}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ransom money was recovered.&lt;ref name="Record/Herald-AnnLeobBronfman-obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann Loeb Bronfman: Obituary |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/northjersey/obituary.aspx?n=ann-loeb-bronfman&amp;pid=150117047 |work=Legacy.com|publisher=The Record/Herald News|accessdate=24 December 2013|date=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Melanie Mann.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE2DE1E3CE334BC4052DFB566838D669EDE New York Times: "Notes on People; Abducted Bronfman Son to Wed"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine article reported that Bronfman took a course from [[NXIVM]], endorsing it, but had since "grown troubled" due to the "emotional and financial investment" daughters Clare and Sara were giving to [[Keith Raniere|Raniere's]] group, remarking that [[Clare Bronfman|Clare]] had loaned NXIVM $2 million, though she denied this. Bronfman was quoted stating, "I think it's a cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman| first=Michael |title=Cult of Personality|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/1013/088.html#2d0f43511853Cult|accessdate=25 July 2018|newspaper=Forbes|date=13 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Raniere, then daughter Clare and her long-time mentor NXIVM president [[Nancy Salzman]], among others, were arrested on federal charges in connection with NXIVM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/feds-arrest-seagram-heiress-bronfman-nxivm-sex-slave-case-n894136|title=Seagram heiress Bronfman pleads not guilty in NXIVM 'sex slave' case|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, daughter Sara was named the [[defendant]] in a 2018 [[class-action]] suit regarding her NXIVM activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saul |first1=Emily |title=Another Seagram’s heiress sued in Nxivm ‘sex cult’ case |url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/04/another-seagrams-heiress-sued-in-nxivm-sex-cult-case/ |accessdate=12 September 2018 |publisher=New York Post |date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Hillel Uruguay.jpg|thumb|Bronfman at the founding of Hillel of Uruguay]]
Bronfman was a [[philanthropist]] who gave large amounts of money to Jewish causes, including [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life]], which he was credited with helping revive together with Hillel President [[Richard Joel]] in the 1990s. The Hillel at [[New York University]] is called The Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life, known by students just as "Bronfman".&lt;ref name="JWeekly-raise-glasses"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wiener|first=Julie|title=Bronfman brothers give Jews reason to raise glasses|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/13538/bronfman-brothers-give-jews-reason-to-raise-glasses/|work=jweekly.com|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=24 December 2013|date=June 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronfman established the Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a leadership program for Jewish youth, and provided the funding for [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ MyJewishLearning.com], a digital media entity that includes [http://www.kveller.com/ Kveller], a popular Jewish parenting site.&lt;ref name="JTA-obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edgar Bronfman, philanthropist and Jewish communal leader, dies at 84|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/21/news-opinion/obituaries/edgar-bronfman-84-leading-philanthropist-and-jewish-communal-leader|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA: The Global Jewish News Source]]|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|accessdate=22 December 2013|date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother has a concert hall named after her in Montreal, the Saidye Bronfman Centre, and a building at McGill University is named after his father.

Bronfman was also the Founder and President of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation, whose work is informed by these four principles: "Jewish renaissance is grounded in Jewish learning, Jewish youth shape the future of the Jewish people, vibrant Jewish communities are open and inclusive, and that all Jews are a single family."&lt;ref name=SBF&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Mission |url=http://thesbf.org/mission.html |publisher=The Samuel Bronfman Foundation |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718010722/http://www.thesbf.org/mission.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major points of focus for The Samuel Bronfman Foundation are pluralism, intermarriage, community engagement – especially youth – and making Jewish knowledge accessible to Jews of all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="NY1-Mishkin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mishkin|first=Budd|title=One On 1: Edgar Bronfman Blends Family Legacy With Personal Cause|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/pages/98502/one-on-1--edgar-bronfman-blends-family-legacy-with-personal-cause|work=NY1|publisher=Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC|accessdate=24 December 2013|date=May 6, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115507/http://www.ny1.com/content/pages/98502/one-on-1--edgar-bronfman-blends-family-legacy-with-personal-cause|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for its work with the following grantees:

In an article, journalist Ami Eden writes about Bronfman, who chose to incorporate meaningful Jewish traditions into his life, all the while continuing to educate himself about the religion until his final days.
Bronfman also promoted the idea that Jewish organizations needed to stop using fear as a selling point, but rather encourage ordinary Jews to take a deeper interest in the substantive heritage they have been born to. Specifically, while much of the American Jewish community saw intermarriage as an epidemic to be curbed, Bronfman considered the trend an opportunity for Jews to learn further with their non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sokol |first=Sam |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Edgar-Bronfman-passes-away-at-84-335767 |title=Jewish philanthropist Edgar Bronfman passes away at 84 &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date=2013-12-22 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34761">The '''Employers' Association of Greater Chicago''' ('''EA''') was a [[nonprofit]] [[voluntary association|association]] of employers based in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago in 1903, although it was also known colloquially as the Chicago Employers' Association.  Its goal was to oppose the unionization of companies in the Chicago area, and assist unionized companies in deunionization.

Over time, the organization's commitment to union avoidance lessened greatly and the organization became more heavily involved in traditional [[human resources]] training and consulting.  The organization changed its name to the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago in 1959, and merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association in 1981.

==Founding and early years==
The group was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago (the EA) in 1902 during a [[Strike action|strike]] against telephone equipment manufacturers.

In January 1902, Brass Molder's Union Local 83 struck [[Stromberg-Carlson]] and [[Western Electric]], seeking to win the [[closed shop]] in [[collective bargaining]] negotiations. The employers [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] the workers and brought in [[strikebreaker]]s. Union members began attacking the strikebreakers.  On May 7, 1903, the union struck the [[Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company]]. Kellogg Switchboard, too, locked out 90 percent of its workforce and hired strikebreakers. The [[Teamsters|Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago]] began a [[sympathy strike]] on June 24, 1903.  The three employers sought injunctions against the sympathy strike, which they won on July 20, 1903. The Brass Molders' strike collapsed soon afterward.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, ''The Racketeer's Progress: Chicago and the Struggle for the Modern American Economy, 1900-1940,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, ''Lawyers Against Labor: From Individual Rights to Corporate Liberalism,'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1902, the Employers' Association of Chicago was formed.  [[John G. Shedd]], vice-president of [[Marshall Field &amp; Company]], was the primary force behind the organization of the group.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Shedd became the first president. [[Montgomery Ward]] manager (later president) [[Robert J. Thorne]] was the first vice-president; grocery store president [[Frank H. Armstrong]] of [[Reid, Murdoch &amp; Company]] the second vice-president; and [[William E. Clow]], president of plumbing manufacturer [[J.B. Clow &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name="LaborWar"&gt;"Labor War in Chicago," ''New York Times,'' November 1, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal was to secure the [[open shop]], resist unionization, and break unions in workplaces where they existed.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plans"&gt;"Plans War on Teamsters," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 17, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The group kept its membership secret for fear of generating strikes by the Teamsters. By the end of the year, the EA's existence had become public knowledge and the organization had hired its first staff person, former labor arbitrator Frederick W. Job.&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Job"&gt;"Job Quits As Arbitrator," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 9, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The EA was heavily funded by the city's banks, and by other large companies such as [[Rand McNally]].&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;

The EA took its first active role in a labor dispute during the 1902-03 telephone equipment strike.  The Teamsters and team owners had formed a body known as the Chicago Board of Arbitration (CBA) in early 1903. Ostensibly, the CBA was established to mediate disputes between drivers and their employers. But the CBA quickly asserted jurisdiction over all labor disputes in the city.  The Teamsters could force employers to the table by striking, where the team owners would win decisions which enabled them to profit at the expense of other business owners.  When the CBA attempted to intervene in the telephone equipment strike, the EA retaliated.  The EA threw its entire support behind Kellogg Switchboard, which subsequently refused to bargain with the union. The EA also supplied funds and legal expertise which enabled Kellogg Switchboard to win a court injunction forcing the Teamsters to end their sympathy strike.  These actions helped break the strike.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Facing Defeat, Unions Weaken," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 18, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teamsters quickly became the biggest target of the EA.  In early 1904, the Teamsters aligned all their contracts to expire simultaneously on May 1, 1905. The EA then passed a resolution on June 16, 1904, declaring that no employer would sign a contract with the Teamsters after May 1, 1905.&lt;ref name="Plans" /&gt;

The EA's biggest anti-union push came in 1905.  On December 15, 1904, 19 clothing cutters at Montgomery Ward went on strike to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors.  The Montgomery Ward quickly locked them out.  Sympathy strikes by several tailors' unions broke out, as did sympathy strikes by other unions.  By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line.  The Teamsters engaged in a sympathy strike on April 6, 1905, adding another 10,000 members to the strike.  The EA collected $250,000 (about $6.2 million in 2007 dollars) from its members to hire [[strikebreaker]]s.  The EA also raised $1 million (about $25 million in 2007 dollars) to establish the Employers' Teaming Association-a new company which, within a matter of weeks, bought out a large number of team owners and imported hundreds of [[African American]] strikebreakers from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to drive the wagons. [[Mark Morton (businessman)|Mark Morton]], president of [[Morton Salt]] and an EA member, convinced the railroads to pressure the remaining team owners to lock out their Teamster members as well. The Teamsters upped the ante, and another 25,000 members walked off the job on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, department stores and coal companies. The EA and its members sued nearly every union as well.  Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work.  When a wagon owner refused to do business with Montgomery Ward for fear that the Teamsters would picket him, a court forced the team owner to do business with the retailer.  Few courts were impartial in their administration of justice. One judge seated a [[grand jury]] whose foreman was [[A. A. McCormick]], the reactionary publisher of the ''[[Chicago Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gigantic Strike Is In Full Swing," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 28, 1905; "Big Strike Has Small Beginning," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 20, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike ended not through the efforts of the EA or the unions, but due to the allegations of John C. Driscoll.  In June 1905, the grand jury led by foreman McCormick heard testimony by Driscoll, who at the time was secretary of the team owners' association.  Driscoll claimed that he had taken at least $10,000 in bribes from Thorne and executives at other companies to force the unions out on strike.  Driscoll also alleged that the Teamsters and other unions had demanded bribes to end the strike, and that Driscoll had skimmed portions of these bribes into his own pocket.  $50,000 in cancelled checks were produced in court to support Driscoll's claims.  Although Driscoll's testimony undercut both sides, public support for the unions suffered most. Although nearly every union continued to support the strike publicly, most sent their members back to work by the end of June.  The Teamsters continued to support the strike, but various divisions of the union also went back to work in June and July. By August 1, 1905, the strike was over and the employers ended the lockout.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Strike Leads to 49 Indictments," ''New York Times,'' July 2, 1905; "Project to End Strike," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 18, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s and 1930s==
The EA pressed its advantage against Chicago's unions.  It added building owners as members in 1913, and supported them in their fight with the [[Service Employees International Union|Building Service Employees International Union]]. It helped expose efforts to [[extortion|extort]] money from property owners in 1921, which led to the indictment and eventual imprisonment of BSEIU president [[William Quesse]].&lt;ref&gt;"Owners Leagued Against Janitors," ''Chicago Daily Tribune," December 28, 1913; "Hounded Flat Owners," ''New York Times,'' February 18, 1921; Jentz, "Unions, Cartels, and the Political Economy of American Cities: The Chicago Flat Janitors' Union in the Progressive Era and the 1920s," ''Studies in American Political Development,'' Spring 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the EA attacked nascent unions in grocery stores and food industries, accusing them of vandalism, bombings and extortion as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Terror Plot to Bomb Grocers Bared in Report," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 25, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early and mid-1920s, the EA put pressure on unions in the city's milk and ice industries, accusing unions of blackmail, extortion, and establishing [[United States antitrust law|anti-competitive trusts]] and [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Charge Labor Czars Control Citizens' Milk," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 16, 1925; "Bomb Milk Plant Which Bucks 'Trust'," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 17, 1925; "Renews Attack, Charging Trust in Selling Milk," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 18, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on illegal activities by unions proved so effective that the EA's main priority became attacking [[Racket (crime)|labor racketeering]]. The term "racketeering" was, in fact, coined by the Employers' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of [[organized crime]] in the [[Teamsters]] union.&lt;ref&gt;Witwer, "'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s," in ''Corrupt Histories,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports about rackets and other illegal activities by labor unions and employers were issued annually by the EA.  In 1928, for example, the Employers' Association claimed that exactly 46 rackets were operating in Chicago.  The EA reported on the use of thugs and gunmen by both unions and employers, and excoriated the public and government officials for not prosecuting rackets more often or more successfully.&lt;ref&gt;"46 Species of Rackets Still Active, Charge," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 6, 1928; "Gunmen Taken Into Business for Trade War," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 27, 1928; "Blames Public Laxity for Racketeering," ''New York Times,'' October 2, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; EA reports also focused on bombings in the city. These reports provide statistical documentation of the level of organized crime-related violence in the city (although the EA reports rarely distinguish between union- or employer-instigated violence and violence undertaken by mob-dominated unions or employers). The Association's October 1928 report, which documented an astonishing 727 bombings in Chicago in the previous year, led to the formation of the city's first arson unit.&lt;ref&gt;"May Ask Mayor to Form Bomb, Arson Bureau," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 26, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1928, Employers' Association president [[James W. Breen]] was linked to the rackets himself. Chicago police investigators alleged that Breen had helped form a battery makers' cartel, and that this trade group was shaking down non-members. Breen promptly resigned as president of the association.  A year later, organized crime figures bombed Breen's home for fear that the ongoing investigation might lead to Breen's indictment and that he might inform on his associates.  But Breen was never indicted, however.&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;"Breen Is Linked to New Battery Station Racket," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 27, 1928; "J.W. Breen's House Bombed," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 15, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Employers' Association made its first foray into legislative lobbying in 1928 as well.  That year, it called for repeal of the state of Illinois' "horse thief law," which permitted posses to form legally so long as they were in [[hot pursuit]] of criminals. The EA claimed that the law led citizens and employers to mistakenly believe gangs of union members were legal deputies when they were not.&lt;ref&gt;"Call Old 'Horse Thief' Law Aid to Modern Racketeers," ''Chicago Daily Tribune.,' November 11, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the Association campaigned for a new city ordinance which would ban the resale of seized weapons to the public. The sale of the guns, the EA claimed, merely put more weapons in the hands of criminals while inducing law enforcement personnel to seize the weapons of law-abiding citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Resell Weapons to Gangsters, Macoy Charges," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 22, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Employers' Association campaign against rackets remained strong through 1935.  In 1929, the EA issued a report estimating the costs of racketeering in the city of Chicago at $136 million a year (about $1.6 billion in 2007 dollars).  In August 1929, the Association reported 67 bombings in the past year, compared to 46 in 1928. The organization also posted a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any bomber, and a $1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any racketeer who assaulted an Employers' Association member. The bombing campaign only intensified, however, with another 30 bombings in August and September 1929. In 1931, the Association went public with a report which estimated the cost of bombings at $500 million ($6.8 billion in 2007 dollars), and the cost of racketeering at $145 million ($1.9 billion in 2007 dollars).  By 1932, the Employers' Association was claiming that the bombings and rackets cost the city more than the taxes it paid to fight [[World War I]]. Whether the EA's anti-racketeering campaign had any effect is unclear.  The [[Great Depression]] had caused union membership to drop significantly, and the end of [[Prohibition in the United States]] largely ended organized crime's primary motive for engaging in widespread violence.  But the EA campaign had also led to strengthened anti-racketeering laws and stronger enforcement as well.  By 1934, the number of bombings had dropped to their lowest since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;"Racketeering Costs Put at $136,000,000," ''New York Times,'' February 23, 1929; "Employers Join War on Bombers," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 4, 1929; "Bomb Campaign," ''Time,'' August 12, 1929; "97 Bombings in Ten Months, Record in City," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 7, 1929; "Rackets In Gain While Year Old Threat Grows Cold," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 14, 1930; "Chicago Pictured in Grip of Rackets," ''New York Times,'' January 18, 1931; "Finds Rackets Cost More Than War Did," ''New York Times,'' September 21, 1932; "Bombing Total in 1933 Lowest in Last 10 Years," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 16, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on federal labor policy==
The passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (the Wagner Act) in 1935 energized the Employers' Association, and drew it into a new field of activity.  Although the EA had long opposed [[collective bargaining]], federal legislation protecting labor unions took the organization by surprise.  The Association vociferously attacked [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s labor policies. But like many employers, the EA took a "wait and see" attitude until the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled on the Wagner Act's constitutionality.  The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in 1937 in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'' 301 U.S. 1 (1937). The EA rarely attacked the act for the remainder of the 1930s or during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Employers"&gt;"Employers Hear New Deal Labor Policy Attacked," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 8, 1935; "Blame Wagner Act for Labor Killings In City," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 16, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the post-war period it once more blasted unions and the federal government's labor policies. The EA undertook a campaign to influence Congressional opinion, and pushed strongly for repeal of the Wagner Act.  When repeal seemed out of reach, the EA supported the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] and the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] (LMRDA).  It also sponsored a program to take advantage of the provisions of both acts by bolstering the role foremen played in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;"Truman Labor Stand Assailed By Chicagoans," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 22, 1945; "Charges Union Groups Try to Rule Business," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 21, 1946; "Trade Groups Hail Adoption of Labor Bill," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 24, 1947; "Seek to Boost Foreman Role in Production," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 28, 1947; "Query On Labor Law Is Send to Business Men," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 18, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1930s, labor-related disruptions and violence in Chicago had been greatly reduced.  Chicago law enforcement was also cracking down heavily on labor violence and racketeering, which won high praise from the Employers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;Bromage, "Lack of Labor Trouble Helps Chicago Trade," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 9, 1938; "Commend Police Labor Detail, At Work For Year," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 9, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association became much less active in labor relations in the 1950s and 1960s.  The organization undertook a brief resurgence of interested in rackets in 1951, however.  It attacked the Chicago Retail Druggists Association for "forcing" pharmacies to pay dues to the group, accused the restaurant workers' union of extorting money from cafes, threatened to sue the Teamsters union for violations of the LMRDA, and more.  It even went so far as to hire a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, Frederick W. Turner, Jr., to investigate labor racketeering in the city.  But none of these campaigns had the impact of its 1920 efforts, and Turner's investigations produced next to nothing.  No indictments or grand jury investigations occurred, either.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Urged to 'Buy' Labor Peace, Druggists Say," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 24, 1951; Hartmann, "Boyle Probes 51 Cafe Strikes in Union Racket," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 20, 1951; Hartmann, "Employers Fight Investigator to Fight Rackets," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 3, 1951; Bliss, "Clean Up Your Union, Warning to Teamsters," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 4, 1957; "Demands Quiz on Charges of Work Ban Plot," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 19, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 1951, the EA dropped its pretense of "fair play" and announced it openly opposed unionization of every workplace. But this militaristic stand did little to revive the group.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Dealers Fight Organizing of Car Salesmen," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 22, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA tried again to focus public attention on labor racketeering in 1962.  Once more, it hired an ex-FBI agent to investigate racketeering in the city of Chicago, and accused unions of using simple picketing as a means of extortion.  But the legal and political climate had changed, and these efforts were often unsuccessful.  In November 1964, [[Chicago City Council]] [[Alderman]] Thomas E. Keane accused the EA of anti-union bias—a charge the Association roundly denied.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, "Union Peace for 25 Years Is Celebrated," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 22, 1962; "Ex-FBI Agent Takes Job In Labor Field," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 10, 1962; Bliss, "Charge Unions Picketing to Force Pacts," ''Chicago Tribune,'' August 7, 1966; "Keane Charges Are Denied By Employers Unit," ''Chicago Tribune,'' November 21, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA played a role in three more strikes, both of them affecting mechanics at auto dealerships.  In 1968, the Association acted as a spokesperson for the auto dealers in their attempt to resist unionization.&lt;ref&gt;"Auto Dealer Group Official Is Threatened," ''Chicago Tribune,'' May 14, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanics unionized, and struck the auto dealers in 1975, 1978 and 1981.  During each strike, the EA strongly and publicly supported the dealerships and continued to act as their primary spokesperson.  But the EA played little role other than that of public relations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, "Work, Pay Dispute," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 4, 1975; "Mechanic Strike Set," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 6, 1975; Strong, "Striking Mechanics to Vote Friday," ''Chicago Tribune,'' September 19, 1975; "Car Dealers to Hold Firm," ''Chicago Tribune,'' September 25, 1975; Strong, "Car-Dealer Mechanics' Contract Vote Sunday," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 1, 1978; Strong, "Mechanic, Dealer Talks Resume," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 8, 1978; Strong, "U.S. Seeks New Talks in Mechanics' Strike," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 13, 1978; "Mediator Pushes End of Mechanics Strike," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 21, 1978; "Average Here: $285,224," ''Chicago Tribune,'' May 31, 1981; Strong, "Mechanics' Strike Could Strand Cars at Dealers," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 1, 1981; Strong, "Car Dealers, Mechanics Reach Truce," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 2, 1981; "Auto Mechanics' Strike Hits Most of Dealers Here," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 11, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human resources and other initiatives, 1950-1980==
The Employers' Association had engaged in its first [[human resources]] consulting in 1918.  That year, it undertook a very successful campaign to encourage local businesses to hire middle-age managers with experience rather than discharge them.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Bureau Puts Oslerism Out of Business," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 2, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA did little in this field, however, until the 1940s.  As its anti-union campaigns flagged, the organization began to become more of a human resources consulting agency for its members.  In 1941, it released its first survey of workforce needs.  Some of its human resources educational efforts remained linked to its traditional anti-unionism, however.  In 1942, it campaigned for a longer workweek—ostensibly to meet wartime production demands, but which also violated union demands for shorter work periods.  In 1949, the group denounced fringe benefits such as health insurance, pensions, and life insurance as "unnecessary" and "unwise" and exorbitantly expensive.  It also declared unemployment insurance to be too costly and unnecessary, and demanded dismantling of public [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Predict Large Labor Need In Area," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 11, 1941; "40 Hour Week Must Be Abandoned to Win War, Civic Club Is Told," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 20, 1942; "'Fringe' Pay Rolls Amount to Millions," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 29, 1949; Hartmann, "Claims For Dole Mount As Many Jobs Go Begging," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 1, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA also became involved in broader social issues.  Its leadership, always concerned with the spread of collectivist ideals, denounced President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a socialist and demanded that Congress rein in the president's economic policies.  The organization also attacked the publishers of elementary and junior high school textbooks for allowing "[[communism|communist]]" influences.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Ask Watchdogs of Congress to 'Guard People'," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 5, 1951; "Our Enemies," ''Time,'' July 16, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time Association executive director (now president) Gordon L. Hostetter died in 1962, depriving the Employers' Association of its most active leadership.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the organization quietly worked with its members to improve their human resources capacities.  It defended employers when they were accused of racial bias in the administration of employment tests.&lt;ref&gt;"Criticize FEPC Order Banning Test On Hiring," ''Chicago Tribune,'' March 7, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; But the EA abandoned most of its anti-union programs.  The organization's membership, which had hovered at the 1,000-member mark for 60 years, remained stable.  But the Association became less and less of an important political and workplace player in Chicago.  In 1971, EA president Roland E. Fulton was elected president of the Employer Association Group of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]].  But this was the last major role the EA played in either local or national labor relations.&lt;ref name="NAM"&gt;"Employer Association Group, Chairs Since 1953," National Association of Manufacturers, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago (as the group was now known) merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association. In 1989, MIMA changed its name to become the [[Management Association of Illinois]]. The group still has about 1,000 member companies, roughly half of which are in manufacturing and half in the service sector.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, "Groups Proclaim New Era in Personnel Services," ''Chicago Tribune,'' December 6, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fawaz Mubarak Al-Hasawi''' (born 25 October 1968) is a [[Kuwait]]i businessman and was the owner and chairman of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest Football Club]].  

== Biography ==
Fawaz Mubarak Al-Hasawi is a Kuwaiti businessman who was chairman of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]] from December 2012 until May 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/fawaz-al-hasawi-has-officially-terminated-his-directorship-at-nottingham-forest/story-30346468-detail/story.html|title=Al Hasawi has officially terminated his directorship at Forest|date=2017-05-22|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, succeeding his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi. The club itself was bought in the summer of 2012 by the Al-Hasawi family.

=== Qadsia SC ===
Between 2010 and 2012, Fawaz was president of [[Qadsia SC]], one of the largest sporting clubs in Kuwait. His tenure was a successful one, with the club winning two [[Kuwaiti Premier League|Kuwait Premier League]] titles and two [[Kuwait Emir Cup|Emir Cups]] along with the [[Kuwait Federation Cup|Federation Cup]] and the [[Kuwait Super Cup|Super Cup]].&lt;ref name=Soccerway&gt;{{cite web|title=Qadsia SC Honours|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/kuwait/al-qadsia-sc/trophies/|publisher=uk.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nottingham Forest ===
On 11 July 2012, it was announced that the Al-Hasawi family had purchased [[Nottingham Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest confirm Al-Hasawi family as club's new owners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/11/nottingham-forest-al-hasawi-new-owners|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=16 January 2013|location=London|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from the estate of the late [[Nigel Doughty]].

At the time of the takeover, Forest were in a stage of considerable turmoil. The sudden death of previous chairman and benefactor Doughty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest owner Nigel Doughty died of natural causes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18017744|publisher=BBC News | date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had left the club in a position of financial uncertainty. The club had only narrowly avoided relegation to [[npower League One|League One]] and the uncertainty over the club's fortunes had led to Forest only boasting a handful of first team players. A huge overhaul was needed and the Al-Hasawi family did not hesitate to make their mark, dismissing manager [[Steve Cotterill]] quickly and replacing him with former Forest coach [[Sean O'Driscoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Graham|title=Forest chase Coppell after hiring Sean|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4439603/Nottingham-Forest-appoint-Sean-ODriscoll-and-want-Steve-Coppell-as-director-of-football.html|publisher=The Sun|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was quickly followed by a considerable number of player purchases, with the club spending more than £6m bringing in a number of signings.

On 15 December 2012, Fawaz Al-Hasawi made the decision to take over the role of chairman, succeeding his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawes|first=Mike|title=Omar Al Hasawi stands down as Forest chairman... to be replaced by cousin Fawaz|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2248809/Omar-Al-Hasawi-stands-Nottingham-Forest-chairman--replaced-cousin-Fawaz.html|publisher=Daily Mail|location=London|date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a 4–2 victory over [[Leeds United]], and with Forest firmly involved in the Championship promotion battle, Fawaz made the surprise decision to dismiss manager O'Driscoll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest owners sack manager Sean O'Driscoll|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/26/nottingham-forest-sean-odriscoll-sack|publisher=Guardian | location=London|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replace him with former [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] manager [[Alex McLeish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nursey|first=James|title=McLeish hired by Nottingham Forest to deliver a return to the Prem|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/nottingham-forests-new-manager-alex-1507985|publisher=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2013, McLeish parted ways with Forest by mutual agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11727/8473102/Nottingham-Forest-have-parted-company-with-manager-Alex-McLeish-by-mutual-agreement | title=Nottingham Forest part company with manager Alex McLeish by mutual agreement | work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Billy Davies]].

Fawaz subsequently become more involved with the press, including interviews with BBC sports journalists, and even referred to Billy Davies as a possible Forest equivalent to [[Alex Ferguson]], and spoke of Forest returning to a UEFA Champions' League level at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21918274|title=Fawaz Al Hasawi: Vast wealth fuels Nottingham Forest ambitions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this coincided with a significantly diminished relationship between the football side of the club and the media due to a series of media bans and restrictions imposed by Davies. In March 2014, following a poor run of results and a breakdown in the relationship between himself and Fawaz, Billy Davies became the fourth manager to be dismissed during the Al-Hazawi period of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26712368|title=Billy Davies: Nottingham Forest sack manager|date=24 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dismissal of Davies, it was widely reported that [[Neil Warnock]] was offered the Forest manager's position, but rejected it due to Fawaz expressing an intention to interfere with team selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26726302|title=Nottingham Forest: Neil Warnock rejects manager role|date=25 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently announced that Forest's youth team coach Gary Brazil would manage the first team until the end of the 2013/14 season, and that [[Stuart Pearce]] would take over as manager on 1 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26867437|title=Stuart Pearce: Nottingham Forest confirm Reds legend as boss|date=3 April 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fawaz has denied the reports that Warnock was offered the job, and that he interfered with football decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/05/fawaz-al-hasawi-government-nottingham-forest-championship-stuart-pearce|title=Fawaz al-Hasawi: no government behind Nottingham Forest, only me|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=5 May 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a protracted series of take-over discussions with [[John Moores (baseball)|John Jay Moores]] that failed to result in a sale of the club, Fawaz dismissed [[Philippe Montanier]] on January 14, 2017 following the 0-0 draw at Birmingham City.

The managers of Nottingham Forest during Fawaz's ownership were:

EchoLight initially shared office space with Fukunaga's [[Funimation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinstein |first1=Adam |title=Rick Santorum's Wholesome Film Studio Has a Smutty Anime Secret |url=http://gawker.com/rick-santorums-wholesome-film-studio-has-a-smutty-anim-1552802755 |website=Gawker |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=2 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703030939/http://gawker.com/rick-santorums-wholesome-film-studio-has-a-smutty-anim-1552802755 |archivedate=3 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Toei Animation told Funimation that they could not have the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. However Fukunaga's uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was one of the producers for Toei and helped Fukunaga convince Toei Animation to give the licence to Funimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atTdTl3UOzI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m33s | title=Dragon Ball Z Blu-ray Live Interview w/ Gen Fukunaga | publisher=FUNimation | date=October 6, 2011 | accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Gen went to a coworker named Daniel Cocanougher whose family owned a [[feed mill]] in [[Decatur, Texas]] and convinced the Cocanougher family to sell their business and invest in creating a production company. With that, FUNimation Productions was established in 1994.{{citation needed|date=March 2015|reason=this paragraph needs citation}}

In 2005, Funimation was acquired by the [[Navarre Corporation]] for US$100.4 million, Fukunaga still remained the company's CEO. In 2011, the company was sold to a group of investors which included Fukunaga himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-05-11/navarre-acquires-funimation Navarre Sells Funimation to Group with Gen Fukunaga]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Funimation was sold to [[Sony Pictures Television|Sony Pictures Television Networks]] for US$143 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/08/01/funimation-agrees-acquired-sony-pictures-television-networks/|title=Funimation Agrees To Be Acquired By Sony Pictures Television Networks |website=funimation.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Fukunaga is married to Cindy Brennan, who also was a co-founder and former executive producer at Funimation. They have three children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10680">'''Gold laundering''' is the process whereby illegally obtained [[gold]] is [[Melting|melted]] and [[Casting (metalworking)|recast]] into another form. The recasting is performed to obscure or conceal the true origin of the gold. The recast gold is then sold, thus laundering it into [[cash]].

It may also refer to a [[money laundering]] transaction in which the exchanged good is gold.

==Process==
There are several stages in the gold laundering process. The first is the acquisition of the gold, which may be from any combination of sources, at least one of which is illegal. This is then treated as [[scrap metal]], melted,{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}} then cast into a [[Molding (process)|mold]]. This results in a transportable [[ingot]], [[gold bar]] or other bulk form [[bullion]].

In some cases, there is no gold involved in the laundering scheme. [[Colombia]] reported 70 tons of gold exports for 2012 despite production of only 15 tons.{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}} This is a result of fictitious gold exports filed with the Colombian customs agency by [[drug cartel]]s in order to import "cash from international drug deals".{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}}

===Acquisition===
Acquisition of the gold occurs in many forms.

Small-scale [[gold mining]] operations, particularly those with no permits or licences,{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}} [[Gold extraction|extract gold]] from areas unsuitable for large [[mining]] operations. Gold obtained in this fashion that is exported may not be traced or authenticated.{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}} This includes artisanal mines operated by few individuals, who then sell the gold to brokers.{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}}
[[Image:Buchenwald Property 80623.jpg|thumb|left|300px|As Minister of Economics, [[Walther Funk]] accelerated the pace of rearmament and as [[Reichsbank]] president banked for the SS the [[gold]] [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s of [[Nazi concentration camp]] victims]]

Another form of acquisition is [[Metal theft|theft]]. In the 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] forcibly obtained the possessions of Jews, sometimes in collaboration with other parties. Most victims who died in [[death camp]]s and [[Nazi concentration camp]]s were robbed of all valuable property by the state, which was then sold or, in the case of bullion, sent to the [[Reichsbank]]. For example, in 1945 the [[Hungarian Gold Train]] was established to transport the property of Hungarian Jews to [[Berlin]]. Once the Jews had been deported to German [[concentration camp]]s, the valuables were sorted into categories such that their owners could no longer be identified.{{sfn|Art Research Staff|1999}} In the late 1930s and throughout [[World War II]], Germany would increase its unofficial gold reserves by expropriating gold from foreign governments, including $223m from [[Belgium]] and $193m from the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|UK Treasury}} Some of the [[Nazi gold]] was exchanged for cash,{{sfn|Simons|1999}} and some deposited in financial institutions, including $316 million of the looted gold at the [[Swiss National Bank]].{{sfn|Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland}} Of the nearly 100 tons of gold laundered through Swiss banks, only 4 tons was returned.{{sfn|Simons|1999}} The [[Banco de Portugal]], the [[central bank]] of [[Portugal]], would regularly purchase Nazi gold held at the Swiss National Bank, according to a 1944 document from the [[American Overseas Special Services]].{{sfn|DePalma|1997}}&lt;ref&gt;In one transaction, the Swiss National Bank instructed the [[Bank of Canada]] to transfer four tons of gold it had held there since before World War II to the [[Banco de Portugal]]. Similar transactions for 15.5 tons of gold were made with the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]].{{sfn|DePalma|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refining===
{{See also|Refining (metallurgy)|millesimal fineness}}

The scrap gold is then sold by brokers to smelters or [[Refining (metallurgy)|refiners]], who heat the gold to at least {{convert|1064|°C|°F}}, its [[melting point]].{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=182}} This may include gold from numerous sources, including recycled and newly mined gold. Once melted, it may be purified by [[Gold parting|parting]], which separates out [[silver]] impurities, and the [[Miller process]] or [[Wohlwill process]], depending on the desired level of purity and scale of operation.

Once refined, it is cast into a transportable form for further processing. [[Gold fingerprinting]], that is identifying a particular source of gold based on its impurities or trace elements, may be possible if the impurities have not been removed via refining.

==Effects==
To prevent laundering of gold and other metals (such as [[tantalum]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]), some nations have established systems and regulations. For example, [[Rwanda]] introduced regulations for mineral trade that requires all ore extraction be tagged, in part a response to the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in the [[United States]] that requires companies to disclose the use of [[conflict mineral]]s by publishing a [[supply chain]] audit.{{sfn|Manson|2013}}

However, with only 100 government monitors overseeing 450 mining sites during typical business hours, smuggling still occurs, exacerbated by corrupt monitors illegally selling tags or failing to record transactions in logbooks.{{sfn|Manson|2013}}

In 2013, [[Ghana]]ian president [[John Dramani Mahama]] announced that the [[government of Ghana]] would establish a task force to regulate the small-scale mining sector.{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}} This was to ensure that gold produced in small-scale mines could be authenticated, and also to eliminate the use of [[Heavy equipment|heavy machinery]] that had become prevalent on such sites, which have  caused [[Environmental impact of mining|environmental damage]].{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}}

The [[government of Uganda]] obtained $200 million in trade revenue from the sale of gold in 2012, but expects that to decrease in 2013 as a result of [[illegal mining]] operations.{{sfn|Jaramogi|2013}}

The group [[InSight Crime]] claims that illegal mining represents up to 30% of the revenues of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}}

On 22 November 2000, the [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks]] was settled, providing a fund of $1.25 billion for restitution to individuals whose property was confiscated by the [[Nazi]]s during World War II.

'''Hormone replacement therapy''' ('''HRT'''), also known as '''menopausal hormone therapy''' ('''MHT''') or '''postmenopausal hormone therapy''' ('''PHT''', '''PMHT'''), is a form of [[hormone therapy]] which is used to treat [[menopausal symptoms|symptoms]] associated with [[menopause]] in women.&lt;ref name="pmid26444994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20566620" /&gt; These symptoms can include [[hot flash]]es, [[vaginal atrophy]] and [[vaginal dryness|dryness]], and [[osteoporosis|bone loss]], among others, and are caused by diminished levels of [[sex hormone]]s in the menopausal period.&lt;ref name="pmid26444994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20566620" /&gt; The main [[sex-hormonal agent|hormonal medication]]s used in HRT for menopausal symptoms are [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s and [[progestogen]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt; A progestogen is usually used in combination with an estrogen in women with intact [[uterus]]es because unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer|cancer]] and progestogens prevent these risks.&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;&lt;ref name = Maturitas&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shuster | first1 = Lynne T.| last2 = Rhodes | first2 = Deborah J.| last3 = Gostout | first3 = Bobbie S.| last4 = Grossardt | first4 = Brandon R.| last5 = Rocca | first5 = Walter A.| title = Premature menopause or early menopause: Long-term health consequences | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.08.003 | journal = [[Maturitas]]| issn = 0378-5122| volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–166 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19733988| pmc =2815011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "eden"&gt;Eden, K.J., &amp; Wylie, K.R.

The 2002 [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) found disparate results for all cause mortality with HRT, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50 to 59, but higher when begun after age 60.

It is also used for health benefits, such as reduced risk of [[dementia]], [[colorectal cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]], and others. However, this may be counterbalanced by various health risks, like an increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[breast cancer]].

HRT is often given as a short-term relief (often one or two years, usually less than five) from menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes, [[irregular menstruation]]). Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menopause treatments|publisher=NHS|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/treatment/|accessdate=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger women with [[premature ovarian failure]] or [[oophorectomy|surgical menopause]] may use HRT for many years, until the age that natural menopause would be expected to occur.

[[Tibolone]] is a unique medication which has the properties of an estrogen, progestogen, and androgen all in one molecule.&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;

The medications used in menopausal HRT are available in numerous different [[pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]]s for use by a variety of different [[routes of administration]]:&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;

* [[Oral administration]] ([[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]]s, [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]s)
* [[Transdermal administration]] ([[transdermal patch|patch]]es, [[transdermal gel|gel]]s, [[cream (pharmacy)|cream]]s)
* [[Vaginal administration]] (tablets, creams, [[suppository|suppositories]], [[vaginal ring|ring]]s)
* [[Intramuscular injection|Intramuscular]] or [[subcutaneous injection]] ([[solution]]s in [[vial]]s or [[ampoule]]s)
* [[Subcutaneous implant]] ([[surgery|surgically-inserted]] pellets placed into [[adipose tissue|fat tissue]])
* Other less common routes like [[sublingual administration|sublingual]], [[buccal administration|buccal]], [[intranasal administration|intranasal]], and [[rectal administration]], as well as [[intrauterine device]]s

HRT for menopause generally provides low dosages of one or more estrogens, and usually also provides a progestogen. In women with intact [[uterus]]es, estrogens are almost always given in combination with progestogens, as long-term unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with a markedly increased risk of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt; Conversely, in women who have undergone a [[hysterectomy]] or who otherwise do not have a uterus, a progestogen is not necessarily required, and an estrogen can be used alone if preferred. There are many [[combination drug|combined formulation]]s which include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Examples include the [[conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate|combination of CEEs and MPA]] (brand name Prempro), as well as the combination of estradiol with one of various progestins such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem, Cliovelle), MPA (in Indivina), [[levonorgestrel]], [[dienogest]], and [[drospirenone]], among others.

Dosage is often varied cyclically to more closely mimic the ovarian hormone cycle, with estrogens taken daily and progestogens taken for about two weeks every month or two; a method called "cyclic HRT" or "sequentially combined HRT" (abbreviated scHRT). An alternate method, a constant dosage with both types of hormones taken daily, is called "continuous combined HRT" or ccHRT, and is a more recent innovation. [[Vaginal estrogen]] can have more effect on [[atrophic vaginitis]] with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other routes.&lt;ref name=mayo2011&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602127 Estrogen (Vaginal Route)] from Mayo Clinic / Thomson Healthcare Inc. Portions of this document last updated: Nov. 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an androgen, generally testosterone, is added to treat diminished [[libido]]. It may also treat reduced energy and help reduce osteoporosis after menopause.

====Bioidentical hormone therapy====
{{Main article|Bioidentical hormone therapy}}

[[Bioidentical hormone therapy]] (BHT) is the use of hormones that are chemically identical to those produced in a woman's body. Proponents of BHT claim that it can offer advantages over non-bioidentical or conventional hormone therapy (CHT).&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17627398" /&gt; There are two different meanings to BHT as a term and therapy, which has resulted in some confusion. While both deal with the use of bioidentical hormones, one meaning concerns the specific use of certain [[compounding|compounded]] hormone preparations, usually in conjunction with [[blood test|blood]] or [[saliva testing]] to determine, and adjust, a woman's hormone levels; whereas the other meaning simply refers to the use of bioidentical hormones in general, but most typically as approved pharmaceutical preparations.&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28509626" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28301216" /&gt; The practices associated with the first meaning are not widely accepted in clinical medicine. Compounded BHT, including custom-compounded products like BiEst (20% estradiol and 80% estriol) and TriEst (10% estradiol, 10% estrone, and 80% estriol), has not demonstrated any benefits over CHT, and presents risks of uncertain dosing, potency, and possible contamination.&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt; In addition, blood or saliva testing is of limited utility due to natural fluctuations in hormone levels, and lack of consensus for ideal dosage in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid15167316" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt; As such, the evidence and scientific literature do not support the use of compounded BHT, with or without hormone-level testing, over CHT.&lt;ref name="pmid15167316"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boothby LA, Doering PL, Kipersztok S | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review | journal = Menopause | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 356–67 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15167316 | doi = 10.1097/01.GME.0000094356.92081.EF | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17627398"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirigliano M | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review of the evidence | journal = J Womens Health (Larchmt) | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 600–31 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17627398 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2006.0311 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19072518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sites CK | title = Bioidentical hormones for menopausal therapy | journal = Womens Health (Lond) | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–71 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 19072518 | doi = 10.2217/17455057.4.2.163 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25111856"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis R, Batur P, Thacker HL | title = Risks and effectiveness of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: a case series | journal = J Womens Health (Larchmt) | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 642–8 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25111856 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2014.4770 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28509626"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = L'Hermite M | title = Custom-compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: why so popular despite potential harm?

Institutions and organizations such as the FDA have taken public stances on compounded BHT. The FDA has stated that compounded BHT is unsupported by medical evidence, and its administration is considered false and misleading by the agency. The FDA has expressed concern that unfounded claims of compounded hormones having advantages over CHT mislead women and health care professionals. The approved pharmaceutical preparations used in conventional therapy have been researched to quantify these risks and benefits, and are produced by manufacturers with stringent purity and potency standards.&lt;ref name="FDA2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116832.htm | title = FDA Takes Action Against Compounded Menopause Hormone Therapy Drugs | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] | date = 2008-01-09 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding in the United Kingdom is a regulated activity. The [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) regulates compounding performed under a Manufacturing Specials license and the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (GPhC) regulates compounding performed within a pharmacy. All testosterone prescribed in the [[United Kingdom]] is bioidentical and its use is supported by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Marketing authorization exists for male testosterone products. [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) guideline 1.4.8 states: "consider testosterone supplementation for menopausal women with low sexual desire if HRT alone is not effective". The footnote adds: "at the time of publication (November 2015), testosterone did not have a United Kingdom marketing authorisation for this indication in women. Bio-identical progesterone is used in IVF treatment and for pregnant women who are at risk of premature labour."

These recommendations have not held up with further data analysis, however. Subsequent findings released by the WHI showed that all cause mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving CEEs, those receiving estrogen and a progestogen, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the [[relative risk]] for all-cause mortality was 1.04 ([[confidence interval]] 0.88–1.22) in the CEEs-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progestogen trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rossouw | first1 = J.

However, neither the WHI nor the MWS differentiated the results for different types of progestogens used. MPA – the type most commonly used in the United States – was the only one examined by the WHI, which in its analysis and conclusions extrapolated the benefits versus risks of MPA to all progestins. This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT. In fact, primate research indicates that the side effects of MPA may be worse than those of other progestogens, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more precisely what the differences in effects are when other progestins are used versus bioidentical progesterone in HRT, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bethea CL | title = MPA: Medroxy-Progesterone Acetate Contributes to Much Poor Advice for Women | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 152 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–345 | date = Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1210/en.2010-1376 | pmc=3037166 | pmid=21252179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harman SM, Brinton EA, Cedars M, Lobo R, Manson JE, Merriam GR, Miller VM, Naftolin F, Santoro N | title = KEEPS: The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15804727 | doi=10.1080/13697130500042417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Langer RD | title = On the need to clarify and disseminate contemporary knowledge of hormone therapy initiated near menopause | journal = Climacteric | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–6 | date = August 2010 | doi = 10.3109/13697137.2010.496316 | pmid = 20540591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Studd J | title = Ten reasons to be happy about hormone replacement therapy: a guide for patients | journal = Menopause Int. | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–6 | date = March 2010 | doi = 10.1258/mi.2010.010001 | pmid = 20424287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beneficial potential of HRT was bolstered in a consensus expert opinion published by [[The Endocrine Society]], which stated that when taken during perimenopause or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios.&lt;ref name="endocrine"/&gt; The AACE released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in the appropriate clinical scenario.

Proprietary mixtures of progestins and CEEs are a commonly prescribed form of HRT. As the most common and longest-prescribed type of estrogen used in HRT, most studies of HRT involve CEEs. More recently developed forms of drug delivery include suppositories, subdermal implants, skin patches and gels. They have more local effect, lower doses, fewer side effects, and result in constant rather than cyclical serum hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser IS, Mansour D |title=Delivery systems for hormone replacement therapy |journal=Expert Opin Drug Deliv |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=191–204 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16506947 |doi=10.1517/17425247.3.2.191 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Testosterone (medication)#Women}}

Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Menopause can be divided into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.&lt;ref name= "sarrel"&gt;Sarrel, P.M. (2000). Effects of hormone replacement therapy on sexual psychophysiology and behavior in postmenopause. Journal of Women’s Health and Gender-Based Medicine, 9, 25-32&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commonly perceived that once women near the end of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt; However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance.&lt;ref name= "miller"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller M.M. |author2=Franklin K.B.J. | year = 1999 | title = Theoretical basis for the benefit of postmenopausal estrogen substitution | url = | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 587–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0531-5565(99)00032-7 |pmid=10530785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

A major complaint among postmenopausal women is decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this.&lt;ref name="ziaei"/&gt; Several hormonal changes take place during the menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

In menopausal women, sexual functioning can impact several dimensions of a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, M., Viagara, G., Caba, F., &amp; Molina, E. (2004). Sexual function, menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The European Menopause Journal, 48, 411-420. {{DOI|10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the onset of menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle.&lt;ref name="nappi"&gt;Nappi, R.E. et al., (2006). Clitoral stimulation in postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction: A pilot randomized study with hormone therapy. European Menopause Journal, 55, 288-295&lt;/ref&gt; Both age — and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies.&lt;ref name="nappi" /&gt; Therefore, it can be appropriate to make use of HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.&lt;ref name="ziaei" /&gt;

Current research that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances in two of the domains.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged they were more likely to report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction — the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez"/&gt;

The maintenance and improvement of quality of life during the menopausal period is at the core of estrogen and progestogen-based HRT.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt; Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. [[Dyspareunia]] (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT.&lt;ref name="sarrel" /&gt; It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted.&lt;ref name="sarrel" /&gt; However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone — a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties — suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt; However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt;

The goal of HRT is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estradiol and progesterone in menopause. In those with premature or surgically induced menopause, a combination HRT is often recommended, as it may also prolong life and may decrease a woman's chances of developing endometrial cancers associated with unopposed estrogen therapy, as well by decreasing the incidence of dementia.&lt;ref name="Maturitas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eden"/&gt; The main hormones involved are estrogens and progestogens. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.&lt;ref name="ziaei"/&gt;

Data from numerous studies have consistently found that HRT leads to improvements in aspects of postmenopausal sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name="ziaei" /&gt; Sexuality is a critical aspect of quality of life for the large majority of menopausal women; therefore, any features of the menopausal transition that can negatively affect a woman’s sexuality have the ability to significantly alter her quality of life. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions linked to menopause include lack of desire and low libido, both of which can be explained by changes in hormonal physiology.&lt;ref name= "eden"/&gt;

Improvements in sexual pain, [[vaginal lubrication]] and [[orgasm]] are found to be statistically different from those using HRT.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Estrogens have positive effects of mood, sexual function, target end organs, and cognitive function.

===Venous and arterial coagulation===
[[Image:Great saphenous vein thrombosis 05091312009.jpg|thumb|left|Clot in the greater [[Great saphenous vein|saphenous vein]]; oral HRT is associated with increased risk of venous clot due to increased hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent clotting factors.]]

Comparisons between orally administered pill and [[transdermal patch]] suggests that when estrogens are taken orally the risks of [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration are not subject to [[first pass metabolism]], and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent [[clotting factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Olié | first1 = V.

===Cardiovascular effects===
The impact of HRT on cardiovascular morbidity is a subject of much controversy in the medical literature. The reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with HRT, reported in observational studies, has not been subsequently confirmed in randomized clinical trials. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the WHI was not statistically significant, and only found in the oldest women, and those who started HRT late after menopause began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stramba-Badiale | first1 = M. | title = Postmenopausal hormone therapy and the risk of cardiovascular disease | doi = 10.2459/JCM.0b013e328324991c | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–309 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19430340 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in risks of [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] in the treatment arm of the study varied according to age and years since onset of menopause.

A [[Cochrane review]] came to the result that in women starting HRT less than 10 years after menopause have a lower mortality and lower rate of [[coronary heart disease]] compared to placebo or no treatment, without any strong evidence of an effect on the risk of stroke. Those starting therapy more than 10 years after menopause have little effect on mortality and coronary heart disease, but have an increased risk of stroke. Overall, however, taking the increased risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] into account, it came to the conclusion that has HRT has little if any benefit for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="BoardmanHartley2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boardman|first1=Henry MP|last2=Hartley|first2=Louise|last3=Eisinga|first3=Anne|last4=Main|first4=Caroline|last5=Roqué i Figuls|first5=Marta|last6=Bonfill Cosp|first6=Xavier|last7=Gabriel Sanchez|first7=Rafael|last8=Knight|first8=Beatrice|last9=Boardman|first9=Henry MP|title=Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women|year=2015|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002229.pub4|journal=Reviews|pmid=25754617|pages=CD002229|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adverse cardiovascular outcomes may only apply to oral dosing with CEEs and progestins in oral systemic therapy, while [[transdermal administration|transdermal]] [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] and [[estriol (medication)|estriol]] may not produce the same risks, due to the absence of anabolic effects of hepatic vitamin K dependent clotting factors.&lt;ref name="Scarabin PY, Oger E, Plu-Bureau G 2003 428–32"/&gt;

On a molecular level, HRT at the time of menopause has effects on the [[lipid profile]]. Specifically, [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] decreases, while [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[triglyceride]]s and [[lipoprotein a]] increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac contractility, coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation. At the molecular level HRT may promote [[reverse cholesterol transport]] (RCT) via the induction of [[cholesterol]] [[ABC transporters]].&lt;ref name="pmid20807164"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Darabi | first1 = M. | last2 = Rabbani | first2 = M. | last3 = Ani | first3 = M. | last4 = Zarean | first4 = E. | last5 = Panjehpour | first5 = M. | last6 = Movahedian | first6 = A. | doi = 10.3109/09513590.2010.507826 | title = Increased leukocyte ABCA1 gene expression in post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 701–705 | year = 2011 | pmid = 20807164 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endometrial effects===
[[Image:Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Endometrial tumor on histology. Most commonly, the tumor is ''in situ'' with minimal morbidity; patients still have lower all-cause [[mortality rate|mortality]] than those not on HRT.]]

While combined estrogen–progestogen supplementation has been linked to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer, the specific subtype is usually stage I, or ''in situ'', and has extremely low morbidity and mortality, and studies in American women have shown the tumor to not have propensity for growth into the myometrium or parametrial soft tissues. When seen in the context of all cause mortality, women who take estrogen and develop endometrial cancer have higher survival rates than women who do not take hormonal therapy at all, which was due to the preventive effect of HRT on hip fractures.

Unopposed estrogen can also result in [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to [[endometrial cancer]]. The extensive use of high-dose estrogens for [[birth control]] in the 1970s is thought to have resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Young, Robert |author2=Arlan F., Jr Fuller |author3=Fuller, Arlan F. |author4=Michael V.

===Neurologic effects===
According to a 2007 presentation at an [[American Academy of Neurology]] meeting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18440238 | title=Hormones may ward off dementia in women: Controversial treatment effective when taken soon after menopause| publisher=Associated Press | author=Jeff Donn | date = 2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRT taken soon after menopause may help protect against dementia, but it raises the risk of mental decline in women who do not take HRT until they are older. Dementia risk was 1% in women who started HRT early, and 1.7% in women who didn't, (i.e. women who didn't take HRT seem to have had — on average — a 70% higher [[relative risk]] of dementia than women who began HRT around the time of the beginning of menopause). This suggests that there may be a "critical period" during which time taking HRT may have benefits, but if HRT is initiated after that period, it will not have such benefits and may cause harm. This is consistent with research that HRT improves executive and attention processes in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name="pmid8909345"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt R, Fazekas F, Reinhart B, Kapeller P, Fazekas G, Offenbacher H, Eber B, Schumacher M, Freidl W | title = Estrogen replacement therapy in older women: a neuropsychological and brain MRI study | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 1307–13 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8909345}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also supported by research upon monkeys that were given ovariectomies to imitate the effect of menopause and then estrogen therapies.

For women who previously have had breast cancer, it is recommended to first consider other options for menopausal effects, such as [[bisphosphonate]]s or [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s (SERMs) for osteoporosis, [[cholesterol-lowering agent]]s and [[aspirin]] for cardiovascular disease, and [[vaginal estrogen]] for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic HRT after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If HRT is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with a progestogen may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html Management of the menopause after breast cancer] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20160407214503/https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html |date=2016-04-07 }}, from The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

===Hip fractures===
Estrogen prevents the activity of [[osteoclasts]], and improves [[bone mineral density]]. Hip fracture is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older females, and usually does not occur in the setting of [[osteoporosis]]. Estrogen is the only medical therapy that has been shown to prevent hip fractures in women that are not osteoporotic, with efficacy superior to [[bisphosphonates]] or [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplementation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Ovarian cancer===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that HRT was associated with an increased risk of [[ovarian cancer]]. The authors concluded that if this association is causal, women using HRT have about one additional case of ovarian cancer per 1,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer|title=Menopausal hormone use and ovarian cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9980|pages=1835|date=12 February 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61687-1|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61687-1/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extraction of CEEs from the urine of pregnant [[mares]] led to the marketing in 1942 of Premarin, one of the earlier forms of estrogen to be introduced.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HumansOrganization2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|author2=World Health Organization|author3=International Agency for Research on Cancer|title=Combined Estrogen-progestogen Contraceptives and Combined Estrogen-progestogen Menopausal Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGDU5xibtNgC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-832-1291-1|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time until the mid-1970s, estrogen was administered without a supplemental progestogen. Studies in the 1975 and thereafter demonstrated that in the absence of a progestogen, unopposed estrogen therapy with Premarin resulted in an 8-fold increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; After this, sales of Premarin plummeted for a few years.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; However, it was shown by the early 1980s that the addition of a progestogen to estrogen therapy could mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with intact uteruses.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; This led to the development of combined estrogen–progestogen therapy who had not undergone [[hysterectomy]], most typically with a combination of Premarin and Provera (CEEs and MPA, respectively), and in the birth of the modern concept of what is referred to as "hormone replacement therapy".&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;

The WHI trials were conducted between 1991 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined estrogen and progestin therapy was closed prematurely in 2002 by its [[Data Monitoring Committee]] (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.

===Women's Health Initiative===
Clinical medical practice changed based upon two parallel [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) studies of HRT. Prior studies were smaller, and many were of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]], placebo-controlled clinical trials of HRT in healthy women.

One portion of the parallel studies followed over 16,000 women for an average of 5.2 years, half of whom took [[placebo]], while the other half took a combination of CEEs and MPA (Prempro).

This WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial was stopped prematurely in 2002 because preliminary results suggested risks of combined CEEs and progestins exceeded their benefits. The first report on the halted WHI estrogen-plus-progestin study came out in July 2002.&lt;ref name="JAMA"/&gt;

The study reported [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] increases in rates of [[breast cancer]], [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]]s and [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]]. The study also found statistically significant decreases in rates of [[hip fracture]] and [[colorectal cancer]]. "A year after the study was stopped in 2002, an article was published indicating that estrogen plus progestin also increases the risks of dementia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|vauthors = Mazzucco AE, Santoro E, DeSoto M, Lee JH|url = http://www.center4research.org/hormone-therapy-menopause/|title = Hormone Therapy and Menopause|date = December 2010|website = National Research Center for Women and Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the study was that the HRT combination presented risks that outweighed its measured benefits. The results were almost universally reported as risks and problems associated with HRT in general, rather than with Prempro, the specific proprietary combination of CEEs and MPA studied.

After the increased clotting found in the first WHI results was reported in 2002, the number of Prempro prescriptions filled reduced by almost half. Following the WHI results, a large percentage of HRT users opted out of them, which was quickly followed by a sharp drop in breast cancer rates. The decrease in breast cancer rates has continued in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sharp Drop in Rates of Breast Cancer Holds| publisher=New York Times| author=Gina Kolata| date=2007-04-19| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6D91E3FF93AA25757C0A9619C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of women started taking alternatives to Prempro, such as compounded bioidentical hormones, though researchers have asserted that compounded hormones are not significantly different from conventional hormone therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=For a Low-Dose Hormone, Take Your Pick | publisher=New York Times| author=Roni Caryn Rabin| date = 2007-08-28| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E6D91539F93BA1575BC0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | quote = Many women seeking natural remedies have turned to compounding pharmacies, which use bioidentical hormones that are chemically synthesized but with the same molecular structure as hormones produced by a woman's body.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other portion of the parallel studies featured women who were post [[hysterectomy]] so who consequently did not need to take a progestogen when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or CEEs alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only study was not halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only study participants, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New WHI Estrogen Analysis Shows Lower Breast Ca Risk| publisher=MedPageToday | author=John Gever| date=2011-04-05| url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/OBGYN/HRT/25734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. Patients who were experiencing symptoms of the menopausal transition were excluded from the study, meaning that younger women who had only recently experienced menopause were not significantly represented. As a result, while the average age of menopause is age 51, study participants were on average 62 years of age. Demographically, the vast majority were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers.

These favorable publications emphasized the benefits and downplayed the risks of its HRT products, especially the "misconception" of the association of its products with breast cancer.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt; The publications defended unsupported cardiovascular "benefits" of its products, downplayed risks such as breast cancer, and promoted [[off-label]] and unproven uses like prevention of dementia, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[vision problems]], and [[wrinkle]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt; In addition, Wyeth emphasized negative messages against the SERM [[raloxifene]] for osteoporosis, instructed writers to stress the fact that "alternative therapies have increased in usage since the WHI even though there is little evidence that they are effective or safe...", called into question the quality and therapeutic equivalence of approved generic CEE products, and made efforts to spread the notion that the unique risks of CEEs and MPA were a class effect of all forms of menopausal HRT: "Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products."&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt;

In any case, following the publication of the WHI data in 2002, the stock prices for the pharmaceutical industry plummeted, and huge numbers of women stopped using HRT.&lt;ref name="pmid28801526"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller VM, Harman SM | title = An update on hormone therapy in postmenopausal women: mini-review for the basic scientist | journal = Am.

According to Fugh-Berman (2010), "Today, despite definitive scientific data to the contrary, many gynecologists still believe that the benefits of [HRT] outweigh the risks in asymptomatic women. This non-evidence–based perception may be the result of decades of carefully orchestrated corporate influence on medical literature."&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt; Indeed, as many as 50% of physicians have expressed skepticism to the results of large trials like the WHI and HERS.&lt;ref name="pmid21949743"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tao M, Teng Y, Shao H, Wu P, Mills EJ | title = Knowledge, perceptions and information about hormone therapy (HT) among menopausal women: a systematic review and meta-synthesis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e24661 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21949743 | pmc = 3174976 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024661 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive perceptions of many physicians of HRT in spite of large trials showing risks that potentially outweigh any benefits may be due to the efforts of pharmaceutical companies like Wyeth.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;

The '''Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales''' ('''ICAEW''') was established by [[royal charter]] in 1880.&lt;ref name=Perks16&gt;{{cite book| last=Perks | first=R. W. | year=1993 |title=Accounting and Society | publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-412-47330-2 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has over 150,000 members. Over 15,000 of these members live and work outside the UK. In 2015, 8,256 students joined ICAEW &amp;ndash; the highest ever figure. 80 of FTSE 100 (the leading UK) companies have an ICAEW Chartered Accountant on the board.

==Overview==
The Institute is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]] (CCAB), formed in 1974 by the major accountancy professional bodies in the UK and Ireland.  The fragmented nature of the accountancy profession in the UK is in part due to the absence of any legal requirement for an accountant to be a member of one of the many Institutes, as the term ''accountant'' does not have legal protection.  However, a person must belong to the ICAEW, ICAS or CAI to hold themselves out as a ''[[chartered accountant]]'' in the UK (although there are other chartered bodies of [[British qualified accountants]] whose members are likewise authorised to conduct restricted work such as [[financial audit|auditing]]).

The ICAEW has two offices in the United Kingdom; the main one is [[Chartered Accountants Hall | Chartered Accountants' Hall]] in [[Moorgate]], London and the other in [[Central Milton Keynes]], in the [[Hub:MK]] complex. It also has offices in Belgium (Europe Region), China (Greater China Region), Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (Middle East, Africa and South East Asia Region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/169318/icaew_ga/en/Home/Press_and_policy/Press_and_policy_home/ICAEW_opens_Middle_East_regional_office |title=ICAEW opens Middle East regional office |publisher= ICAEW }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=china1&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2039893/icaew-pushes-regional-expansion-china ICAEW pushes regional expansion in China], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Until the mid-nineteenth century the role of accountants in England and Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers in that accountants merely maintained records of what other business people had purchased and sold.  However, with the growth of the [[limited liability company]] and large scale manufacturing and logistic in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] a demand was created for more technically proficient accountants to deal with the increasing complexity of accounting transactions dealing with depreciation of assets, inventory valuation and the Companies legislation being introduced.

To improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, accountants in the cities of Britain formed [[professional bodies]]. The ICAEW was formed from the five of these associations that existed in England prior to its establishment by [[Royal Charter]] in May 1880.&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;

# The '''Incorporated Society of Liverpool Accountants''', formed in January 1870;&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;
# The '''Institute of Accountants in London''' was formed in November 1870,&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt; comprising 37 members under the leadership of William Quilter.  In 1871, standards for membership were established with new members having to show knowledge and aptitude through successfully passing an oral examination. Initially the London Institute restricted its membership to that city, but as other institutes were established elsewhere (for example, in [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]]) it was decided to remove this restriction and as such in 1872 it simply became known as the Institute of Accountants to reflect its new national coverage;
# The '''Manchester Institute of Accountants''', formed in February 1871;&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;
# The '''Society of Accountants in England''' (1872);&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;
# The '''Sheffield Institute of Accountants''' (1877).&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;

The headquarter of the Institute, Chartered Accountants' Hall, in the City of London, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style by [[John Belcher (architect)|John Belcher]] in 1890. It was built by [[Trollope &amp; Colls|Colls &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-btrl&amp;cid=0#0 Trollope &amp; Colls at the National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of [[Victorian Baroque architecture]]. [[William Whitfield (architect)|Sir William Whitfield]] designed the 1964–70 extension and new entrance.&lt;ref name=OI&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sir William Whitfield|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803122322799|website=Oxford Index|publisher=OUP|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the institute received a Supplemental Charter. In 1957, the ICAEW merged with the Society of Incorporated Accountants (founded in 1885 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors).&lt;ref name=Perks16/&gt;

===Recent developments===

In 2005 the ICAEW sought to merge with the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) and the [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA). However, this project proved unsuccessful, and wasted a considerable amount of money.  The Institute also announced at this time that it was considering dropping the reference to England and Wales in its title to become the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  However, this plan was also withdrawn following objections from the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]].

The Institute introduced a new syllabus in 2007. In order to make it more appealing to prospective students the mandatory examinations will become more flexible based on a modular structure. In addition to paper based assessments, there are now computer based assessments of objective test questions (multiple choice).

In 2017, ICAEW launched a new brand identity - 'A world of strong economies', with an updated logo and brand positioning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icaew.com/about-icaew/who-we-are/a-world-of-strong-economies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission to membership==
===Examinations and practical work experience===
To be admitted to membership of the ICAEW, applicants must generally complete 450 days of relevant work experience (training) and pass a series of examinations. During the training, the candidate will also need to display professional ethics and skepticism along with showing a commitment towards continuous professional development, which must be maintained even once the qualification has been obtained. This pathway is defined as the '''ACA qualification'''. It is common for accountancy employers in the UK, such as the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]], to offer the ACA as part of their training contract for new joiners.

The work experience lasts between three and five years and must be with an employer or employers approved by the Institute for training; there are more than 2,850 authorised employers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca-evolved/practical-work-experience|title=Practical work experience: overview|publisher=ICAEW|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examinations are in three stages. The certificate level consists of six modules examined via e-assessments; the professional stage consists of six written papers while the advanced stage, usually taken on the final year of training, consists of two technical integration papers and a case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca-evolved/exams|title=15 accountancy, finance and business modules|publisher=ICAEW|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814220132/http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca-evolved/exams|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the ICAEW has been offering in parallel with the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation]] (CIOT) a joint ACA/CTA route which allows tax students to achieve both prestigious qualifications in a shorter length of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tax.org.uk/students_qualifications/Joint+Programme|title=Chartered Tax Adviser and ICAEW Chartered Accountant Joint Programme|publisher=CIOT|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215133844/http://www.tax.org.uk/students_qualifications/Joint+Programme|archivedate=15 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full ACA training programme is also available in Cyprus, Greece, Malaysia, Mauritius, Romania and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]].

===Other ways to membership and affiliations===

Members of equivalent bodies in other [[European Economic Area]] countries and [[Switzerland]] may also be admitted to membership after passing an aptitude test, provided they are a citizen of an [[European Economic Area|EEA]] state or [[Switzerland]].

The Institute has mutual recognition agreements in place with:
* [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe]]
* [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[South African Institute of Chartered Accountants]]

Starting from 8 January 2010, ICAEW introduced a new "Pathways to Membership" programme whereby it offers the ACA designation on passing its Examination of Experience and sponsorship by ICAEW member or under ICAEW's ATE training environment, to members (qualified through normal examination and training route) of the following accounting institutes:

* [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA)
* [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA)
* [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA)
* [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA)
* [[CPA Australia]]
* [[Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (MICPA)

However, AICPA and MICPA members who join the ICAEW under the Pathways to Membership scheme must maintain their home body membership.

ICAEW has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with accounting bodies in overseas countries.  These bodies are The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICAB), [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI), [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan]] (ICAP) and [[Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore]] (ICPAS).  There is also a joint scheme in place to enable members of the [[Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (CICPA) 
and the [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] to qualify as ACA with ICAEW.&lt;ref name=china1/&gt;
ICAEW is an affiliate of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Members And Affiliates
 |publisher=ICAC
 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership categories==
Members have the designation ACA (Associate Chartered Accountant) or FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) after their name.&lt;ref name=Fellowship&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellowship|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/members/membership-information/fellowship|publisher=ICAEW|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellowship is intended to designate those who have achieved a higher level of professional experience. It is awarded on application, and at no additional cost, to those members who have attained at least ten years of membership and who, at the date of application, have complied with the Institute's requirements on continuing professional development in the preceding three years and have no outstanding disciplinary charges against them.&lt;ref name=Fellowship/&gt;

==Faculties==
The ICAEW has seven faculties, each run by an in-house team working together with members who are experts in their particular sector:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Join a faculty|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/join-us/join-a-faculty|publisher=ICAEW|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Audit and Assurance
# Corporate Finance
# Finance and Management
# Financial Reporting
# Financial Services
# Information Technology
# Tax

The Tax Faculty was the first to be formed in 1990; The monthly TAXline publication started in 1991, and an annual Technical
Review (now Tax Planning) was first published in October 1992. The Tax Faculty joined the [[Confédération Fiscale Européenne]] (CFE) in 2001.

==District societies==
The Institute has 25 district societies, the largest of which is the London Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) with over 31,000 members. The LSCA has often taken the lead in making proposals for change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/135562/icaew_ga/en/Home/ICAEW_worldwide/London_district_society/London_Society_of_Chartered_Accountants  |title=London Society of Chartered Accountants: history and purpose |accessdate= 2010-12-08 |author= |date= |website= |publisher= ICAEW |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icaew.com%2Findex.cfm%2Froute%2F129461%2Ficaew_ga%2Fen%2FHome%2FICAEW_worldwide%2FLondon_district_society%2Fhistory_and_purpose&amp;date=2010-12-08 |archivedate=8 December 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was instrumental in the formation of the influential [[Hundred Group]] of [[finance director]]s.

'''Sir John Charles Molteno''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCMG}} (5 June 1814 – 1 September 1886) was a soldier, businessman, champion of [[responsible government]] and the first Prime Minister of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].{{sfn|Lipschutz|Rasmussen|1989|p=151}}

== Early life ==

Born in London into a large Anglo-Italian family, Molteno emigrated to the Cape in 1831 at the age of 17, where he found work as an assistant to the public librarian in [[Cape Town]]. At the age of 23 he founded his first company, ''Molteno &amp; Co.'', a trading company that exported wine, wool and aloes to [[Mauritius]] and the [[West Indies]], and opened branches around the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Marvora: ''Molteno, memorie di famiglia''. Italy: N.p.Lecco. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, he undertook Southern Africa’s first experimental export of fruit, loading a ship with a range of fruits (necessarily dried, as no refrigeration existed yet) and sending it to Australia to test foreign markets.{{sfn|De Beer|Paterson|Olivier|2003|p=21}}

The experiment ended in disaster when his ship was wrecked in a storm - pushing Molteno close to bankruptcy.
Disposing of the remains of his mercantile businesses, he immediately bought some land in the arid [[Beaufort West|Beaufort]] area and successfully introduced [[Merino|Saxon Merino]] sheep, building up the vast [[Nelspoort, Western Cape|Nelspoort Estate]]. Among his many other business ventures, he founded the region's first bank, ''Alport &amp; Co.'' – in [[Beaufort West]].

He also returned briefly to Cape Town to marry a young woman named Maria, whom he had originally met soon after arriving in South Africa. She was the [[coloured]] daughter of a [[merchant]] colleague, and he brought her back to his estate, with a view to starting a family.{{sfn|Simons|1999|p=}}

Tragedy struck a few years later when his wife died in childbirth (along with their only child). Soon afterwards the bereaved Molteno left his estate and joined a [[Boer Commando]] that was heading for the frontier mountains to fight in the 1846 [[War of the Axe|Amatola War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aridareas.co.za/roses-s-roundup/john-moltenos-pioneering-farm-1841/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beaufortwestsa.co.za/Nelspoort.htm#molteno|title=Nelspoort History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114074259/http://www.beaufortwestsa.co.za/Nelspoort.htm|archive-date=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

=== The fight for Responsible Government ===
{{main article|Responsible Government}}
The [[Economy of the Western Cape|Cape economy]] was in a recession in the early 1860s when Molteno moved back to Cape Town, remarried and bought [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]] house (At the time an estate of orchards and vineyards, not the busy suburb that it is today).

Molteno had been elected to the Cape Colony's [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|first parliament]] in 1854, representing [[Beaufort West|Beaufort]], the first municipality in southern Africa. However, in spite of the elected parliament, executive power remained firmly in the hands of a [[Administrator of the Government|British Governor]], appointed by London, meaning that the country was run primarily according to Britain's interests, rather than southern Africa's. Molteno's experiences fighting in the frontier wars had given him a contempt for what he saw as the incompetence and injustice of British imperial rule in Southern Africa, as well as a lifelong belief in the need for efficient and locally-accountable democracy. From his first entry into parliament, he therefore began a long political battle to make the Cape's [[Executive (government)|Executive]] democratically accountable (or "responsible" as it was known), and thus to give the country a degree of independence from Britain.

Over the years his [[Responsible Government]] movement grew, and eventually dominated parliament and Cape politics. In the 1860s the autocratic British Governor [[Philip Edmond Wodehouse|Edmond Wodehouse]] made repeated attempts to dismantle the few elected bodies the Cape had, and assume direct control over the colony. Molteno led the fight against these measures, using his electoral control to cut off the Governor's budget and effectively starve his administration into compliance. After nearly a decade of struggle, the defeated Governor was recalled in 1870, amid great local celebration.
Finally in 1872, with the consent of the new Governor [[Sir Henry Barkly]], Molteno saw the decisive bill through parliament and brought the Cape Colony's government under local control for the first time.

After first offering the post to [[Saul Solomon]] and [[William Porter (attorney-general)|William Porter]], Molteno agreed to become the Cape Colony's first Prime Minister.{{sfn|Lipschutz|Rasmussen|1989|p=151}}{{sfn|Lewsen|1982|p=}}

=== The Molteno Ministry ===

[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|John Charles Molteno - 1860s]]

He was appointed Prime Minister in 1872, and in turn appointed the young [[John X. Merriman]] as his commissioner of public works (Merriman himself was later to become the 8th Prime Minister of the Cape and in that capacity continued many of Molteno's policies).

Molteno began his ministry by re-organising the state finances. One of his government's first acts was to abolish the controversial [[Hut tax|house tax]] (Act 11 of 1872). He used the new revenues from the diamond and [[Common ostrich|ostrich]] [[feather]] industries to pay off the Cape's accumulated debts and to invest heavily in infrastructure, including a telegraph system and an ambitious railway building programme. He also oversaw a revival in the agricultural sector, and began the construction of a vast irrigation system across the country. The economy recovered, as new ports and shipping services helped the surge in exports, resulting in reasonable budget surpluses by the end of his tenure. He led the (now prosperous) Cape colony in the [[Xhosa Wars|Ninth Frontier War]] when it broke out in 1877, and he strongly resisted regional factionalism – going to great lengths to heal the rifts between the [[Eastern Cape|eastern]] and [[Western Cape|western]] halves of the Cape and blocking attempts by his political opponents to racially segregate the armed forces.&lt;br&gt; His government also founded the [[University of South Africa|University of the Cape of Good Hope]], now one of the world's [[Mega university|mega-universities]] with over 200,000 students, and Victoria College (later to become [[Stellenbosch University]]). In 1874 he established a system of government grants to build libraries in towns and villages across the country. Later known as the "[[Molteno Regulations]]", they were an immense success and were later adopted by neighbouring countries.

The Molteno Ministry was characterised by its stout opposition to imperial interference in Cape affairs, for example, quashing a bid to forcefully incorporate [[Griqualand West]] and opposing Frere's later deployment of imperial troops against the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]].{{sfn|Lipschutz|Rasmussen|1989|p=151}}

Importantly, the system of [[responsible government]] as instituted under Molteno retained the traditional Cape system of [[Cape Qualified Franchise|non-racial franchise]] – whereby all races could vote, quite unlike the situation in the rest of Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Calitz: ''Die Molteno Administrasie aan die Kaap''. SU. Suid Afrika. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confederation and War ===

[[File:The Cape Colony - 1878.jpg|thumb|The Cape Colony in 1878, on the eve of the Confederation Wars.]]

A change of government in London led to a pro-imperialist lobby headed by Secretary of State, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], determined to bring all of southern Africa into the [[British Empire]] by enforcing a confederation onto the region. This "new and impatient imperialism"{{sfn|Macmillan|1970|p=259}} was resisted by the states of southern Africa, including the Cape colony government, and relations between the Molteno government and the British Colonial Office deteriorated.

Molteno himself argued that ''"the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside."''&lt;ref&gt;Theal, George McCall: ''Progress of South Africa in the century''. Toronto:The Linscott Publishing Company. 1902. pp. 402-3.&lt;/ref&gt; – and that the whole scheme was particularly badly timed. The different states of southern Africa were still simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion, and he stressed that the forced imposition of a lop-sided confederation would cause immense instability.
Molteno's government also transmitted to London its concern that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape's Black citizens; if there was to be any form of union, the Cape's [[non-racialism]] would need to be imposed on the Boer republics, and could not be compromised.{{sfn|Mostert|1992|p=1247}}

However, the Colonial Office went ahead and dismissed governor [[Henry Barkly]] and appointed [[Henry Bartle Frere]] who on 3 February 1878 dissolved the Cape government. Frere was a formidable administrator of the British Empire but had scant experience of southern Africa and the confederation scheme soon fell apart, leaving a trail of wars across the region as predicted, including long-running conflicts with the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Pedi people|Pedi]] and [[Basotho]] nations. After the disastrous [[Anglo-Zulu War|British invasion of Zululand]] and rising discontent in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] (that later exploded as the [[First Boer War]]), Frere was recalled to London to face charges of misconduct in 1880.

=== Later political career and legacy ===

Molteno was repeatedly asked to form a government again, however (by now in his late sixties) he declined and chose to retire from public life to spend time with his family. He directed the appointment of [[Thomas Charles Scanlen]] instead, and  his last office was a brief stint advising the Scanlen Ministry as [[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Colonial Secretary]] before he retired completely.

His legacy was in the system of responsible government and parliamentary accountability that he established. Molteno did not refer to himself as a [[Social liberalism|liberal]], preferring to see himself simply as a pragmatist. However, as an early proponent of [[Universal suffrage|multi-racial democracy]], he was very influential on the later Cape Liberal tradition.

He was knighted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1882. (It was not an honour that he greatly valued however, and he had already refused three previous knighthoods earlier in his career.)&lt;ref&gt;"Centenary of Sir John Molteno". (4 September 1886). ''The Lantern''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and family ==

In person, Molteno was described as straight-talking and good-natured, with an easy laugh and a mischievous smile; politically outspoken and vigilant.{{sfn|Murray|1965|p=}}
His strongest political opponents on the other hand, accused him of being fierce, stubborn, and too much influenced by [[Saul Solomon]] (a [[Liberalism|liberal]] MP whom Molteno held in high regard).  In [[John de Villiers, 1st Baron de Villiers|Lord De Villiers]]’s biography he is summed up as ''"a fighter, who did not mind hard knocks, as long as he could return them."''{{sfn|Walker|1925|p=41, 399}}

Molteno was unusually tall and powerfully built. In Southern Africa he acquired the nickname the "Lion of Beaufort", though his British opponents reputedly referred to him in private as the "Beaufort Boer". The nicknames were both reportedly due to his deep booming voice, his height, and the large beard he grew in later life.{{sfn|Malherbe|1971|p=100}} The [[Dictionary of National Biography]] adds ''"Sir John Molteno was a man of commanding presence and great physical strength. In private life, he was of most simple and unostentatious habits."''{{sfn|Atlay|1901|p=182}}

Molteno was married three times and had a total of nineteen children, founding a large and influential South African family. His immediate descendents included politicians and members of parliament, shipping magnates and exporters, military leaders, suffragists and anti-Apartheid activists.

Although born and raised a Catholic, Molteno was tight-lipped on the subject of his religious beliefs, unusual for a man known to be frank and direct. According to his [[Percy Molteno|son and biographer]], he disliked denominations and was a [[Freethought|freethinker]].

The "Lion of Beaufort" died on 1 September 1886 and was interred at St Saviour's in [[Claremont, Cape Town]].

The town of [[Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno]], in the [[Stormberg Mountains]] of South Africa, is named after him.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Leonid Borisovich Nevzlin''' ({{lang-ru|Леонид Борисович Невзлин}}; {{lang-he|לאוניד בוריסוביץ' נבזלין}}, born 21 September 1959) is a [[Russia]]n-born [[Israel]]i businessman and philanthropist.

Nevzlin occupied various high-ranking positions at [[Group Menatep]] and its subsidiary, the [[Yukos Oil Company]]. In 2003, the Russia expropriated Yukos and began a campaign of persecution against its executives. In 2014, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled in favor of Nevzlin and other Yukos shareholders, calling the actions of the Russian state “a ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos” and expropriate its assets.

==Professional career==
From 1981-87, Nevzlin was a software engineer at Zarubezhgeologia, an external trade organization of the Soviet Ministry of Geology. In 1987, he met [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and became a Deputy Director at the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity for Youth (MENATEP), attached to the Komsomol committee in Moscow's [[Frunzensky District, Moscow|Frunzensky District]].&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14159507 |title=Невзлин, Леонид |website=Lenta.ru |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MENATEP established one of the first private banks in Russia, Bank Menatep. From 1989 to 1991, Nevzlin served as president of the bank, after which he held other high-ranking positions, including Vice Chairman of the Board (1993-1996) and Head of Public Relations (1994-1996). Nevzlin also worked at Group Menatep, focusing on corporate communications, government relations, and human resources. In April 1996 he became Vice President of Yukos, in which Menatep had acquired a 78% share in December 1995.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;

From September 1997 to October 1998, Nevzlin served as first deputy director general of the Russian news agency ITAR TASS, creating a plan to gradually transform it into a joint-stock company.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt; In April 1998 Nevzlin became First Vice Chairman of Bank Menatep. In 1999 he became First Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Yukos.&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt; From November 2001 to March 2003, he represented the [[Republic of Mordovia]] as a senator in the [[Federation Council of Russia]]. From June to November 2003, he served as the Rector of the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]]. In 2003 and 2004, Nevzlin was featured on Forbes magazine's list of the world’s 100 wealthiest people. In 2010 his wealth was estimated at US$1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

Nevzlin is a co-owner and board member of Haaretz, one of Israel’s liberal newspapers, having purchased a 20% stake in the company in 2011 for 140 million shekels. Members of the Schocken family, descendants of the newspaper’s founders, retain a 60 percent stake in the company.&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt; In 2014, Nevzlin founded the monthly Hebrew-language magazine “Liberal,” which publishes analyses of Israeli political life, communications and culture. The inaugural issue appeared in May 2014.&lt;ref name="Reuters2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Megan |date=29 July 2014 |title=Nevzlin not likely to back down in Yukos fight with Russia |newspaper=Reuters |location=Moscow and Tel Aviv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal disputes===
In 2003, following prolonged clashes with the Kremlin, Yukos’ controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and another senior executive, [[Platon Lebedev]], were arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Both were convicted in 2005 following trials that were widely condemned internationally as procedurally flawed and politically motivated.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="International1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Buckley |first=Neil |date=19 December 2014 |title=Lunch with the FT: Mikhail Khodorkovsk |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unfair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno |date=25 July 2013 |title=Mikhail Khodorkovsky trial was 'unfair' but not political, rules European court |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10202131/Mikhail-Khodorkovsky-trial-was-unfair-but-not-political-rules-European-court.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=United Kingdom |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khodorkovsky was found guilty and the sentence for tax evasion and fraud was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights for the same affair. Yukos’ assets were subsequently awarded to state-owned companies in a series of forced auctions. Yukos was declared bankrupt in August 2006.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ram |first=Vidya |date=1 August 2008 |title=Leonid Nevzlin: The One Who Got Away |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/01/nevzlin-khodorkovsky-yukos-face-cx_vr_0801autofacescan01.html |newspaper=Forbes |location=New York, New York |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevzlin left Russia for Israel in 2003. In 2004 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office sought Nevzlin’s extradition over hotly disputed criminal allegations against him related to his tenure at Yukos. The Israeli government rejected the extradition request due to insufficient evidence. Two members of the public who felt aggrieved by the government’s decision sued to have it reversed. They also petitioned the interior minister to revoke Nevzlin’s Israeli citizenship on the grounds that it was obtained under false pretenses. Nevzlin’s attorney, [[David Libai]], argued that the charges against him were the result of political persecution. A spokesman for Nevzlin stated in reaction to extradition request, "Amnesty International, the European Parliament, and the court in the UK, are only some of the bodies that have found that Russian president Vladimir Putin is persecuting Mikhail Khodorovsky, Leonid Nevzlin, and the other shareholders in Yukos, who dared to support democratic opposition parties and openly come out against him. Putin does not hesitate to make use of the Russian authorities that are subordinate to him to create false charges - in the best tradition of the KGB, in which Putin grew up."&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite news |last=Benaroia |first=Amit |date=15 May 2008 |title=Nevzlin beats extradition |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/nevzlin-beats-extradition-1.245914 |newspaper=Haaretz |location=Israel |accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt;

In May 2008 Israel’s Supreme Court found there was no evidence directly connecting Nevzlin to the criminal allegations made against him. The court rejected extradition and denied the motion to strip Nevzlin of his citizenship. Israel's interior minister and attorney general were ordered to pay Nevzlin’s court costs for this case.&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt; Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murder&lt;ref name=komm.sud&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1109205 Верховный суд признал пожизненное заключение для Леонида Невзлина законным] // [[Коммерсантъ-Online]], 27 января 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909001040/http://www.rosbalt.ru/2008/08/01/509409.html Невзлина признали убийцей] // [[Росбалт]], 1 августа 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interkavkaz.eu/reportages/nevzlin-nakanune-hodorkovskogo Невзлин накануне Ходорковского] // 17 декабря 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to life imprisonment. Nevzlin called the court case a show trial orchestrated by Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;

In 2014, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in The Hague, despite the Russian Duma having never ratified the treaty under which this judgment has been made therefore making a non-legally binding judgment, ruled unanimously that the Russian authorities had conducted a “ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate Mr. [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.” According to the panel, the forced auction of core parts of the company through contested bankruptcy proceedings “was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the State to acquire Yukos’ most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos…. In short, it was in effect a devious and calculated expropriation.”{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

The former Yukos shareholders were awarded damages totaling $50 billion – the largest arbitration award in history. As the biggest shareholder of GML, the former Yukos holding company that brought the legal case, with a 70 per cent stake, Nevzlin stands to be the biggest single beneficiary from The Hague’s ruling. The Russian government failed to meet the deadline of January 15, 2015, for paying that award. Earlier news reports indicated that the former Yukos investors would seek redress by asking U.S. and EU courts to seize Russian-owned assets on their territory.&lt;ref name="WSJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Tova |date=28 July 2014 |title=Nevzlin 'very pleased' with Hague court ruling on Yukos |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/uk-russia-yukos-nevzlin-idUKKBN0FX0SV20140728 |newspaper=Reuters |location=Tel Aviv |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public affairs and philanthropy==
Nevzlin was awarded the Order of Friendship, one of the Russian Federation’s highest honors, for his efforts in supporting Boris Yeltsin’s reelection campaign in 1996.&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;

From March to December 2001 Nevzlin served as president of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]]. He was a key player in Jewish historical and heritage research projects, including the establishment of the Moscow Jewish Cultural Center and the International Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewish Studies in Moscow. Moreover, Nevzlin contributed to numerous other Jewish educational programs developed in collaboration with [[World ORT]], the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] and the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]].&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

Since moving to Israel, Nevzlin has established the NADAV Foundation, which supports projects in Jewish studies and education, Israel-Diaspora relations and Jewish peoplehood. Its annual “NADAV Peoplehood Prize” has been awarded to such figures as author [[Elie Wiesel]], retired Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Aharon Barak]], and, most recently, Rabbi [[David Stav]], an Israeli Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=224627 |title=Jerusalem Post - Breaking News |publisher=Jpost |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadavfund.org.il/projects |title=Projects |publisher=Nadav fund |accessdate=2013-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125002925/http://www.nadavfund.org.il/projects |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2"/&gt;

Nevzlin created the Leonid Nevzlin Research Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewry at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. He has also served on the boards of both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.&lt;ref name="Charity1"/&gt;

In collaboration with the Israeli government, Nevzlin created a relief fund in 2004 to revive [[Beit Hatfutsot]] – the Museum of the Jewish People, located on the campus of Tel Aviv University, and was elected Chairman of its International Board of Governors. The NADAV Foundation launched the International School for Jewish Peoplehood Studies at Beit Hatfutsot in 2006, and the Nevzlin Center for Jewish Peoplehood at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in 2010.&lt;ref name="Charity1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cashman |first=Greer Fay |date=8 October 2013 |title=The Grapevine: 20th Anniversary! |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/The-Grapevine-20th-Anniversary-328188 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |location=Jerusalem, Israel |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevzlin has served on the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Board of Trustees of [[Keren Hayesod]], the [[United Israel Appeal]], and as Associate Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[Jewish People Policy Planning Institute]].

Nevzlin is also a long-term supporter of Israeli healthcare charity Ezra Lemarpeh.&lt;ref name="Globes"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=הרשת החברתית: בת-ים בדרך להפוך לריביירה של ישראל |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000988196|newspaper=גלובס |location=Israel|date=23 November 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==
Nevzlin was born in Moscow on 21 September 1959 into a family of [[Belarusian Jews|Belarusian-Jewish]] origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://charter97.org/ru/news/2018/8/7/300554/ |title=Леонид Невзлин: Я много встречал в мире выходцев из Беларуси |publisher=[[Charter'97]] |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He graduated from the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas in 1981, and earned an MA from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, majoring in management and marketing. Nevzlin has married three times and has five children including [[Irina Nevzlin]], chair of the board of Directors at [[Beit Hatfutsot]].&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt;&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Семейство Невзлиных в Израиле разрастается |url=http://izrus.co.il/oligarhi/article/2012-01-18/16753.html |newspaper=Izrus |location=Israel |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Irina, he is the father in law of Israeli politician [[Yuli-Yoel Edelstein]].

In 2014, Nevzlin acquired an apartment in the new, upscale Waldorf-Astoria hotel/apartment complex in the center of Jerusalem at a cost of 40 million shekels (approximately US$11.5 million).&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bousso |first=Nimrod |date=27 June 2014 |title=Israel’s priciest homes: NIS 120 million for a shore thing |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/real-estate/.premium-1.601605 |newspaper=Haaretz |location=Israel |access-date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Made in JLM set out to create "International [[Firgun]] Day", a holiday celebrated yearly on [[July 17]], where people share compliments or express genuine pride in the accomplishment of others on social media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/made-in-jerusalem/firgun-an-optimistic-little-word-42e862233e0c Firgun: An optimistic little word].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aslan-Levy, Eylon.

'''Micro enterprise tax in Latvia''' — it is special tax regime. The law, regulating the tax, entered into force on 1-st, September, 2010 and name of the law is The law on micro enterprises tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=215302 The law on micro enterprises tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim of the tax ==

Initially the tax was introduced with the aim to:
* facilitate the creation of new small businesses, 
* reduce bureaucracy and costs associated with starting a business, and
* facilitate the transition of business from the shadow (gray) market to the legal (white) market.

During that time (2009-2011) Latvia was struggling with the crisis, the unemployment rate was relatively high. The introduction of the tax on micro enterprises and other changes in legislation gave opportunity for enterprising people (including the unemployed) relatively simply and at low cost to start a business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/news/comment/comment/agnese-bicevska-mikrouznemuma-nodoklis-vai-mazs-cinitis-gazis-lielo-vezumu.d?id=38812939 Article of Agnese Bičevska about micro enterprise tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

But fairly quickly, many companies have begun to use this regime to reduce their taxes. So [[Saeima|Latvian parliament]] adopted legislation amendments. According to the amendments the application of this tax is very limited. 
Starting from 2016 application of the tax gradually decreases and from 1 January 2019 enterprises operating in most sectors (industries), will not be able to use the tax regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.company-taxes.info/related-information/changes-of-law-on-micro-enterprises-tax Changes of the Law on micro-enterprises tax.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to become a payer of the micro enterprises tax? ==
The following persons has rights to start a payer of the tax:
* a sole trader,
* an individual enterprise,
* agricultural or fishery enterprise,
* natural (private) person, that has registered economic activities with the State revenue service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://vid.gov.lv/?hl=2 State revenue service]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a limited liability company.

To become a payer of micro enterprises tax also must meet all the following criteria:
* all shareholders (if any) must be natural persons (owner of the shares of OOO automatically becomes an employee of the Company),
* turnover (income from economic activities) must not exceed EUR 100 000 per year,
* the number of employees must not exceed five employees,
* members of the board directors are employees of the company,
* natural or legal person is not a partner in a personal society,
* amount of salary of each employee does not exceed 720 euro per month,
* a person conducts business in certain (allowed) industries (enters into force on 1 January 2017).

List of sectors (industries) to which has no right to apply the regime of the micro-enterprise &lt;ref&gt;[http://m.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=277258 Regulation of the Cabinet of ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person owns shares in several companies, then only one company has the right to become a payer of micro enterprise tax.

If a person meets the above requirements, then to become a tax payer, must submit special application to the State Revenue Service. The application can be submitted using the Electronic declaration system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eds.vid.gov.lv/login/ Electronic declaration system in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Micro enterprise tax rate ==
For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 9% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 9%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 12%.

Starting from 2017, the tax rate changes.

For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 15% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 15%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 18%.

Additionally, the company must pay an additional tax - State Social Insurance Mandatory Contributions.

The index is maintained by the [[New York Stock Exchange]], but includes stocks that trade on exchanges other than the NYSE. Companies from different industries that produce or deploy innovative technologies to conduct their business are considered for inclusion. Leading companies are selected from several industries, including computer hardware, software, semiconductors, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace and defense, health care equipment, and biotechnology. 

Modeled as a multi-industry technology index, the objective of the NYSE Arca Tech 100 Index is to provide a benchmark for measuring the performance of companies using technology innovation across a broad spectrum of industries. 

Unlike other indexes, whose historic returns date back only a few months or years, the NYSE Arca Tech 100 Index has been tracked since 1982, when it was initiated by the [[Pacific Exchange]]. It is one of the oldest technology indexes calculated.

A '''negotiable instrument''' is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, with the payer usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a [[contract]], which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country and context it is used in.

==Definition==
In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]] in the UK, [[Bills of Exchange Act 1908]] in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|boea1909148|Bills of Exchange Act 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]] in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. The Bills of Exchange Act:
# defines a bill of exchange as:  'an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer.
# defines a cheque as: 'a bill of exchange drawn on (behalf of) a banker, which is payable on demand (by banker)'
# defines a promissory note as: 'an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.'

Additionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.

== History ==
The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as ''praescriptiones'' in the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=    Caesar and Christ : a history of Roman civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to A.D. 325|series=The story of civilization|volume=3|year=1944|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,000-year-old Roman [[promissory note]]s have been found&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in [[China]], where special instruments called ''feitsyan'' were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UBDndXgNIYC&amp;pg=PA50 |last=Moshenskyi  |first=Sergii |title= History of the Weksel |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-4363-0693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition= 1st Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-13th century, the [[Ilkhanid]] rulers of [[Persia]] printed the "cha" or "chap" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the "cha" only at progressive discount.

Later, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange ("[[suftadja]]" or "[[softa]]") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver [[Commodity money|specie]], in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]], [https://archive.org/stream/historicalchrono01ande#page/208/mode/2up An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts to the present time. Containing, an history of the great commercial interests of the British empire...], Vol. I, p.209–210 (1764)&lt;/ref&gt; English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bill of Exchange|volume=3|pages=940-943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]].&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Germanic [[Lombards]] documents may also have some elements of negotiability.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacob J. Rabinowitz|title=The Origin of the Negotiable Promissory Note|journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]|date=May 1956|volume=104|issue=7|pages=927–939|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7488&amp;context=penn_law_review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguished from other types of contracts ==
[[File:British Foreign Bill stamps on 1870 Oriental Bank Corporation Bill of Exchange.jpg|thumbnail|right|An 1870 Bill of Exchange payable in London with British ''Foreign Bill'' [[revenue stamp]]s attached.]]
A negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a [[contract]], albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite [[offer and acceptance]] and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a ''holder in due course'', the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a "[[bearer instrument]]", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid ''endorsement'' of the negotiable instrument.

The consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable [[statute of frauds]] as to that contract.

=== The holder in due course ===
The rights of a [[holder in due course]] of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to [[Set-off (law)|set-off]], and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque)
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument "counts" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)

Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery ([[order instrument]]s), or by delivery alone ([[bearer instrument]]s).

== Classes ==
Promissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments.

=== Promissory note ===
Although possibly non-negotiable, a [[promissory note]] may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the ''payee'', or at fixed or determinable future time, certain in money, to order or to bearer. (see Sec. 194){{clarify|date=August 2016}} The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.

[[Bank notes]] are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]], "a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Bill of exchange ===
A bill of exchange or "draft" is a written order by the ''[[wiktionary:drawer|drawer]]'' to the ''[[wiktionary:drawee|drawee]]'' to pay money to the ''[[wiktionary:payee|payee]]''. A common type of bill of exchange is the [[cheque]] (''check'' in [[American English]]), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.
[[File:Credit1.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Bill of exchange, 1933]]
A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.
A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The "holder in due course" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.
In some cases a bill is marked "not negotiable"—see [[crossing of cheques]]. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.

== In the United States ==
{{Template:Globalize/English|section|date=September 2018}}
In the [[United States]], Articles 3 and 4 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|state law enactments]] of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a ''negotiable instrument'':

{{quote|'''§ 3–104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.
(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain
(i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment,
(ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or
(iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.
(b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.
(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.
(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-104 |title=Uniform Commercial Code – Article 3 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following requirements must be met:
# The promise or order to pay must be unconditional;
# The payment must be a specific sum of money, although [[interest (finance)|interest]] may be added to the sum;
# The payment must be made on demand or at a definite time;
# The instrument must not require the person promising payment to perform any act other than paying the money specified;
# The instrument must be payable to bearer or to order.
The latter requirement is referred to as the "words of negotiability": a writing which does not contain the words "to the order of" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in [[allonge]]) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a [[bank]]) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads "pay John Doe") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.

UCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com/articles-of-the-ucc/#sthash.s8ZqcyK4.dpuf |title=Articles of the Uniform Commercial Code |publisher=Uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation and endorsement {{anchor|endorsement}}===
Persons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by placing one's [[signature]] on the instrument ("endorsement"): if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an ''endorsement''. There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-204 Article 3, Sections 204–206]:
*An endorsement which purports to transfer the instrument to a specified person is a ''special endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy";
*An endorsement by the payee or holder which does not contain any additional notation (thus purporting to make the instrument payable to bearer) is an ''endorsement in blank'' or ''[[blank endorsement]];''
*An endorsement which purports to require that the funds be applied in a certain manner (e.g. "{{visible anchor|for deposit only}}", "for collection") is a ''restrictive endorsement''; and,
*An endorsement purporting to disclaim retroactive liability is called a ''qualified endorsement'' (through the inscription of the words "without recourse" as part of the endorsement on the instrument or in [[allonge]] to the instrument).
*An endorsement purporting to add terms and conditions is called a ''conditional endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy, if she rakes my lawn next Thursday November 15th, 2007". The UCC states that these conditions may be disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-206 |title=Article 3, Sections 206(b) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument
#in [[good faith]];
#for [[Value (economics)|value]];
#without notice of any [[defense (legal)|defense]]s to payment,
the transferee is a ''[[holder in due course]]'' and can enforce the instrument ''without'' being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain ''real defenses''. These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.
The ''holder-in-due-course rule'' is a ''rebuttable presumption'' that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate ''real defenses'' available to purported holders in due course.
The foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to [[lawsuit|litigation]] to recover on the instrument.

=== Usage ===
While bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of [[commercial paper]] with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.

Alternatively, an individual or company may write a [[cheque|check]] payable to "cash" or "bearer" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.

=== Exceptions ===
Under the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:
* [[Bill of lading|Bills of lading]] and other documents of title, which are governed by Article 7 of the Code.  However, under [[admiralty law]], a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or 'order' bill of lading or a nonnegotiable or 'straight' bill of lading.
* [[Deed]]s and other documents conveying interests in real estate, although a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] may secure a promissory note which is governed by Article 3
* [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s
* [[Letters of credit]], which are governed by Article 5 of the Code

== Modern relevance ==
Although often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;Mann RJ (1996). [http://www.columbia.edu/~mr2651/Data/SearchforNegotiability.pdf Searching for Negotiability in Payment and Credit Systems]. ''UCLA Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], when [[money]] and [[market liquidity|liquidity]] was relatively scarce.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; The [[holder in due course]] rule has been limited by various statutes.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Concerns have also been raised that the [[holder in due course]] rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.&lt;ref name=Greenlee&gt;Greenlee MB, Fitzpatrck IV TJ.

Marshall started working with AdWords in 2002 soon after it was first introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468816381|title=Google AdWords for dummies|last=Howie.|first=Jacobson,|date=2009|publisher=Wiley Pub|year=|isbn=9781118051726|edition= 2nd|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=150|oclc=468816381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released ''Guerrilla Marketing for Hi-Tech Sales People'', in which he likened the use of AdWords and emerging [[social media]] to the graffiti and flash mobs of [[Jay Conrad Levinson]]'s [[guerrilla marketing]] - economical attention-getting that created a grassroots customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.amazon.com/Guerilla-Marketing-Hi-Tech-Sales-People/dp/B004U1A5P0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511219277|title=Guerilla Marketing for Hi-Tech Sales People - 21 Secrets of High-Impact, Low Cost Marketing|date=2002|people=Marshall, Perry|access-date=November 20, 2017|medium=Audio CD}}&lt;/ref&gt; He consulted and wrote on the strategy of customers finding their vendors using the newly developing [[search advertising]]; "when the customer finds you, instead of you finding the customer, his or her perception of you is different."&lt;ref name="Mark022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perrymarshall.com/marketing/m02/|title=Marketing 02|last=Marshall|first=Perry|publisher=Perry Marshall &amp; Associates|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPClick2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021003965_2.html|title=Perry|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=February 1, 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=12 July 2013|author2=Bryan Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He documented the process and released the ''Definitive Guide to Google AdWords''.&lt;ref name="SMSInterview3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/interview-with-search-engine-marketing-expert-perry-marshall|title=Interview With Search Engine Marketing Expert Perry Marshall|last=Milyan|first=Andrey|date=Summer 2006|publisher=Search Marketing Standard|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords'' followed in 2007;&lt;ref name="adwordsfordummies3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Google_AdWords_For_Dummies.html?id=9_2TzakSYwcC|title=Google AdWords for dummies|last=Jacobson|first=Howie|author2=McDonald, Kristie|author3=McDonald, Joel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=1118115619|edition= 3rd|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=277–278, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Split testing ===
Starting with his first book on the subject, Marshall advocated AdWords [[A/B testing|split testing]] for [[market research]] and captured a set of guidelines for using split testing around types of ad copy and page positions that included precise wording.&lt;ref name="SMSInterview3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adwordsfordummies3"/&gt;{{rp|289}} He coined the term "AdWords [[stupidity tax]]" for the premium Google charged on broad matching of search items.&lt;ref name="Successsecrets2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Success secrets of the online marketing superstars|last=Meyerson|first=Mitch|publisher=Dearborn Trade Pub.|year=2005|isbn=1419505017|location=Chicago|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mastering2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mastering_the_World_of_Marketing.html?id=y-PO1yBSmhAC|title=Mastering the world of marketing : the ultimate training resource from the biggest names in marketing|last=Riklan|first=Eric Taylor, David|date=2011-05-04|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0470888415|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facebook marketing and 80/20 ===
In 2011, Marshall published ''Ultimate guide to Facebook advertising'', in which he focused on guerrilla marketing techniques to social media.&lt;ref name=ENTFacebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Perry|title=How Facebook Tools Can Revitalize Ad Campaigns|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224186|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=Entrepreneur Magazine|date=September 25, 2012|author2=Thomas Meloche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he was a featured consultant on [[The Next Internet Millionaire]], a [[reality show]] hosted by [[Joel Comm]]. Marshall spoke with the contestants on [[Richard Koch|Richard Koch's]] [[80/20 rule]] as it applied to internet advertising and his philosophy of investing in grassroots marketing.&lt;ref name="Luchuck"&gt;{{cite book|title=From cubicle slave to the next Internet millionaire|last=Comm|first=Jaime Luchuck ; forward by Joel|publisher=Madeeasy Pub.|year=2008|isbn=1600373720|location=New York|pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this philosophy in his 2013 book, ''80/20 Sales and Marketing'', where he discussed the rule as a possible truism across several economic bands .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=80/20 Sales and Marketing|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=August 2013|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=1599185059|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reviewed in the Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fox/sell-more-by-achieving-go_b_3741007.html|title=Sell More By Achieving 'Good Enough'|last=Fox|first=John|date=2013-08-12|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Inc.com reviewed it as one of the "5 Best Sales Books of 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/the-5-best-sales-books-of-2013.html|title=5 Best Sales Books of 2013|date=10 December 2013|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall wrote about the notion of 80/20 as a fractal [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-koch/can-fractal-8020-tap-insa_b_7016478.html phenomenon] which informs pricing strategy. Leonard Kim of INC Magazine summarizes: “Within every 80/20, there is another 80/20 inside of that, then another 80/20 inside that...4% of your customers will generate 64% of your revenues; 1% of your customers will generate 50% of your revenues; 0.2% of your customers will generate 40% of your [https://www.inc.com/leonard-kim/youre-losing-money-if-you-arent-following-this-pricing-strategy.html revenues].”

=== Evolution ===
Marshall is the author of ''Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design'', a text in which he discusses his support for [[evolutionary creation]]. In addition he has delivered lectures on the topic, for example, at a conference of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]].&lt;ref name="ASA2015" /&gt;  He has also supported the theological position of [[continuationism]]; and   composed a list of [[Miracle#Christianity|miracles]] that he personally experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coffeehousetheology.com/miracles/|title=Documented Miracles: Lie #8: "Miracles ceased with the disciples."|last=Marshall|first=Perry|publisher=Coffeehouse Theology|language=English|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Power Lunch at CNBC.jpg|thumb|A ''Power Lunch'' broadcast (2008-03-11)]]

'''''Power Lunch''''' is a television business news program on [[CNBC]], airing between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. It is presented by [[Tyler Mathisen]], [[Kelly Evans]] and [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]].

==History==
Bill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined as Griffeth's original co-presenter from February 4, 2002 to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by [[Sue Herera]], who debuted three days later. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program on December 14, 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began.

''Power Lunch'' originally aired for two hours (noon to 2 ET) until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET, with its run-time cut to 1 hour, making room for ''[[The Strategy Session]]'' at noon ET and the ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money Halftime Report]]'' at 12:30 ET. The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, with run-time now from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' (which aired its final edition three days prior). Sullivan and [[Amanda Drury]], both of whom previously co-anchored ''Street Signs'', joined the program the same day, along with current ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''[[Options Action]]'' host Melissa Lee.  They replaced Herera, who left three days earlier.  Caruso-Cabrera rejoined the program for her third stint as co-presenter on January 19, 2016 after Amanda Drury's departure from CNBC US (in the case of the latter, she rejoined [[CNBC Asia]] as a [[Sydney]]-based correspondent that July). On March 12, 2018, Sara Eisen (previously co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' and currently co-anchor of ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'') and Brian Sullivan swapped their respective anchor roles, with Eisen moving to ''Power Lunch'' and Sullivan moving to ''Worldwide Exchange''.  On November 30, 2018, Eisen and [[Kelly Evans]] swapped their respective anchor roles, with the former moving to ''[[Closing Bell]]'' and Evans moving to ''Power Lunch''.
   
On October 13, 2014, ''Power Lunch'' was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox format.

==Overview==

A '''"Predictable Surprise"''' describes a situation or circumstance in which avoidable crises are marginalized in order to satisfy economic and social policies.

==Definition==
[[Max H. Bazerman]] and [[Michael D. Watkins]] define "predictable surprises" as problems that 
* at least some people are aware of, 
* are getting worse over time, and 
* are likely to explode into a crisis eventually,
* but are not prioritized by key decision-makers or have not elicited a response fast enough to prevent severe damage. 

The problems behind "predictable surprises" tend to require a significant investment in the near term that will not pay off until later. This could involve changes to established organization culture and/or changes that competing interests do not benefit from.


== Examples of predictable surprises ==

* [[Iraq War]]
* [[Enron scandal]]
* [[Subprime mortgage crisis]]&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M (2007)[http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2007/ca20071213_764745.htm BusinessWeek (December 17) Subprime: A Predictable Surprise]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|Hurricane Katrina Response]]&lt;ref&gt;Irons, L (2005) [http://www.hsaj.org/pages/volume1/issue2/pdfs/1.2.7.pdf Homeland Security Affairs Hurricane Katrina as A Predictable Surprise]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Warming]]&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, M (2006) Climate change as a predictable surprise.''Climatic Change'' 77:79-193&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">'''Protected Concerted Activity''' is a legal term used in labor policy to define employee protection against employer retaliation in the [[United States]].  It is a legal principle under the subject of the [[freedom of association]].  The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection.  

The [[National Labor Relations Act]], the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section 7.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Section 7 - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection...&lt;ref&gt;Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Steel, 245 N.L.R.B. 814, 816 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Board v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  

At times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity.&lt;ref&gt;NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, 465 U.S. 822 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an employee who acts as a "whistleblower" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).&lt;ref&gt;See Meyers Industries, Inc., 281 N.L.R.B. 882 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are protected against retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 Report of the Acting General Counsel Concerning Social Media Cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224021509/http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 |date=2013-02-24 }}, OM 12-31 (Jan. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongpin explained that in 2017 he had "appealed this to the Court of Appeals," which then sustained the appeal and "permanently enjoined the SEC  from enforcing these penalties".&lt;ref name=ongpin1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/business/governance/141664-ca-stops-sec-ongpin-trading |title=CA Stops CA SEC order on Ongpin case |access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin also clarified  that, contrary to what was also published in the magazine, Alphaland is not a "$45.7 million property developer, but is "actually a $1.2 billion property developer."&lt;ref name=ongpin4/&gt;&lt;ref name=ongpin1/&gt; Ongpin's business interests lie in real estate development, resort development, mining, energy, and transportation.

==Early life and education==
Roberto Velayo Ongpin was born on January 6, 1937. He is the second of seven children by Luis Roa Ongpin and Lourdes Morales Velayo. He grew up in the neighborhood of Pinaglabanan in San Juan, which was then a suburb of the City of Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/749795/roberto-ongpin-anna-nicole-smith-lovi-poe-mike-arroyo-marcos-lee-kuan-yew |title=Stories about Roberto V. Ongpin |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Ongpin is the great grandson of [[Román Ongpin|Román T. Ongpin]], a Filipino-Chinese businessman and philanthropist who aided Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish and American colonial administration in the Philippine islands. The Ongpins have been named as among the "most influential and enduring families of the Philippines" for their contributions to the nation's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Luis-Ongpin-y-Roa/6000000016207925354?through=6000000016208038677 |title=Roberto V.

Ongpin was able to attend school through a scholarship. After graduating from Ateneo High School, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (cum laude) from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1957. He became a  Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1958, after which he briefly joined Procter &amp; Gamble in Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Ongpin earned his Masters of Business Administration from Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/86/philippines-10_Roberto-Ongpin_S3DA.html |title=Roberto V. Ongpin Forbes Magazine profile|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time in Harvard that he met and married his wife of 55 years, Monica Arellano of Valparaiso, Chile. They have two children together, Stephen Arellano Ongpin and Anna Arellano Ongpin. He also has two other children from different mothers, Michelle Schroer Ongpin and Julian Stone Ongpin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/-depth/09/22/11/ongpin-i-was-technocrat-not-crony|title=Ongpin: I was a technocrat, not crony|last=abs-cbnNEWS.com|first=by Judith Balea,|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1986 People Power Revolution==

In the early hours of February 22, 1986, as Roberto V. Ongpin was preparing to go to Malacañan Palace for a meeting with President Marcos, US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, and Special Envoy Philip Habib, he noticed that his military escorts had been pulled out. Ongpin's subsequent calls to then-Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] inquiring about the whereabouts of his security detail inadvertently alerted Enrile that Marcos may have already been aware of his plans to stage a coup de'tat. This triggered Enrile's hasty break from the government, eventually leading to the [[People Power Revolution]] that installed [[Corazon C. Aquino]] as the new Philippine President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayOne.html |title=People Power Day one |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/364429/us-set-5-conditions-to-save-marcos |title= US sets conditions to save Marcos. |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Sycip Gorres Velayo===
After moving back to the Philippines in 1963, Roberto V. Ongpin was recruited by his maternal uncle, Fred Velayo to work for "the Philippines' largest multidisciplinary professional services firm," [[Sycip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co.|Sycip Gorres Velayo &amp; Company (SGV).]] According to SGV Chairman Emeritus [[Washington SyCip|Washington Sycip]], Ongpin is "one of the most aggressive and effective managers" he has ever known. In 1966, two years after joining the firm, Ongpin - who was barely 30 years old at that time - was named a managing partner of SGV. He served the company from 1964 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/ph/en/about-us/our-people-and-culture/our-history/sgv---co-history |title=History of SGV |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Trade and Industry===

In 1979, Roberto V. Ongpin became the Philippines' youngest Trade and Industry Minister at age 42 when he accepted the invitation of former Philippine President, [[Ferdinand E. Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr.]], to join his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his six-years as Minister, Ongpin grappled with the deteriorating economy as political instability made funding from international agencies and banks difficult for the government. On occasion, he personally had to negotiate financing for the Philippines with other world leaders, including Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/12827/lee-kuan-yew-on-philippines |title=Lee Kuan Yew Interview |access-date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V.

In 1984, with "the Philippines facing a debt and foreign exchange crisis, the black market exchange rate soared to Php 30 per Dollar (versus the official rate of Php 14 per Dollar)." Ongpin is credited with stabilizing the Philippine Peso by establishing the "[[Binondo Central Bank]]," a dual exchange rate system that allowed the government to narrow the rate gap by directly intervening in black market currency prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9053.pdf |title= Debt crisis and adjustment, R.S. Dohner, P. Intal, Jr. |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/364429/us-set-5-conditions-to-save-marcos |title= US sets conditions to save Marcos. |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belle Corp/Tagaytay Highlands===

After the fall of Marcos, Roberto V. Ongpin concentrated on growing his businesses. Among his first ventures Belle Corp. with former fellow Binondo Central Bank veteran, Benito Tan Guat. As chief executive officer, Ongpin was "undoubtedly recognized as the creator" of the Belle's flagship development, Tagaytay Highlands. He was also "instrumental in transforming the property into what it is today, one of the premier developments outside Metro Manila," and "the single largest - and most successful - upscale resort community in the Philippines to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/101002/ongpin-reacts-belles-charges |title=Ongpin on Belle Corp |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/211175/honoring-benito-tan-guat#ixzz4NypwX2zT |title=Benito Tan Guat profile |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alphaland===
Ongpin owns 92% of the shares of Alphaland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2017/08/23/laps-of-luxury/#616974a45fe4 |title= Life in the fast lane|access-date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is chairman of Alphaland Balesin Island Club, Inc., and the City Club at Alphaland Makati Place, Inc.; the developers of the Balesin Island Club, a "world-class, members-only resort that has been described as a 500-hectare paradise with 7.3 kilometers of pristine white sand beaches, located 21 kilometers southwest of Polillo, Quezon Province," and the City Club, an Php 8 billion multi-use commercial residential complex that has three high-rise buildings, a shopping mall, and a "3-hectare leisure, entertainment and business club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/206343/alphalands-city-club-caters-to-the-urban-familys-lifestyle-needs |title= Alphaland City Club caters to urban family lifestyle |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/141753/alphaland-opens-leisure-club-in-makati#ixzz4NyckBGxf |title= Alphaland City Club opens in Makati |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balikbayanmag.com/balesin-island-club/ |title= Balesin Club profile|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Alphaland’s comprehensive net income rose 31% to P7.2 billion, from P5.5 billion in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Corporate&amp;title=ongpin&amp;8217s-aviation-firm-seeks-to-operate-domestic-flights&amp;id=135969 |title= Ongpin's aviation firm seeks to operate domestic flights |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 company profits rose 7.5% to Php 7.7 billion (from Php 7.2B in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biznewsasia.net/alphaland-on-a-roll/|title=Alphaland on a roll|publisher=BizNews Asia|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also owns and operates Alphaland Aviation, Inc.. It has a pending petition before the Philippines Civil Aeronautics  Board (CAB) to be allowed "to be granted the authority to operate domestic air transportation services." Alphaland Aviation currently provides exclusive charter services to Balesin Island Club located in Lamon Bay, Quezon province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Corporate&amp;title=ongpin&amp;8217s-aviation-firm-seeks-to-operate-domestic-flights&amp;id=135969 |title= Ongpin's aviation firm seeks to operate domestic flights |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/134027/cocktales--ongpin-airline-flies-luxury-yacht-sails-past-thunderstorm-digong|title=Ongpin airline flies, luxury yacht sails past thunderstorm Digong |accessdate=Nov 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 Ongpin launched Alphaland Baguio Mountain Lodges, " a 78-hectare master-planned development of 300 lodge-style log homes" in Baguio City, Philippines.The project is being developed at a cost of P5 billion. The first 50 homes is expected to be finished by April 2018; the next 100 homes by April 2019 and the final 150 homes by April 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/2017/10/02/1744507/ongpin-unveils-luxury-benguet-real-estate-development|title=Ongpin unveils luxury Benguet real estate development |accessdate=Nov 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biznewsasia.net/alphaland-on-a-roll/|title=Alphaland on a roll|publisher=BizNews Asia|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PhilWeb Corporation (South Seas Oil and Mineral Exploration Co. Inc.)===
In 1969, Ongpin established South Seas Oil and Mineral Exploration Co. Inc. a mining and exploration company incorporated on August 20 of that year. On March 29, 1984, the stockholders authorized the change in the Company’s name to South Seas Natural Resources, Inc., which was approved by the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philweb.com.ph/about-us/history/ |title=Philweb Corporate History |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2000, South Seas Natural Resources, Inc.  became [[PhilWeb|PhilWeb.Com, Inc.,]] an internet company, upon the stockholders’ approval of a restructuring plan which involved changes in the Company’s name, and primary purpose, among others.

At the annual stockholders’ meeting on May 31, 2002, the stockholders approved the change in corporate name from PhilWeb.com, Inc. to PhilWeb Corporation. The stockholders also approved the inclusion of the gaming business as an additional secondary purpose of the Company. The SEC approved these changes on November 5, 2002.

In August 2016, Ongpin resigned his post as chairman of [[PhilWeb Corporation]], after being tagged by [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Rodrigo Duterte]] as being part of the oligarchy, which was followed by a subsequent order to halt the online gambling industry, which was the core business of Philweb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/410-gaming/142268-philweb-roberto-ongpin-main-reason-resignation|title=PhilWeb reveals 'main reason' behind Ongpin resignation|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Dela Paz|first=Charisse|date=August 7, 2016|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin later clarified that Philweb is "not an online gaming company," but is merely the "software providers of e-Games, which is actually owned by (the [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biznewsasia.net/alphaland-on-a-roll/|title=Alphaland on a roll|publisher=BizNews Asia|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unexpected singling out of Ongpin by the President has puzzled many observers, with some speculating that he may have just been a victim of the Philippines' "murky" politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/world/asia/philippines-duterte-marcos-burial.html?_r=0  |title=New York Times - Push to Give Marcos a Philippine Hero’s Burial Finds an Ally in Duterte |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin however stresses that he 'bears no rancor' towards [[Duterte]]. "He is my President, and I will do all I can to support him and his policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2017/08/23/laps-of-luxury/#616974a45fe4 |title= Life in the fast lane|access-date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin's decision to sell his shares in PhilWeb to former president Marcos' son-in-law, Gregorio Araneta III, has led to a lessening of the political pressure on himself and the company, allowing him to focus on his other business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/07/which-way-mr-president/ |title=Manila Bulletin - Which way Mr. President? |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/134027/cocktales--ongpin-airline-flies-luxury-yacht-sails-past-thunderstorm-digong|title=Ongpin airline flies, luxury yacht sails past thunderstorm Digong |accessdate=Nov 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/araneta-group-acquires-ongpin-shares-in-philweb/|title=Araneta Group acquires Ongpin shares in PhilWeb |accessdate=Nov 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Pallache'''  ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: 'שמואל פאלאץ, ''Shmuel Palach'') (c. 1550 – February 4, 1616), was a [[Jew]]ish-[[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born merchant, diplomat and pirate of the [[Pallache family]], who, as envoy, concluded a treaty with the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1608.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; He is likely an ancestor of [[Haim Palachi]] of 19th-Century [[Izmir]].

==Background==

Pallache was born in [[Fez, Morocco]]. His father, Isaac Pallache, was a rabbi there, first mentioned in ''[[takkanot]]'' (Jewish community statutes) in 1588.  His brother was [[Joseph Pallache]]. His uncle was Fez's grand rabbi, [[Judah Uziel]]; his son [[Isaac Uziel]] was a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

His family originated from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]], where his father had served as [[rabbi]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. According to Professor Mercedes García-Arenal, "The  Pallaches were a Sephardi family perhaps descended from the ''Bene Palyāj'' mentioned by the twelfth-century chronicler [[Abraham ibn Daud|Abraham Ibn Da’ud]] as 'the greatest of the families of Cordoba'."&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan&gt;

Sometime in the first half of the 16th Century, following the Christian conquest of Islamic Spain (the ''[[Reconquista]]''), the family fled to Morocco, where Jews, like Christians, were tolerated as long as they accepted [[Islam]] as the official religion. How they arrived is unclear.  One Italian historian states, "''Verso i Paesi Bassi emigra anche la famiglia Pallache, forse dal Portogallo o dalla Spagna, oppure, secundo un'altra ipotesti, dalla nativa Spagna emigra a Fez, dove un Isaac Pallache è rabbino nel 1588''" (translation:  "The Pallache family also emigrated to the Netherlands, perhaps from Portugal or Spain, or, according to another hypothesis, they emigrated [directly] from their native Spain to Fez, where one Isaac Pallache was rabbi in 1588.")&lt;ref&gt;

After a delegation from the [[Dutch Republic]] visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against [[Spain]] and the [[Barbary pirate]]s, sultan [[Zidan Abu Maali]] in 1608 appointed the merchant Samuel Pallache to be his envoy to the Dutch government in [[The Hague]]. Officially, Pallache served as his "agent", not ambassador.

On June 23, 1608, Pallache met [[stadholder]] [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]] and the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] in The Hague to negotiate an alliance of mutual assistance against Spain. On December 24, 1610, the two nations signed the [[Morocco–Netherlands relations|Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce]], an agreement recognising free commerce between the Netherlands and Morocco, and allowing the sultan to purchase ships, arms and munitions from the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Moor 127"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pUJkIYXBKGMC&amp;pg=PA127 ''Poetry, politics and polemics'' by Ed de Moor, Otto Zwartjes, G. J. H. van Gelder p.127]&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first official treaties between a European country and a non-Christian nation, after the 16th-Century treaties of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The story goes that, one day, Pallache's horse-drawn carriage met the carriage of the Spanish ambassador in The Hague. The two carriages were unable to pass one another and, to cheers from onlookers, the Spanish ambassador's carriage had to make way for Pallache's carriage.

Research has shown that Pallache secretly acted as a double agent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He maintained close ties with the Spanish court and passed classified information about Dutch-Moroccan relations on to the Spanish. At the same time, he was passing information about Spain back to the Dutch and Moroccans. When this eventually came to light, he fell out of favor with the sultan.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In addition to his diplomatic affairs, Pallache also continued his activities as a merchant, actively trading between the Netherlands and Morocco. He also got permission from Prince Maurice for [[privateer]]ing activities. The goods obtained through these pirating activities were sold along the Moroccan coast.

A heavy storm forced him to seek refuge in an English port where, by request of the Spanish ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Prince Maurice came to his aid and helped bring him back to the Netherlands. However, he had lost all his money by then and fell ill shortly thereafter.

===Family (Mediterranean rabbis)===

[[File:Abraham palagi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abraham Palacci]].]] Both ''Les noms des juifs du Maroc'' and ''A Man of Three Worlds'' describe several generations of Pallache family members, which forms the basis of the family descent shown below.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;&lt;ref name=laredo /&gt;

Samuel's wife was Reina (Hebrew ''Malca'') (English "Queen").  ''Les noms'' cites two sons, Isaac and Jacob, ''One Man'' cites only Isaac.  Samuel's brother Joseph had five sons:  [[Isaac Pallache|Isaac]], Joshua, [[David Pallache|David]], [[Moses Pallache|Moses]], and Abraham.  ''One Man'' cites Moses (and David) as most influential person after Samuel's death and de facto leader of the family, even before his own (elderly) father Joseph.

19th Century descendants included four grand rabbis, three in Izmir, Turkey ([[Haim Palachi]], [[Abraham Palacci]], and [[Rahamim Nissim Palacci]]) and one in the Netherlands ([[Isaac Juda Palache]])–[[Pallache family#Documented spellings of surname|spellings of the surname varied]] considerably over the centuries).

(Please see [[Pallache family#Family tree]] sub-section of the [[Pallache family]] entry for a regularly updated list of his family.)

==="Rabbi Pirate"===

Publication of ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' in English (Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins Press:  2003) and originally in Spanish as ''Entre el Islam y Occident: La vida de Samuel Pallache, judío de Fez'' (Madrid: Siglo XXI 1999) has led to some popular emphasis on Pallache as pirate.  A main source of this reputation is Edward Kritzler's book ''Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean'' (2008), which calls Samuel Palache the "Pirate Rabbi" who "was still capturing Spanish ships in his late sixties.".&lt;ref name=Kritzler /&gt;  The book led to reviews with titles like "Sephardi Sea Hawks"&lt;ref&gt;

As part of this process, comments were received during two 60-day public comment periods in 2013 and 2014, and input was received from 12 public workshops across the United States and Canada. About 10,000 stakeholders were invited to submit comments. Participants included public and private landowners, forest sector representatives, Indigenous communities, conservation groups, industry, academia and government officials. 

Independent oversight was provided at each stage of the revision process by the SFI External Review Panel, a group of independent experts representing conservation, professional, academic and public organizations, operating at arm’s length from SFI. The SFI External Review Panel reviewed every public comment submitted to ensure that all comments were considered, and to guarantee the Standard revision process was transparent, objective and credible. The responses to comments are posted on the SFI website.

The SFI Program only certifies lands in the United States and Canada, and program participants must comply with all applicable laws. For sources outside of North America without effective laws, participants must avoid illegal or other controversial sources.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |title=SFI Requirements 2010-2014 Section 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826175220/http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFI Program supports activities by international experts to find ways to address the problem of illegal logging&lt;ref name="C21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |title=Prevent Illegal Logging |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014001529/http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the international, multi-stakeholder Forest Legality Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/fla/ |title=Forest Legality Alliance |publisher=Wri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard promotes responsible forestry practices based on 14 Principles, 13 Objectives, 21 Performance Measures and 55 Indicators that address the 90 percent of the world’s forests that are not certified. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard distinguishes SFI from all other forest certification programs in that it sets mandatory practice requirements for the responsible procurement of all fiber, even if it is sourced from non-certified land. These fiber sourcing requirements include measures to broaden the practice of biodiversity, use best management practices to protect water quality, and utilize the services of forest management and harvesting professionals. Because it governs how SFI Program Participants procure fiber from non-certified land, supporters argue that the Standard encourages the spread of responsible forestry practices.

SFI has certified more than 285 million acres (115 million hectares)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/about-us/basics-of-sfi/|title=Basics of SFI - SFI|author=|date=|website=www.sfiprogram.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its standard in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. At the end of October 2010, SFI had 959 [[chain of custody]] certifications at 2,339 locations.  According to the [[United Nations]], SFI was the fastest growing organization for chain of custody certifications in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717023154/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors that governs the SFI program has three chambers that recognize economic, environmental and social sectors equally.&lt;ref name="C8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/sustainable-forestry-initiative/sfi-governance.php |title=SFI Governance |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014010228/http://www.sfiprogram.org/sustainable-forestry-initiative/sfi-governance.php |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors include representatives of environmental, conservation, professional and academic groups, independent professional loggers, family forest owners, public officials, labor and the forest products industry.&lt;ref name="C9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php#top |title=SFI Board of Directors |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104014327/http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php#top |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and comparisons ==

===Third-party reviews ===

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]/[[Food and Agriculture Organization]], in its ''2009-2010 Forest products Annual Review'', says: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |title=2009-2010 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovetail Partners Inc., in its ''2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report'', states: "the previous differences between forest certification programs are much less distinct ... each program generally has the same structural programmatic requirements, although the required content and level of detail provided by each may vary considerably."&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |title=2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531220823/http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFI is generally considered less stringent than that of the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/science/earth/12timber.html Mireya Navarro, “Environmental Groups Spar Over Certifications of Wood and Paper Products”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0812/environment_1-1.html |article=FSC Versus SFI|author=Christine MacDonald|date=August 12, 2009|publisher=Architecture Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, SFI allows more tree farming and does not require conservation plans or consultation with local and indigenous stakeholders (except for public lands).&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt;

SFI is less highly rated than FSC for example by Consumer Reports “Greener Choices”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels/labelCategory.cfm?labelCategoryName=Sustainable%20Wood 
“Sustainable Wood”&lt;/ref&gt; and Green America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenamerica.org/programs/woodwise/publishers/simplesteps/FSCvsSFI.cfm
"FSC: The Premier Forest Certification Program"
by Jennifer Gerholdt, Magazine PAPER Project Coordinator&lt;/ref&gt; Others rate SFI/PEFC and FSC equally: TerraChoice (part of [[Underwriters Laboratories]] Global Network) in its 2010 Sins of Greenwashing report, like its 2009 one, counts the SFI/PEFC and FSC in its second-tier list of "legitimate" environmental standards and certifications.;&lt;ref name="C17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/findings/greenwashing-report-2010/ |title=Sins of Greenwashing |publisher=Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does Environment Canada's EcoLogo.&lt;ref name="C14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |title=Environment Canada's EcoLogo |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611114921/http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Association of State Foresters forest certification policy statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateforesters.org/node/1032 |title=NASF Resolution No. 2008-7: Forest Certification Policy Statement |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by resolution in 2008 states: "While in different manners, the ATFS (American Tree Farm System), FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability. . . . No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility."

=== Green Building Council ===
On April 5, 2016, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] issued a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) pilot alternative compliance path (ACP) designed to screen out illegal forest products from LEED buildings. While the ACP is being tested as a credit, it will ultimately become a prerequisite that applies to all LEED projects. As a pilot, the ACP does not become a permanent part of the LEED standard without an affirmative vote of the USGBC membership.  The ACP pilot recognizes all certified sources - FSC, PEFC, SFI and ATFS and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGBC Announces New LEED Pilot ACP Designed to Help Eliminate Irresponsibly Sourced Materials—Like Illegal Wood—From the Building Material Supply Chain|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/usgbc-announces-new-leed-pilot-acp-designed-help-eliminate-irresponsibly-sourced-materials%E2%80%94|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACP will apply to all LEED v4 rating systems including Homes v4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Reference Guide for Homes Design and Construction|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-reference-guide-homes-design-and-construction|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to all LEED 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED 2009 Rating System Selection Guidance.” U.S. Green Building Council|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-2009-rating-system-selection-guidance|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; rating systems. 

The ACP categorizes the various forest certification standards based on the ASTM D7612-10 (2015) standard, which is titled “Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Practice for Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7612.htm|website=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASTM ([[ASTM_International|American Society for Testing and Materials]]) International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards.

Other [[green building]] tools, including two [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)-approved rating systems in the United States –  ANSI-ICC 700-2008: National Green Building Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahbgreen.org/Guidelines/ansistandard.aspx |title=National Green Building Standard |publisher=Nahbgreen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Assessment Protocol for Commercial Buildings (formerly Green Globes U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegbi.org/green-globes/ansi-gbi-standard.asp |title=ANSI / GBI Standard |publisher=Thegbi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) –  [[Green Building Initiative|Green Globes]] and [[Built Green Canada]] recognize wood products certified by credible third-party certification programs like SFI.

=== Conservation organizations ===
The SFI Program is supported by conservation groups such as [[Conservation International]], [[American Bird Conservancy]], [[Ducks Unlimited]], and the [[Conservation Fund]] (which serves on its Board).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |title=Board Members |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104014327/http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike SFI, the FSC included environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] among its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc.org/history.html|title=History of FSC|publisher=Fsc.org|date=|accessdate=2013-02-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422113655/http://www.fsc.org/history.html|archivedate=2012-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/forests/solutions-to-deforestation/ |title=Solutions to Deforestation |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Wildlife Federation]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) currently serve on the FSC Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |title=Board of Directors |publisher=Fsc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503212719/http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sierra Club]] endorses only FSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |title=Forest Certification Committee |publisher=Sierraclub.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301171528/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of SFI==

===Marketing practices===
On September 9, 2009 the Washington State Forest Law Center, on behalf of the environmental protection group ForestEthics, filed complaints against SFI Inc. with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;ref name="C23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFIcomplaints |title=Complaints filed against SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name="C23"/&gt;

The FTC complaint accuses SFI Inc. of misleading consumers with deceptive marketing practices. The complaint cites various aspects of SFI’s marketing, including its claim that it is an “independent” not-for-profit organization, its dependence on the timber industry for funding, and the vagueness of SFI’s environmental standards, which allow SFI-certified landowners to be certified merely because the landowner is complying with state environmental regulations. The complaint cites SFI’s certification as an example of [[greenwash]].

Both the FTC and IRS investigated the complaints made against SFI and found them without merit. No action was taken by either investigative body.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS and FTC investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


===Conflict of interest===
The complaint filed with the IRS requests an examination of SFI Inc.’s non-profit status, based on the fact that SFI benefits the private interests of its corporate landowners and not the public interest, as well as the fact that SFI draws more than 80% of its funding from the wood and paper industry.&lt;ref name="C24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisf.research.yale.edu/assets/pdf/ypfc_perspectives/fsc_sfi_comparison.pdf|title=THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THE SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY INITIATIVE: POINTS OF COMPARISON|author=|date=|website=yale.edu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint asserts that in serving the private interests of wood and paper companies that want a ‘green’ image, SFI is inappropriately granted a nonprofit status reserved for public charities.&lt;ref name="C25"&gt;[http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf Washington State Forest Law Center complaint against SFI filed with IRS]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706181943/http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS investigated the complaint as well as conducted a thorough examination of SFI’s non-profit status and concluded that it was appropriate and that no further action was required.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


=== Sierra Club complaint ===

The [[Sierra Club]] has lodged a formal complaint with the SFI,&lt;ref name="C26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFI%20Complaint |title=Sierra Club complaint filed with SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that [[Weyerhaeuser]] engaged in risky and irresponsible logging on steep slopes that led to 1,259 landslides in 2007 on SFI-certified Weyerhaeuser lands in Washington state.&lt;ref name="C27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/1021/news_2-1.html |title=High Tension Over Big Timber |publisher=Architectureweek.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_ofr2008-5_dec2007_landslides.pdf |title=Landslide Reconnaissance Following the Storm Event of December 1–3, 2007, in Western Washington |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging SFI to back up its claims of 'independence' and 'rigorous audits,' the Sierra Club requested that Weyerhaeuser's SFI certification be revoked.&lt;ref name="C26" /&gt;

A peer reviewed landslide study concluded that the Washington State landslides that the Sierra Club attributed to Weyerhaeuser’s logging practices were the result of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and not the result of steep slope logging by the company.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the study needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}} Landslides occur on both logged and unlogged sites, but science shows that logging (and logging roads) dramatically increase the risk of landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregonwild.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/Heiken,%20D.%20Landslides%20and%20clearcuts%20-%20science.pdf|title=LANDSLIDES AND CLEARCUTS: What Does The Science Really Say?|last=Heiken|first=Doug|date=|website=www.oregonwild.org|publisher=Oregon Wild|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Dietrich Garbade''' (September 12, 1873 – January 26, 1961) was a merchant and [[bank]]er, he was President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of [[Cuba]].

As a young man he moved from the German Village of Cigarmakers “''Zigarrenmacherdorf'' “Hastedt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edition-temmen.de/blog/tag/hastedt/|title=Hastedt – DENN MAN TAU|website=www.edition-temmen.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bremen]] to Cuba where he worked as a leaf buyer for [[Hermann Dietrich Upmann]]  and his [[Tobacco industry|Tobacco]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UJRBAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Teodore+Garbade+Cigar&amp;dq=Teodore+Garbade+Cigar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUhJmW2czWAhWRKVAKHZcID5gQ6AEIKDAA|title=United States Tobacco Journal|date=1915|publisher=BMT Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of [[Cuba]], and joined [[H.

Theodore Garbade played a significant role in the settlement between Cuba and the [[United States]] after, [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] succeeded 1913 in passing the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Revenue Act,]] also known as the Tariff Act, or the Underwood Act. The Act established the lowest rates since the [[Walker Tariff]] of 1857. Most schedules were ''ad valorem'' basis, a percentage of the value of the item. This had a profound impact for the Cuban [[Tobacco industry|Tobacco Industry]] concerning their import to the States. As President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of [[Cuba]] Garbade, aided by an appointed committee, laid this out to Cuban ´s President [[Mario García Menocal]] in January 1914, insisting upon an allowance of 50 per cent on their exports of cigars as an equivalent in Cuba’s next reciprocity treaty and urging a prompt solution of this matter so vital to the Cuban cigar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/readbook/TheCubaReview_10559666#106|title=The Cuba Review|website=www.forgottenbooks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German [[Citizenship|Citizen]] in the United States in 1916, he was considered [[prisoner of war]], and put under [[house arrest]] in his mansion in [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisko]], New York. In 1919 he moved to [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]] and in 1921 to [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] where he applied for a Swiss passport.

'''Value measuring methodology''' (or VMM) is a tool that helps [[financial planner]]s balance both tangible and intangible values when making [[investment decisions]], and monitor benefits.

Formal methods to calculate the [[Return on investment]] (ROI) have been widely understood and used for a long time, but there was no easy and widely known way to provide a formal justification for decisions based on intangible values, which can include the reputation of an organization, the wellbeing of staff, or the impact on society or the environment at large.  It was particularly difficult for decision makers to work through the trade-offs between costs and intangible benefits, especially for long-term investments by commercial organizations, and for governments and non-profit organizations who are primarily concerned with intangible values without wasting limited funds.  Even within commercial organizations, units traditionally viewed as "cost centres" found it difficult to get acceptance of proposals for projects that would lead to general and long-term efficiency or capability gains, as the benefits were difficult to assign to "profit centres".

The approach of the VMM is to start by developing a framework of values, including costs, risks, tangible returns and intangible returns, then assign scores to each element in the framework.  Once the relative scores of the different types of values are assigned and agreed, it becomes possible to examine alternatives and give yes/no decisions in a fairly objective and repeatable manner, and review progress using a range of traditional quantitative program management techniques.  As well as allowing comparison of different values within a project, the quantitative approach of the VMM permits review of the total contribution to a particular value across a range of projects.

==History and Adoption==
VMM was developed by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) in collaboration with Harvard University.  The VMM was first articulated in a report by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in 2002 for the US Social Security Administration, as part of an [[E-Services|electronic services]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Remenyi (2006). ''Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Information Technology Evaluation''. p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

It was popularized by a suite of documents released by the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003, which give detailed guidance to agencies helping them to seek funding and plan budgets for their proposals, analyze their investments for values across their portfolio of initiatives, and track both tangible and intangible returns over time, with a particular emphasis on information technology investments and the production of ''OMB-300'' exhibits for the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb US Office of Management and Budget].  The introductory document&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.gov/documents/TheValueof_IT_Investments.pdf Introductory document]&lt;/ref&gt; was given the significant title ''It's Not Just Return on Investment Anymore''.

The suite of documents from the US CIO Council include the following, which are readily adapted for other countries and non-government organizations:&lt;ref&gt;Nagy K. Hanna (2010). ''Transforming Government and Building the Information Society''. p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the steps in the VMM==
Each of the four major steps of the VMM process has tasks and outputs.  The breakdown below, and the description of major value factors, is based primarily on the suite of VMM documents from the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003.

===Develop a decision framework===
*Tasks
**Identify and define value structure
**Identify and define risk structure
**Identify and define cost structure
**Begin documentation
*Outputs
**Prioritized value factors
**Defined and prioritized measures within each value factor
**Initial risk factor inventory
**Risk tolerance boundary
**Tailored cost structure
**Initial documentation of basis of estimate of cost, value and risk

Forcing the development of the decision framework, with the assignment of scores to intangibles allowing comparison to other intangibles as well as tangibles, eases the resolution of differences of perspectives between senior managers (e.g. Chief Financial Officer, Risk Manager, and the proposer of the initiative), allows changes to the scores to flow through to the rest of the process (especially the analysis of alternatives), and provides clarity of benefits to a board (before, during, and after the initiative), and clarity of priorities to people looking after more detailed aspects of the initiative.  The same transparency of values apply if the proposal is developed at an enterprise level, or within a lesser organizational unit.

'''Major value factors''' (from which the value hierarchy is developed) include the following
*direct customer value: benefits to customers/clients, e.g. convenient access, product enhancement
*social: benefits to society as a whole, e.g. reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions
*operational: better operations and lowering barriers to future initiatives, e.g. improved infrastructure
*strategic: contributions to strategic initiatives and fulfilling the mission of the organization
*financial: financial benefits, including increased revenue, decreased costs, and cost avoidance

===Analyze alternatives===
*Tasks
**Identify and define alternatives
**Estimate value and cost
**Conduct risk analysis
**Ongoing documentation
*Outputs
**Viable alternatives for solutions
**Cost and value analyses
**Risk analyses
**Tailored basis of estimate documenting value, cost, and risk, economic factors and assumptions

===Pull the information together===
*Tasks
**Aggregate the cost estimate
**Calculate the return on investment
**Calculate the value score
**Calculate the risk score
**Compare value, cost, and risk
*Outputs
**Cost estimate
**ROI metrics
**Value score
**Risk scores (cost and value)
**Comparison of cost, value and risk

===Communicate and document===
*Tasks
**Communicate value to customers and stakeholders
**Prepare budget justification document
**Satisfy ad hoc reporting requirement
**Use lessons learned to improve processes
*Outputs
**Documentation, insight and support:
***To develop results-based management controls
***For enterprise budget reporting and analysis
***To communicative initiative value
***For improving decision making and performance measurement through "lessons learned"
**Change and ad hoc reporting requirements

==Uses in Capital Investment Planning==
A holistic approach to Capital Investment Planning (CIP), using the portfolio approach, requires a significant amount of supporting documentation.  The VMM approach can provide planning data and performance assessment criteria for the following:

*Summary of spending
*Project description and justification
*Performance goals and measures
*Alternatives analysis
*Risk inventory and assessment
*Program management (partial)
*Acquisition strategy (partial)
*Project and funding plan (partial)
*Business case criteria (partial)

In particular, VMM allows quantitative reporting of commitments to particular intangibles across a number of initiatives, even when they differ by their stage in their lifecycles.
