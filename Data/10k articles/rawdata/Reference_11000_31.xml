Adam D. Weinberg became the Alice Pratt Brown Director of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in October 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa67.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127135059/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa67.htm |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also on the board of trustees of the museum. Before that Weinberg was the Mary Stripp and R. Crosby Kemper Director of the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] at [[Phillips Academy, Andover]], from 1999 until 2003.

During the 1980s, Weinberg worked at the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] where he served as Director of Education and Assistant Curator. He joined the Whitney in 1989 initially as Director of the Whitney branch at the [[Equitable Center]] at 52nd and Seventh Avenue. Weinberg was then appointed to the office of artistic and program director of the venerable [http://www.americancenterfrance.org American Center France] in [[Paris]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/01/arts/for-the-american-center-in-paris-a-new-home-and-a-bitter-dispute.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the patrons considered his departure over organizational politics a loss to the institution. The Whitney reappointed him as Curator of the Permanent Collection in 1993 and was made Senior Curator there in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/panelists/Panelist-2009-/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911184550/http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/panelists/Panelist-2009-/ |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Atlante Internazionale del Touring Club Italiano''''' was a comprehensive world reference [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]] first published by the [[Touring Club Italiano]] in 1927.

In order to give Italy an extensive reference atlas modelled on foreign examples such as ''[[Stielers Handatlas]]'' in Germany, shortly after [[World War I]] preparatory work to this end began under the direction of Luigi Vittorio Bertarelli (founder of the TCI, 1859–1926) with collaboration of Olinto Marinelli as scientific editor and Pietro Corbellini as chief cartographer. The atlas, in which toponymy was based on the official language of each country, was presented to the public in 1927 as '''''Atlante Internazionale del Touring Club Italiano'''''; it had 169 leaves of maps, large folio format, and contained more than 200,000 entries. The second edition appeared already one year later and received the highest recognitions at the International Geographical Congress in Cambridge. Three more editions were issued up to [[World War II]].

After the war the atlas maintained the same character with relief in the style of the great classic atlases (hachuring), in contrast to newly published works, that used isohypses ([[contour lines]]) to indicate altitudes. This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the ''Atlante Internazionale'', the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the map surface consisted of about 18 square metres! The eighth edition was finally reprinted in 1977.

'''William Reid "Bill" Eadie''' (born December 27, 1947) is an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who has competed under the names of '''Ax''' as part of [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] and '''The Masked Superstar'''. He was a high school teacher and coach at [[Cambridge High School (Cambridge, Ohio)|Cambridge High School]] in [[Cambridge, Ohio]], and at [[East Liverpool, Ohio]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===National Wrestling Alliance and World Wide / World Wrestling Federation (1973–1984)===
Eadie's first match was on December 15, 1972 under the name "The Paramedic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/demolition-ax-bill-eadie-plans-to-end-his-career-where-he-started-it-in-pittsburgh/Content?oid=3470519|title=Demolition Ax, Bill Eadie, plans to end his career where he started it, in Pittsburgh|last=Leturgey|first=Thomas|work=Pittsburgh City Paper|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1973, he wrestled under a mask as the tag team "Para-Medics" in [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]'s Detroit territory. He then wrestled in Pittsburgh, Detroit, [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963-1979)|WWWF]], and the IWA as '''Bolo Mongol''', the new partner of his trainer, [[Newton Tattrie|Geeto Mongol]].&lt;ref name="WWLegends"&gt;{{cite book |author=Solomon, Brian |title=WWE Legends | chapter= Nikolai Volkoff |page=164 |publisher=Pocket Books |year=2006 |isbn=0-7434-9033-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon entered the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory under the management of Boris Malenko and donned a mask as '''The Masked Superstar''', given the character at the advice of matchmaker George Scott. It was stated that he was an Olympic champion by various wrestling promoters. He challenged opponents with a $10,000 reward to whoever could break his "cobra clutch", as well as utilizing the "corkscrew neckbreaker".&lt;ref name=HOFHeels&gt;{{cite book |author=Greg Oliver |author2=Steve Johnson |last-author-amp=yes |title=the [[Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame]] - The Heels |publisher=ECW Press |year=2007 |chapter=The Technicians: The Masked Superstar |pages=258–261 |isbn=978-1-55022-759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masked Superstar was 6' 3", weighed 300&amp;nbsp;lbs and created many mismatches due to his size, strength and quickness. He had many bouts with [[Mighty Igor]], [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], [[Blackjack Mulligan]], [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Mr. Wrestling II]], [[Stan Hansen]] and [[Tommy Rich|"Wildfire" Tommy Rich]], and [[Dick Murdoch]].&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt; He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of "12" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan. It is believed that neither feat of hour or hour and a half cage matches has since been performed by any wrestlers.&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt; He was one of the first wrestlers to body slam [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt; Among other accomplishments, he won four [[NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship|Georgia Heavyweight]] titles and unified that title with the [[NWA National Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=GeorgiaHeavy/&gt;&lt;ref name=NWANational/&gt; He also competed in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] against many top wrestlers in 1983-84. He fought against many top level opponents, including then WWF champion [[Bob Backlund]], [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]], and [[Jimmy Snuka]].&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt;

===Return to WWF (1986–1990)===
In 1986, he returned to the World Wrestling Federation and became '''Super Machine''' with [[André the Giant]] as ''Giant Machine'' and [[Blackjack Mulligan]] as ''Big Machine''. Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of [[Bobby Heenan]] and his massive tag team of [[Big John Studd]] and [[King Kong Bundy]]. ([[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]]' masks and gimmick were copied from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character "[[Junji Hirata|Super Strong Machine]]", played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]]).&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt; Eadie later dropped the Machine gimmick and left the WWF to head to [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida]] for a run as the Masked Superstar, upending [[Lex Luger]] to win the NWA Southern title.&lt;ref name=NWASouthern/&gt;  He held the title for two weeks before Luger regained it.

In January 1987, Eadie returned to the WWF and formed the tag team [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] with [[Randy Colley]], formerly Moondog Rex, who wrestled as Smash while Eadie wrestled as Ax. Colley was later replaced by [[Barry Darsow]] as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed. Though they began as [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s, their unique brawling style and charisma made them so popular that they became [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]s in November 1988.&lt;ref name=Demolition&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver | author2=Steve Johnson | last-author-amp=yes | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= The National era (1980s to present): Demolition | pages= 253–255 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] three times as a team of two, but lost the belts at [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam 1990]] after they reverted to being heels by forming a threesome with [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]].&lt;ref name=WWFTag/&gt; The trio concept was precipitated by a mutual decision to phase out the Ax character and for Eadie to take a backstage role in the company.&lt;ref name=Demolition/&gt; Popular rumor at the time cited heart problems on Eadie's part, which have been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement.&lt;ref name=Demolition/&gt; Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series 1990]].&lt;ref name=Demolition/&gt; This event also marked the last time that he and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]] worked together for sixteen years.

In the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as "Jake Bullet" in the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''. He and Smash appeared in several [[Pizza Hut]] commercials for the "Kids Night Out" promotion widely seen on national television.

==="New" Demolition; Independent circuit (1991–1999)===
Around 1991, Ax formed a new tag team, using the Demolition name, and pairing up with a {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}} Canadian wrestler, dubbed "Canadian Giant" or "Demolition Hux." They toured with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], facing established stars such as Masa Saito, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami, at the same time that Smash and Crush were still wrestling under the name for the then WWF and on Japanese tours with [[Super World of Sports]]. Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways.

Eadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar. On August 15, 1997, Eadie was disqualified in a match against [[Jimmy Snuka]] at the ''IWA Night of the Legends'' show in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] after hitting special guest referee [[Ricky Steamboat]].&lt;ref&gt;Apter, Bill.

On March 14, 1999, Eadie and Ben Steele captured the NAWA United States Tag Team Championship from Kane and Abel Atoms in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midatlanticwrestling.net/resourcecenter/results/pages/results_superstar.htm |title=Mid-Atlantic Superstar Wrestling Results - Masked Superstar (Bill Eadie) |author=Baker, David |author2=Graham Cawthon |author3=Mark Eastridge |author4=Rich Tate |author5=Jim Zordani |date=July 31, 2010 |website=MidAtlanticWrestling.net |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the independent circuit  (1999–2017)===
[[File:Demolition Ax.jpg|thumb|Demolition Ax in the ring in 2006]]
As of 2013, Eadie still wrestles occasionally for independent promotions and makes signing appearances in "legends" shows across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Masked Superstar defeated [[Greg Valentine]] for the Mid-Atlantic Heritage Championship. The title changed hands at the Carolina Wrestling Classic on Saturday, June 2, 2007 at the L.P. Frans Stadium in [[Hickory, North Carolina]]. The [[Millennium Wrestling Federation]] reunited Ax and Smash of Demolition at the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion April 1, 2007, prior to [[WrestleMania 23]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. They began regularly competing as Ax and Smash for the first time in 16 years. Alongside One Man Gang, Demolition competed in the [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]] [[King of Trios#2008|King of the Trios Tournament]] in 2008, but were eliminated in the second round by "The Fabulous Three" ([[Larry Sweeney]], Mitch Ryder and Shayne Hawke). On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the [[Keystone State Wrestling Alliance]] (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ax was inducted because of his success, and the fact that he is a native of Brownsville, PA, also in Western Pennsylvania.

On October 2, 2010 Ax made his third appearance for the Dynamic Wrestling Alliance based in Middletown, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedwa.com/|title=北京赛车pk10 PK10开奖直播 北京赛车pk拾开奖结果历史记录 - pk10直播网|author=|date=|website=thedwa.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2011, [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] reunited at [[Full Impact Pro]]'s debut [[pay-per-view|iPPV]] ''In Full Force''. Their match against [[Tony DeVito]] and Ralph Mosco went to a no contest when local commentator and manager Larry Dallas came out and said his men wanted revenge. The ring was stormed by [[Afa Anoaʻi Jr.|Manu]], [[Sami Callihan]], Blain Rage and Joey Attel. Demolition, Devito and Mosco managed to clear the ring and beat Dallas to end the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dgusa.tv/board/index.php?PHPSESSID=1b02d3d0acc1b68eb23747f5372cdb8b&amp;topic=1233.0|title=Full Force 2011 results|accessdate=2011-05-21|publisher=Dragon Gate USA forum}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition returned to Chikara on September 16, 2012, taking part in a tag team [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet match|gauntlet match]], from which they eliminated The Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive and Max Smashmaster), before being eliminated themselves by their old WWF rivals, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|Warlord]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chikarapro.com/results.php |title=Past results |work=[[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]] |accessdate=2012-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017033657/http://www.chikarapro.com/results.php |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2017, Eadie announced his retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=110092|title=BILL EADIE RETIRES, SANTINO MARELLA RETURNING TO THE RING? - PWInsider.com|author=|date=|website=www.pwinsider.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he went on to have two more matches. His final singles match took place at KSWA's "Brawl Under the Bridge" event in the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA on July 22, 2017. On August 12, 2017, Eadie had his final match, resulting in a victory in a 6-man tag team match for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Canton, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=181779]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Eadie formerly supported the good work of the Inner Harbour Hospital Springs Campus in [[Rockmart, Georgia]]. For several years, the Masked Superstar has made many of his masks and wrestling gear available to wrestling fans through raffles and auctions, the proceeds of which support the general operating fund of the non-profit Inner Harbour Hospital, which has since closed and all operations moved to The Shoals campus in Douglasville, Georgia due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=HOFHeels/&gt;

In July 2016, Eadie was named part of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE sued in wrestler class action lawsuit featuring Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka, Paul ‘Mr Wonderful’ Orndorff|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/what-the-fox/wwe-sued-in-wrestler-class-action-lawsuit-featuring-jimmy-superfly-snuka-paul-mr-wonderful-orndorff/news-story/079fbd7db16f9cd71b7b569672baa4a5|work=[[FoxSports.com]]|date=July 18, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]] ([[21st Century Fox]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; US District Judge [[Vanessa Lynne Bryant]] dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piledriver: WWE uses 'Hell in a Cell' as springboard to future shows|url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/2018/09/22/wwe-uses-hell-cell-springboard-future-shows/1394073002/|work=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|last=Robinson|first=Byron|date=September 22, 2018|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long time friend of André the Giant outside of wrestling, Eadie revealed in a 2016 interview that André was the godfather to his two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nti7NZfp9UM|title=Demolition on Andre The Giant|first=|last=THE HANNIBAL TV|date=15 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bergeron v.

'''comparethemarket.com''' is a UK [[price comparison service|price comparison]] website, founded in 2006, that is part of the [[BGL Group]]. The website also offers other on-line companies the ability to provide their customers with a co-branded or [[White-label product|white labelled]] comparison service.&lt;ref name="BGL" /&gt;

In 2009 the company launched an advertising campaign featuring a series of [[meerkat]] characters, after which it became the third-largest price comparison website in the UK.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==History==
The website was set up by Budget Group (now [[BGL Group]]) in early 2006,&lt;ref name="IBM0506" /&gt; following a decision to sell its high street business to [[Swinton Insurance|Swinton]].&lt;ref name="IBM0906" /&gt;

In 2012, [[Compare the Market Australia|Comparethemarket.com.au]] launched its comparison service in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare_the_Market_Australia#cite_note-5 | title=Compare the Market Australia | access-date= 28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} The Australian company's television advertisements also feature the meerkat characters Aleksandr Orlov and his Head of IT, Sergei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare_the_Market_Australia#cite_note-13 | title=Compare the Market creates first local meerkat campaign with ‘Mission Impawsible’ | access-date= 28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} However, these ads differ from the UK’s, with one such storyline revealing the meerkats have purchased comparethemarket.com.au.

In September 2017, it was announced the company was under investigation by the competition regulator surrounding allegations regarding most favoured nation clauses with home insurance providers.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/comparethemarket-investigated-alleged-deals-insurers |title=Comparethemarket.com investigated over alleged deals with insurers |author=Miles Brignall |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/comparethemarket-deals-insurers-push-up-prices-policy-insurance-cma-competition-markets-authority-a7968241.html |title=Comparethemarket.com reportedly under investigation over deals with insurers to push up policy prices |author=Ben Chapman |publisher=Independent |date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/26/comparethemarketcom-investigation-competition-watchdogs-insurance/ |title=Comparethemarket.com under investigation by competition watchdogs over insurance pricing |author=Katie Morley |publisher=The Telegraph |date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison Products===
Compare the Market allows customers to compare prices on a number of insurance products including car, home, van, life, pet, travel and over 50s insurance. It has also expanded in to the comparison of items that can be switched such as energy/utilities, broadband and digital TV, as well as a range of financial products such as loans, credit cards and ISAs.

===Compare the Meerkat campaign===
[[File:AleksandrOrlovmeerkat.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Aleksandr Orlov" meerkat character used in the company's advertising since 2009]]
{{main|Compare the Meerkat}}
On 5 January 2009, the company launched an advertising campaign featuring a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] Russian meerkat character named "Aleksandr Orlov"&lt;ref name="Digitalartsonline" /&gt; who pleads with viewers looking for cheap car insurance to stop confusing his meerkat comparison website ''comparethemeerkat.com'' with ''comparethemarket.com'', due to the similarity between the words ''meerkat'' and ''market''. As part of the campaign, Comparethemeerkat.com was created which does indeed allow visitors to compare meerkats.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;

In August 2009 an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper accused the advert series of [[racism]] for mocking [[Eastern Europe]]an accents. However, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] stated that it had not received any similar complaints.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

On 12 November 2012, the website started sponsoring the long-running soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in a three-year deal, costing around £30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="MW0712" /&gt;

===Other adverts===
In December 2012 another advert was launched this time featuring Maurice Wigglethorpe-Throom (played by [[Robert Webb]]) the founder of Compare the Market and his assistant Spencer who find out about Aleksandr (who makes a cameo appearance in a photograph) and Compare the Meerkat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11245">[[Image:ComparisonMicroscope.png|thumb|In a comparison microscope, two identical microscopes are connected to a single comparison eyepiece. The viewer sees the images from both microscopes next to one another, as in the inset image.]]
A '''comparison microscope''' is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two [[microscope]]s connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.

==History==
In the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

===Col. Calvin H. Goddard===
{{Main|Calvin Hooker Goddard}}
[[Image:goddardcomparison-wiki.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Goddard with comparison microscope]] Philip O. Gravelle, a [[chemist]], developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired [[bullets]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of [[firearms]] identification in [[forensic science]]. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], breach block, [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], or [[firing pin]] in the [[gun]]. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. "As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work." Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Thorwald, '''The Century of the Detective''', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sir Sydney Smith]] also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to [[Scotland]] and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.

==Modern comparison microscope==
The modern instrument has many [[optical]], [[Machine|mechanical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] refinements, including [[fiber optic]] illumination, [[video]] capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single [[firearm]] based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a "no conclusion" result if insufficient marks are present.&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;John H. Dillon, Jr , Comparison Microscopy: The Origins of Firearms identification, A Practical Application of Forensic Science, Technology and Engineering to Case Linkage in Shooting Incidents Not Previously Related by Investigative personnel, BulletTRAX-3D, MatchPoint Plus and the Firearms Examiner, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match [[bullet]]s and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of [[forensic science]].

Visualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.

==Forensic ballistics==
{{Main|Ballistics}}

The prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the [[United States]] compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As with most firearms, the fired [[ammunition]] components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as "ballistics".

Historically, and currently, this [[forensic ballistics|forensic discipline]] ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired [[bullet]]s or [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]], one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.

The interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called [[Rifling#Manufacture|rifling]]) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called "lands" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a "signature" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this "signature" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.

When a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a [[crime scene]], forensic examiners compare the [[Ballistic fingerprinting|ballistic fingerprint]] of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.

==Notable cases==
===Sacco and Vanzetti case===
{{Main|Sacco and Vanzetti}}
Forensic innovator [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure [[conviction]]s of accused murderers and anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]]. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the [[electric chair]]. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the [[Capital punishment|executions]] and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a [[semi-automatic pistol]] could be traced by several different methods if both [[bullet]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|casing]] were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by [[firing pin]] indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] in 1927.
Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect [[gun barrel]]s, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.
In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.

===St. Valentine's Day massacre===
{{Main|St. Valentine's Day Massacre}}
Colonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in which seven gangsters were killed by rival [[Al Capone]] [[mobster]]s dressed as [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at [[Northwestern University]] and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, [[ballistics]], [[fingerprinting]], blood analysis and [[trace evidence]] were all brought under one roof.
In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Conciliation''' is an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties both separately and together in an attempt to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, encouraging parties to explore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable outcome.

Conciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award.

Conciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that in conciliation, often the parties are in need of restoring or repairing a relationship, either personal or business.

== Conciliation Technique ==
A conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to "give" on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn. The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.

Most successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (United States)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]] in the United States.

==Historical conciliation==
Historical conciliation is an applied conflict resolution approach that utilizes historical [[narratives]] to positively transform relations between societies in conflicts. Historical conciliation can utilize many different methodologies, including [[mediation]], [[Sustained Dialogue|sustained dialogue]], apologies, acknowledgement, support of public commemoration activities, and public diplomacy.

Historical conciliation is not an excavation of objective facts. The point of facilitating historical questions is not to discover all the facts in regard to who was right or wrong. Rather, the objective is to discover the complexity, ambiguity, and emotions surrounding both dominant and non-dominant cultural and individual narratives of history. It is also not a rewriting of history. The goal is not to create a combined narrative that everyone agrees upon. Instead, the aim is to create room for critical thinking and more inclusive understanding of the past and conceptions of “the other.”

Conflicts that are addressed through historical conciliation have their roots in conflicting [[Identity (social science)|identities]] of the people involved. Whether the identity at stake is their ethnicity, religion or culture, it requires a comprehensive approach that takes people’s needs, hopes, fears, and concerns into account.

==Japan==
[[Japan]]ese law makes extensive use of {{nihongo|conciliation|調停|chōtei}} in civil disputes. The most common forms are civil conciliation and domestic conciliation, both of which are managed under the auspice of the court system by one judge and two non-judge "conciliators."

Civil conciliation is a form of dispute resolution for small lawsuits, and provides a simpler and cheaper alternative to litigation. Depending on the nature of the case, non-judge experts (doctors, appraisers, actuaries, and so on) may be called by the court as conciliators to help decide the case.

Domestic conciliation is most commonly used to handle contentious [[divorce]]s, but may apply to other domestic disputes such as the annulment of a marriage or acknowledgment of paternity. Parties in such cases are required to undergo conciliation proceedings and may only bring their case to court once conciliation has failed.

'''DMOZ''' (from ''directory.mozilla.org'', an earlier [[domain name]]) was a multilingual [[open content|open-content]] [[Web directory|directory]] of [[World Wide Web]] links. The site and community who maintained it were also known as the '''Open Directory Project''' ('''ODP'''). It was owned by [[AOL]] (now a part of [[Verizon]]'s [[Oath Inc.]]) but constructed and maintained by a [[virtual community|community]] of volunteer editors.

DMOZ used a hierarchical [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] scheme for organizing site listings. Listings on a similar topic were grouped into categories which then included smaller categories.

DMOZ closed on March 17, 2017 because AOL no longer wished to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://searchengineland.com/dmoz-has-officially-closed-271530|title=DMOZ has officially closed after nearly 19 years of humans trying to organize the web|work=[[Danny Sullivan (technologist)#Search Engine Land|Search Engine Land]]|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=March 17, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resource-zone&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.resource-zone.com/forum/t/why-dmoz-was-closed.53529/ |title=Why Dmoz Was Closed ? |website=Resource-Zone.com |date=April 16, 2017 |access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website became a single landing page on that day, with links to a static archive of DMOZ, and to the DMOZ discussion forum, where plans to rebrand and relaunch the directory are being discussed.&lt;ref name=resource-zone /&gt;

{{As of|2017|9}}, a non-editable mirror remained available at dmoztools.net,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dmoztools.net/ |title=The Directory of the Web – This site includes information formerly made available via DMOZ|website=dmoztools.net|date=  |author= |accessdate= August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was stated that while the DMOZ URL would not return, a successor version of the directory would and did, at Curlie.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.resource-zone.com/forum/t/new-dmoz.53614/ |title=New dmoz |website=Resource-Zone.com |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://curlie.org/top/present.html |title=Curlie: Present |website=curlie.org |date=2017-03-29 |access-date=2017-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918065934/http://curlie.org/top/present.html |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

DMOZ was founded in the United States as '''Gnuhoo''' by [[Rich Skrenta]] and [[Bob Truel]] in 1998 while they were both working as engineers for [[Sun Microsystems]]. Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed [[TASS (software)|TASS]], an ancestor of [[Tin (newsreader)|tin]], the popular threaded [[Usenet]] newsreader for [[Unix]] systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.

The Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] objected to the use of "Gnu" in the name, Gnuhoo was changed to NewHoo.&lt;ref name="SlashdotGnuhoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/06/23/0849239| accessdate = April 27, 2007|work=[[Slashdot]] | title=The GnuHoo BooBoo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yahoo!]] then objected to the use of "Hoo" in the name, prompting a proposed name change, to ZURL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html "Zurl Directory"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223080027/http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html |date=December 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to switching to ZURL, NewHoo was acquired by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the [[Open Directory License]]. Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.

[[File:Odp sitecount top.png|thumb|400px|DMOZ size by date, 1998 to 2015.]]
By the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the [[Yahoo! Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geniac.net/odp/ ODP and Yahoo Size Charts] by ODP editor geniac&lt;/ref&gt; DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.

In January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006.&lt;ref name="odpreports"&gt;[http://freenet-homepage.de/miscellanea/odp_reports/ ODP reports] by ODP volunteer administrator chris2001&lt;/ref&gt; These reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included "Test" and "Bookmarks" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006.&lt;ref name="odpreports"/&gt; 75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007.&lt;ref  name=frontpage&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/ ODP Front Page]. Retrieved August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2013, the number of contributing editors had increased to 97,584.&lt;ref name=frontpage /&gt;

===System failure and editing outage, October to December 2006===
On October 20, 2006, DMOZ's main server suffered a [[catastrophic failure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dmozgrunt.blogspot.com/2006/10/dmozs-catastrophic-serverhardware.html|title=Dmoz's Catastrophic Server/Hardware Failure|work=dmozgrunt.blogspot.com|date=October 27, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that prevented editors from working on the directory until December 18, 2006. During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public. On January 13, 2007, the Site Suggestion and Update Listings forms were again made available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.li/20070108033810/http://www.resource-zone.com/forum/showthread.php?t=45325 dmoz.org technical problems] archive.li Retrieved July 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2007, weekly publication of RDF dumps resumed. To avoid future outages, the system resided on a redundant configuration of two Intel-based servers from then on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miscellanea.de/newsletter/2006Winter/new_servers.html ''The Hamsters' New Home''], in: Open Directory newsletter issue Winter 2006. Retrieved December 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded "DMOZ 3.0", but AOL took it offline the following year.

===Competing and spinoff projects===
As DMOZ became more widely known, two other major [[Web directory|web directories]] edited by volunteers and sponsored by [[Go.com]] and [[Zeal (web)|Zeal]] emerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for [[open content]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml "Terms of Use"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202210117/http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml|date=February 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html "GO Network Terms of Service and Conditions of Use"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510161046/http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html |date=May 10, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as [[ChefMoz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html ''ChefMoz Fine Dining Menu''], in: Open Directory newsletter issue Autumn 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and an encyclopedia known as [[Open Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-site.org/help/ help] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629225234/http://open-site.org/help |date=June 29, 2008 }} on open-site.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, according to [[Larry Sanger]], DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the [[Nupedia]] project, out of which [[Wikipedia]] grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/13/media.newmedia|title=This time, it'll be a Wikipedia written by experts|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Moody|first=Glyn |date=July 13, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from [[Usenet]]. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, "I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2065949/the-search-engine-report-july-1998-number#newhoo|title=NewHoo: Yahoo Built By The Masses|work=[[Search Engine Watch]]|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for ''Adult'', ''Arts'', ''Business'', ''Computers'', ''Games'', ''Health'', ''Home'', ''News'', ''Recreation'', ''Reference'', ''Regional'', ''Science'', ''Shopping'', ''Society'', ''Sports'' and "World". While these sixteen ''top-level'' categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.

In July 1998, the directory became [[multilingualism|multilingual]] with the addition of the ''World'' top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the ''World'' level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.

Several of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The ''Adult'' category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: ''Regional'' and ''Topical''.

On November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html Kids and Teens Launches!] Open Directory Project Newsletter, November/December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Key factors distinguishing this "Kids and Teens" area from the main directory are:
* stricter guidelines which limit the listing of sites to those which are targeted or "appropriate" for people under 18 years of age;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |title=Kids&amp;Teens Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* category names as well as site descriptions use vocabulary which is "[[age appropriate]]";
* ''age tags'' on each listing distinguish content appropriate for kids (age 12 and under), teens (13 to 15 years old) and mature teens (16 to 18 years old);
* Kids and Teens content is available as a separate RDF dump;
* editing permissions are such that the community is parallel to that of DMOZ.

By May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.

Since early 2004, the whole site has been in [[UTF-8]] encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be [[ISO 8859-1]] for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.

===Maintenance===
Directory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.

Robozilla is a [[Web crawler]] written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the [[link rot]] in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.

Due to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on [[Web search engine|search engine]] rankings (See [[PageRank]]), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted [[domain hijacking]], an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.

While corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, [[bookmarklet]]s to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,&lt;ref&gt;[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/176740 "ODPExtension"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }} Mozilla based add-on, ODP Magic. formerly known as ODP Extension&lt;/ref&gt; and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.

===License and requirements===
DMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the [[Open Directory License]], which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.

The Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the [[Free Software Foundation]] to refer to the [[Open Directory License]] as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.

In 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution license{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, which is a free license (and GPL compatible).&lt;ref&gt;GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccby on the Creative Commons Attribution license]&lt;/ref&gt;

===RDF dumps===
DMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |title=Open Directory RDF Dump |publisher=Rdf.dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626235229/http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |archivedate=June 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; New versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.steevithak.com/sw/odp/rdflist.html|title=ODP/dmoz Data Dump ToDo List|work=steevithak.com|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid [[XML]], it is not valid [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.

===Content users===
DMOZ data powers the core [[directory service]]s for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]. [[Google Directory]] used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Streamlining: Say Goodbye to the Google Directory and Labs!|url=http://www.pandia.com/sew/3963-google-streamlining-say-goodbye-to-the-google-directory-and-labs.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Pandia Search Engine News|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Overture]] announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, "in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gigablast.com/prdir.html|title=Gigablast Launches 500,000 Vertical Search Engines|work=[[Gigablast]]|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2006|9|8}}, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ Category: Sites Using ODP Data] on www.dmoz.org. Retrieved September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these figures do not reflect the full picture of use, as those sites that use DMOZ data without following the terms of the DMOZ license are not listed.

==Policies and procedures==
[[File:Rich Skrenta.jpg|alt=|thumb|DMOZ was co-founded by [[Rich Skrenta]] (depicted in 2009, age 42).]]
Restrictions are imposed on who can become an DMOZ editor. The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a [[conflict of interest]], and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi |title=Become an Editor at the Open Directory Project |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

DMOZ's editing model is a [[Hierarchal structure|hierarchical]] one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

DMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.&lt;ref name="commguide" /&gt;

Over time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are ''editall'' privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. ''Meta'' privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. ''Cateditall'' privileges are similar to ''editall'', but only for a single directory category. Similarly, ''catmod'' privileges are similar to ''meta'', but only for a single directory category. ''Catmv'' privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with ''meta'' editors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In August 2004, a new level of privileges called ''admin'' was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.&lt;ref name="adminguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |title=Open Directory Project Administrator Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |title=ODP Directory Editorial Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely. DMOZ Guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Controversy and criticism==
There have long been allegations that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.webmasterworld.com/forum17/94.htm|title=How To: ODP Editor Is Competitor|work=webmasterworld.com|date=November 4, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/meta/abuse.html ODP Meta Guidelines: Editor Abuse and Removal]. Retrieved October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new ''Public Abuse Report System'' that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report-abuse.dmoz.org/ |title=Open Directory Project: Public Abuse Report System |publisher=Report-abuse.dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807152404/http://report-abuse.dmoz.org/ |archivedate=August 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream [[webmaster]] discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/add.html |title=How to suggest a site to the Open Directory |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/search?search=topix Open Directory Project Search: "topix"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=Robertgombos |fix-attempted=yes }} (Retrieved October 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the history of DMOZ, its staff gave representatives of selected companies, such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' or [[CNN]], editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.webmasterworld.com/forum17/1330.htm|title=Multiple URL's in DMOZ|work=webmasterworld.com|date=January 30, 2003|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Links to individual CNN articles were added until 2004, but were entirely removed from the directory in January 2008&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.dmoz.org/News/ http://www.dmoz.org/News/], taken from Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; due to the content being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain. There have been no similar experiments with the editing policy since then.

===Ownership and management===
[[File:DMOZ Closed.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Screenshot taken in April 2017 showing DMOZ website to be closed.]]
Underlying some controversy surrounding DMOZ is its ownership and management. Some of the original GnuHoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name="SlashdotGnuhoo" /&gt; To varying degrees, those complaints have continued up until the present.

At DMOZ's inception, there was little thought given to the idea of how DMOZ should be managed and there were no official [[Internet forum|forums]], guidelines or [[FAQ]]s. In essence, DMOZ began as a free for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laisha.com/zine/odphistory.html|title=The Open Directory Project: The Spirit of the Web|work=laisha.com|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went on, the ODP Editor Forums became the ''de facto'' DMOZ parliament and when one of DMOZ's staff members would post an opinion in the forums, it would be considered an official ruling.&lt;ref name="commguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/communication.html |title=ODP Communication Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, DMOZ staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges, including the ability to approve new editor applications, which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among DMOZ editors, with DMOZ's paid staff having the final say regarding DMOZ's policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="adminguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metaguide" /&gt;

Robert Keating, a principal of Touchstone Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. since 2006, has worked as AOL's Program Manager for DMOZ since 2004. He started working for AOL in 1999 as Senior Editor for AOL Search, then as Managing Editor, AOL Search, DMOZ, and then as Media Ecosystem Manager, AOL Product Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.dmoz.org/2009/01/08/meet-aols-dmoz-staff-team/ Meet AOL's DMOZ Staff Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101091318/http://blog.dmoz.org/2009/01/08/meet-aols-dmoz-staff-team |date=January 1, 2012 }}, DMOZ Blog, January 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-keating/2/457/424 Robert Keating] LinkedIn&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editor removal procedures===
DMOZ's editor removal procedures are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place.&lt;ref name="metaguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/meta/ |title=Open Directory Project Meta Guidelines |website=dmoz.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304211520/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/meta/ |archivedate=March 4, 2017 |date=December 31, 2013 |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modeled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.&lt;ref name="yahooxodp"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/xodp/conversations/topics/1|title=Life After ODP|work=[[Yahoo! Groups]]|last=Prenatt|first=David|date=May 29, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article "Editor Removal Explained", DMOZ meta editor Arlarson states that "a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from DMOZ results from false or misleading statements by former editors".&lt;ref&gt;Arlarson, [http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Sep/removal.html Editor Removal Explained], Open Directory Project Newsletter (September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The DMOZ's confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current DMOZ editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals.&lt;ref name="metaguide" /&gt; However, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/accounts.html#removal |title=Guidelines: Account Removal |website=dmoz.org |archiveurl=http://dmoztools.net/docs/en/guidelines/accounts.html#removal |archivedate=March 17, 2017 |date=July 3, 2016 |accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, this has led to removed DMOZ editors wondering why they cannot login at DMOZ to perform their editing work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.resource-zone.com/forum/t/editor-account-expired.18061/|title=Editor account expired|work=resource-zone.com|date= July 27, 2004|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resource-zone.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3655 Thread: Can't Login] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128044638/http://www.resource-zone.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3655 |date=November 28, 2008 }} on Resource-Zone&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations that editors are removed for criticizing policies===
David F. Prenatt, Jr., former DMOZ editor ''netesq'', and another former editor known by the alias ''The Cunctator'', both claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to policies, particularly DMOZ's [[copyright]] policies. According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors.&lt;ref name="yahooxodp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.traffick.com/story/06-2000-xodp.asp|title=Life After the Open Directory Project|work=traffick.com|last=Prenatt, Jr|first=David F.|date=June 1, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200320/http://www.traffick.com/story/06-2000-xodp.asp|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CmdrTaco |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/00/10/24/1252232.shtml |title=Dmoz (aka AOL) Changing Guidelines In Sketchy Way |work=[[Slashdot]]|date=October 24, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blacklisting allegations===
Senior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach "warning" or "do not list" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmoz.org/urlnote.html Add Note to URL Feature], in ODP Documentation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical structure===
Criticism of DMOZ's [[hierarchical]] structure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of [[Web 2.0]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]] began to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, [[network (mathematics)|networks]] and [[directed graph]]s are more "natural" and easier to manage than hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hriţcu|first=C.|url=http://hritcu.wordpress.com/2005/04/08/folksonomies-vs-ontologies/ |title=Folksonomies vs. Ontologies|work=hritcu.wordpress.com|date=April 8, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail470.html "Ontology is Overrated"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729231420/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail470.html |date=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hammond, Tony |author2=Hannay, Timo |author3=Lund, Ben |author4=Scott, Joanna |url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html |title=Social Bookmarking Tools (I)|work=[[D-Lib Magazine]]|date=April 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

===Search===
The ODPSearch software is a derivative version of [[Isearch]] which is [[open source]], licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/docs/en/searchguide.html |title=Open Directory Search Guide |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editor forums===
The ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary [[Ultimate Bulletin Board]] system. In June 2003, they switched to the open source [[phpBB]] system. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.

===Bug tracking===
The bug tracking software used by the ODP is [[Bugzilla]] and the web server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]. [[Squid cache|Squid]] web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.

===Interface===
The DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the [[GNU General Public License]]). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license.  The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OtherLicenses|title=Licenses for Works of Practical Use besides Software and Documentation|work=[[GNU Project]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories. The only credible alternative, now that DMOZ, has closed is Curlie, where the links from DMOZ have been utilised and many of the DMOZ editors work there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4971">'''DNS Analytics''' is the [[surveillance]] (collection and analysis) of [[Domain Name System|DNS]] traffic within a [[computer network]]. Such analysis of [[Domain Name System|DNS]] traffic has a significant application within [[information security]] and [[computer forensics]], primarily when identifying [[insider threat]]s, [[malware]], [[cyberweapon]]s, and ''[[advanced persistent threat]]'' (APT) campaigns within computer networks.

Since DNS Analytics processes and interactions involve the communications between DNS clients and DNS servers during the resolution of DNS queries and updates, it may include tasks such as request logging, historical monitoring by node, tabulation of request count quantities, and calculations based on network traffic requests.  While a primary driver for DNS Analytics is security described below, another motivation is understanding the traffic of a network so that it can be evaluated for improvements or optimization.  For example, DNS Analytics can be used to gather data on a lab where a large number of related requests for PC software updates are made.  Finding this, a local update server may be installed to improve the network.

==Published Research==
Research within the public domain shows that state-sponsored [[malware]] and [[advanced persistent threat|APT]] campaigns exhibit [[Domain Name System|DNS]] ''[[indicator of compromise|indicators of compromise]]'' (IOC). Since June 2010, analysis of [[cyberweapon]] platforms and agents has been undertaken by labs including [[Kaspersky Lab]], [[ESET]], [[Symantec]], [[McAfee]], [[Norman Safeground]], and [[Mandiant]]. The findings as released by these organizations include detailed analysis of [[Stuxnet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf | title = Stuxnet Under the Microscope | publisher = [[ESET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flame (malware)|Flame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193540/The_Roof_Is_on_Fire_Tackling_Flames_C_C_Servers | title = The Roof is on Fire - Tracking Flames C&amp;C Servers| publisher = [[Kaspersky Lab]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hidden Lynx,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf | title = Hidden Lynx | publisher = [[Symantec]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Troy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcafee.com/sg/resources/white-papers/wp-dissecting-operation-troy.pdf | title = Dissecting Operation Troy | publisher = [[McAfee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NetTraveler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securelist.com/en/downloads/vlpdfs/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-part1-final.pdf | title = The Nettraveler, Part 1 | publisher = [[Kaspersky Lab]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Hangover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://normanshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NS-Unveiling-an-Indian-Cyberattack-Infrastructure_FINAL_Web.pdf | title = Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure | publisher = [[Norman Safeground]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandiant]] [[APT1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf | title = Mandiant APT1 Report | publisher = [[Mandiant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Careto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securelist.com/en/downloads/vlpdfs/unveilingthemask_v1.0.pdf | title = Unveiling the Mask | publisher = [[Kaspersky Lab]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[malware]] and [[Advanced persistent threat|APT]] campaigns can be reliably identified within computer networks through the use of DNS analytics tools.

==DNS Analytics Tools==
*[[Endgame, Inc.]] developed a tool named Clairvoyant Squirrel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/jasontrost/flo-con-clairvoyant-squirrel-final | title = Clairvoyant Squirrel Large-scale Malicious Domain Classification | date = January 2013 | last = Munro | first = Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; which performs large-scale malicious domain classification.
*[[AlphaSOC|AlphaSOC LLC]] developed DNS Analytics for Splunk&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.splunk.com/app/1657/ DNS Analytics for Splunk]&lt;/ref&gt; which performs DNS anomaly detection within environments.
*OMS DNS Analytics, which uses Microsoft threat intelligence, provides client names that are resolving malicious domains, stale records and other useful DNS analysis tools. 
*[https://dnsmadeeasy.com/ DNS Made Easy] developed [https://dnsmadeeasy.com/services/dns-analytics/ DNS Analytics] that shows clients the query traffic for their domain(s) in real time. This tool can be used to troubleshoot influxes in query traffic, identify potential attacks, stale records, and optimize network configurations. The DNS Analytics platform also includes a query logging feature that records queries as they hit a client's nameservers. Logs can be downloaded and used for troubleshooting.
*[https://constellix.com Constellix] (a subsidiary of DNS Made Easy) also has its own [https://constellix.com/dns/realtimestatistics/ DNS Analytics] platform with a query logging feature.

The '''Armenian Declaration of Independence''' ({{lang-hy|Հայաստանի Անկախության Հռչակագիր}}) is the [[declaration of independence]] of the Armenian provinces from the [[Russian Empire]].

In view of the complete political collapse of the Trans-Caucasus and the new situation created by the proclamation of the independence of Georgia and Azerbaijan, the Armenian National Council declares itself the supreme and sole administration of the Armenian provinces. Due to certain grave circumstances that prevent us from forming an Armenian National Government, the Armenian National Council temporarily assumes all governmental functions in order to pilot the political and administrative leadership of the Armenian provinces.

The '''''Doria Atlas''''' is a 16th-century atlas commissioned by and named for the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] military leader [[Andrea Doria]]. Likely compiled around 1570, it is a composite atlas featuring 186 printed and manuscript maps&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Map: A Mind-Expanding Exploration of the Way the World Looks |author=Simon Garfield |authorlink=Simon Garfield |year=2012 |publisher=Penguin Group |location= |isbn=9781592407798 |page=143 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from two distinct atlases of the [[Lafreri atlases|Lafreri school]].&lt;ref name="Sothebys"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2005/the-library-of-lord-wardington-important-atlases-and-geographies-part-one-l05415/lot.143.html |title=Doria Atlas |author= |date=18 October 2005 |work=Sothebys.com |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains rare Italian maps dating to the 1620s, in addition to a series of [[manuscript]] maps, written by little-known publishers during the 1620s and 1630s and detailing the commercial, political and military interests of the Doria family.&lt;ref name="Sothebys" /&gt; As of the 21st century it is one of the world's [[List of most expensive books|most expensive books]].

Having passed through successive generations of the Doria family, and later the British Rail Pension Fund, it was bought at auction by rare book collector Christopher Pease, 2nd [[Baron Wardington]], for £240,000 in September 1988. In April 2004, the ''Doria Atlas'' was saved from a fire at [[Wardington Manor]] in [[Oxfordshire]], when approximately 50 local residents "formed a human chain" to remove items from the Wardington library while firefighters were still attempting to put out the fire.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare atlases snatched from fire |last1=Bennett |first1=Will |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1491071/Rare-atlases-snatched-from-fire-to-be-sold.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=31 May 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of the rare atlases contained in the library were saved with little or no damage, extensive damage to the property forced Lord Wardington to auction much of the collection.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

Repair costs, in addition to Wardington's advanced age and frailty, forced a sale of 700 items from the collection.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mapped-out fortunes |last1=Thorncroft |first1=Tony |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e2d91542-55a0-11db-acba-0000779e2340.html |newspaper=Financial Times |date=7 October 2006 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d07e9748-da40-11e1-902d-00144feab49a.html|title=Mapping the price of atlases|last=Temple|first=Peter|date=3 August 2012|work=Financial Times|access-date=20 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Doria Atlas'' was sold at auction by [[Sotheby's]] in October 2005.

Its sale price was the highest ever for an atlas, a record surpassed by the ''[[Cosmographia_(Sebastian_Münster)|Cosmographia]]'' the following year.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Atlas favoured by Columbus goes on sale for £1 million |last1=Milmo |first1=Cahal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/atlas-favoured-by-columbus-goes-on-sale-for-1631-million-419065.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdiad''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈfʲerðiað|pron}}; also ''Fer Diad'', ''Ferdia'', ''Fear Diadh''), son of Damán, son of Dáire, of the [[Fir Domnann]], is a warrior of [[Connacht]] in the [[Ulster Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. In the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'', Ferdiad finds himself on opposite sides to his best friend and foster-brother [[Cúchulainn]] who may also have been his lover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol and Spirit|last= Conner |first= Randy P. |year=1998 |publisher=Cassell |location=UK |isbn=0304704237 |page=116 "Cú Chulainn and er diadh"}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with whom he had trained in arms under the renowned warrior woman [[Scáthach]]. He and Cúchulainn are equal in all martial feats, with two exceptions: the ''[[Gáe Bulg]]'', a barbed spear which Scáthach has taught only Cúchulainn to use; and Ferdiad's horny skin, which no weapon can pierce.

When [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] and [[Medb]], king and queen of Connacht, invade [[Ulaid|Ulster]] to steal the bull [[Donn Cúailnge]], their progress is held up by Cúchulainn, who demands single combat. After Cúchulainn has defeated a series of Connacht champions, Medb sends for Ferdiad, but he only agrees to fight Cúchulainn after [[Findabair]], Ailill and Medb's daughter, has seductively plied him with alcohol, and Medb has variously bribed, shamed and goaded him to do so. They fight in the ford for three days, first fighting with 8 swords, darts, and spears, then fighting with "throwing-spears" and lances, and finally moving on to "heavy, hard-smiting swords." It is on the third day that Ferdiad starts to gain the upper hand. At this point, Cúchulainn calls to his charioteer, Laeg, for the ''Gáe Bolga'', which he floats down the river to him. Cúchulainn throws a light spear at Ferdiad's chest, causing him to raise his shield, and then picks up the ''Gáe Bolga'' between his toes and thrusts it through his anus upon which the barbs spread throughout his body, killing him. The ''Gáe Bolga'' is then removed from Ferdiad's body by Laeg, and Cúchulainn mourns Ferdiad's death, praising his strength and bravery:

:"Ah, Ferdiad, betrayed to death."
:"Our last meeting, oh, how sad!"
:"Thou to die I to remain."
:"Ever sad our long farewell!"

&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dunn, "The Ancient Irish Epic Tale Táin Bó Cúalnge", London:David Nutt, 1914 [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/cool/cool20.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciarán Carson, ''The Táin'', Pg 151&lt;/ref&gt; The ford where he died is named ''Áth Fhirdiad'' (Ferdiad's ford, modern ''Baile Átha Fhirdhia'' or [[Ardee]], [[County Louth]]) after him.&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly, ''Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1976, pp. 195-208 [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301012/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly, ''Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967, pp. 211-234 [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301035/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars believe that the fight between Cuchulainn and Ferdiad is a late addition to the Táin, originating not earlier than the eleventh century and drawing on earlier episodes in the story.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ''Ferdiad'' means "man/warrior of the pair" (''Diad'' related to ''dïas'', "two persons").{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But can also be read as "Fear" (man) "dia" (god), as opposed to Cúchulainn's position as a literal god-man (being a demigod, his father the chief god Lugh).

The '''Finnicization of Helsinki''' is the transformation of [[Helsinki]], Finland from a [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking city to one that is bilingual or even multilingual, with [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as both the majority language and [[lingua franca]]. The dominant aspects of this transition were the immigration of Finnish speakers in the process of urbanization, and the shift from Swedish to Finnish among some local [[Finland Swedes|Swedish]]-speaking residents over several generations.

[[Helsinki]] was founded by the [[King of Sweden|Swedish King]], [[Gustav Vasa]] in 1550 as [[Helsingfors]]. At the time, Finland was an integral part of [[Sweden]], the surrounding region, [[Nylandia]] was predominately Swedish speaking and Swedish was the administrative language of the kingdom. 

In the nineteenth century, during the Russian period, Helsinki became the economic and cultural centre of Finland. Beginning from the late 19th century, the Finnish language became more and more dominant in the city, since the people who moved to the city were mostly Finnish-speaking.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was already predominantly Finnish-speaking, although with a large Swedish-speaking minority. In the 21st century, native-Swedish speakers are a minority of 6.1%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">The '''Gwyneddigion Society''' ({{lang-cy|'''Cymdeithas y Gwyneddigion'''}}) was a [[London]]-based [[Wales|Welsh]] literary and cultural society. The original society was founded in 1770 and wound up in 1843. It was briefly revived in 1978. Its proceedings were conducted through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

==History==
The Gwyneddigion Society was founded in December 1770 by a group of expatriate Welshmen resident in London, its first formal meeting taking place on 4 February 1771. Foremost of the founders was [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] (known as Owain Myfyr), who became the society's first President. Originally from [[Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr]], Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2008, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early members included [[Iolo Morganwg]] (Edward Williams), [[William Owen Pughe]], [[John Jones (Jac Glan-y-gors)|Jac Glan-y-gors]] (John Jones), [[John Edwards (1747–1792)|Siôn Ceiriog]] (John Edwards), [[Edward Jones (harpist)|Edward Jones]] ("Bardd y Brenin"), and [[Twm o'r Nant]] (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning "Gwynedd scholars") suggests a particular link with the region of [[Gwynedd]], its affiliations were from the start with the whole of [[North Wales]], and later with all parts of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Leathart 1831, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 346"&gt;Davies 2008, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including [[harp]]-playing and [[Cerdd Dant|penillion-singing]]), and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in [[Walbrook]], and one member, [[David Samwell]], wrote:
:In Walbrook stands a famous Inn
:Near ancient Watling Street
:Well stored with brandy, beer and gin,
:Where Cambrians nightly meet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the "centre of Welsh literary life" ("''canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad''").&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society promoted annual [[eisteddfod]]au in Wales, the precursors of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] (the first being held at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'' (1789) and ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'' (1801–07).&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

A noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of [[John Evans (explorer)|John Evans]]' exploration of North America in search of the legendary "Welsh Indians", the supposed descendants of [[Madoc|Madog ab Owain Gwynedd]].&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

From the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the [[Cymreigyddion Society]] (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Revival==
A new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

'''''Hercules''''' is a 1907-built steam [[tugboat]] that is now preserved at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

==History==

''Hercules'' was built in 1907 by [[John H. Dialogue and Sons]], of [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]]. She was built for the [[Shipowners' and Merchants' Tugboat Company]] of [[San Francisco]], as part of their [[Red Stack Fleet]] (a part of today's Crowley Maritime Corporation). After completion, ''Hercules'' was sailed to San Francisco via the [[Straits of Magellan]] with her sister ship, ''[[Goliah (steam tug 1907)|Goliah]]'', in tow.

For the first part of her life, ''Hercules'' was an oceangoing tug. Because of the prevailing northwest winds, [[sailing ships]] often employed ''Hercules'' and her sisters on journeys north up the coast from San Francisco. For example, in 1916, ''Hercules'' towed {{ship||C.A. Thayer|1895|2}} to [[Port Townsend, Washington]]. On return trips back down the coast, ''Hercules'' often towed [[log raft]]s of [[Pacific Northwest]] timber, to [[Southern California]] mills. At other times, ''Hercules'' was employed towing [[barges]] to other ports on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and to [[Hawaii]], and in transporting equipment for the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].

In 1924, ''Hercules'' was acquired by the [[Western Pacific Railroad]]. For her new owners, she worked shuttling [[railroad car floats]] across [[San Francisco Bay]] from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] to San Francisco.

In 1947, she and the tugboat ''Monarch'' were given the task of towing the hulk of the battleship {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} to San Francisco Bay to be scrapped. However, 500 miles from Hawaii, they were struck by a powerful storm and the ''Oklahoma'' began taking on water and sinking, threatening to drag the two tugs along with her. While the ''Monarch'' managed to release her lines, ''Hercules'' could not get free until the last moment, narrowly avoiding being dragged into the deep by the ''Oklahoma.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newell|first1=Gordon|title=Pacific Tugboats|date=1957|publisher=Superior Publishing|location=Seattle, Washington|ISBN=978-1258209568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, she returned to shuttling car floats and worked in this role until 1957, when she was replaced by the diesel-powered [[train ferry]] {{ship||Las Plumas|ferry|2}}. ''Hercules'' was kept in a stand-by role to the new ferry until 1961.

The [[California State Park Foundation]] acquired ''Hercules'' in 1975, and the [[National Park Service]] took over her restoration in 1977. In 1986 she was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. She is now one of the exhibits of the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] and is to be found moored at the park's Hyde Street Pier.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''''', ({{lang-ar| جامع التواريخ }} ''Compendium of Chronicles'', {{lang-mn|Судрын чуулган}}, {{lang-fa| جامع‌التواریخ }}) is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]] in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Inal. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (1247–1318) at the start of the 14th century, the breadth of coverage of the work has caused it to be called "the first world history".&lt;ref name="Melville"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melville|first=Charles|title=JĀMEʿ AL-TAWĀRIḴ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jame-al-tawarik|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in three volumes.  The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages, with versions in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Carey. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the [[Ilkhanate]], in the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the [[Nasser Khalili#Islamic Art Collection|Khalili Collection]], comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the [[Edinburgh University Library]]. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the [[Topkapı Palace]] Library in [[Istanbul]]. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent "one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium",&lt;ref&gt;''Compendium of Chronicles'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the [[Persian miniature]].

==The author==
{{main article|Rashid-al-Din Hamadani}}
Rashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at [[Hamadan]], Iran into a Jewish family. The son of an [[apothecary]], he studied medicine and joined the court of the Ilkhan emperor, [[Abaqa Khan]], in that capacity. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty. He rapidly gained political importance, and in 1304 became the [[vizier]] of emperor and Muslim convert [[Ghazan]]. He retained his position until 1316, experiencing three successive reigns, but, convicted of having poisoned the second of these three [[Khan (title)|Khans]], [[Öljaitü]], he was executed on July 13, 1318.

Hamdani was responsible for setting up a stable social and economic system in Iran after the destruction of the Mongol invasions, and was an important artistic and architectural patron. He expanded the university at [[Rab'-e Rashidi]], which attracted scholars and students from Egypt and Syria to China, and which published his many works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadigh|first=Soudabeh|title=Ilkhanid Structures Discovered in Tabriz|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6754|publisher=CHN|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a prolific author, though few of his works have survived: only a few theological writings and a correspondence which is probably apocryphal are known today in addition to the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''. His immense wealth made it said of him that he was the best paid author in Iran.

==The work==
[[File:GhazanConversionToIslam.JPG|250px|left|thumb|"The conversion of [[Ghazan]] Khan to [[Islam]]", [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] manuscript, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Supplément persan 1113, c. 1430]]
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' was one of the grandest projects of the Ilkhanate period,&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Lorenz Books| isbn = 978-0-7548-2087-1| last = Carey| first = Moya| title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture| year = 2010|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; "not just a lavishly illustrated book, but a vehicle to justify Mongol hegemony over Iran".&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The text was initially commissioned by Il-Khan Ghazan, who was anxious for the Mongols to retain a memory of their nomadic roots, now that they had become settled and adopted Persian customs. Initially, the work was intended only to set out the history of the Mongols and their predecessors on the steppes, and took the name ''Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī'', which makes up one part of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''. To compile the History, Rashid al-Din set up an entire precinct at the university of [[Rab'-e Rashidi]] in the capital of [[Tabriz]]. It contained multiple buildings, including a [[mosque]], hospital, library, and classrooms, employing over 300 workers.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

After the death of Ghazan in 1304, his successor [[Öljaitü]] asked Rashid al-Din to extend the work, and write a history of the whole of the known world. This text was finally completed in sometime between 1306 and 1311.

After Rashid al-Din's execution in 1318, the Rab-i-Rashidi precinct was plundered, but the in-process copy that was being created at the time survived, probably somewhere in the city of Tabriz, possibly in the library of Rashid's son, Ghiyath al-Din. Later, Rashid's son became Vizier, in his own right, and expanded the restored university precinct of his father. Several of the ''Jāmiʿ''{{'}}s compositions were used as models for the later seminal illustrated version of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' known as the [[Demotte Shahnameh|Demotte ''Shahnameh'']].&lt;ref name=b31&gt;Blair. pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in [[Herat]], perhaps claimed after a victory by the [[Timurid dynasty]]. It then passed to the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556–1605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince [[Farzada Kuli]]. This fragment was acquired by Colonel [[John Baillie of Leys]] of the [[East India Company]], and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library.&lt;ref name=b31/&gt; The other portion was acquired by [[John Staples Harriott]] of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General [[Thomas Gordon (British Army officer)|Thomas Gordon]]. He then bequeathed it to the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]], where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for £850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990.

To write the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'', Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified:
* From Iran, it is very similar to work by [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] historian who wrote an account of the [[Mongol Empire]] entitled ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay|Taʾrīkh-ī jahān-gushāy]]'' "History of the World-Conqueror". Also from Iran, the ''Shahnameh'' is drawn upon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/shahnameh/vgallery/section2.html?p=25&amp;g=,13,14,15,16,18,23,24,25,26,27,28,29 Fitzwilliam Museum], Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;
* For Europe, the ''Chronicle of the Popes and the Emperors'' of [[Martin of Opava]]
* For the Mongols, it seems that he had access to the [[Altan Debter]], through the ambassador of the Great Khan to the court of the Il-Khanate.
* For China, the author knew the translation of four Chinese manuscripts: three on medicine and one on administration. Furthermore, it is known that he enjoyed calligraphy, painting and Chinese music. The links with this world were made all the easier because Mongols also ruled the Chinese empire.

===Contents===
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' consists of four main sections of different lengths:

1. The ''Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī'', the most extensive part, which includes:
:* The Mongol and Turkish tribes: their history, genealogies and legends
:* The history of the Mongols from [[Genghis Khan]] up to the death of Mahmud Ghazan

2. The second part includes :
:* The history of the reign of Öljaitü up to 1310 (no known copy)
:* The history of the non-Mongol peoples of Eurasia (a [[universal history]] from the time of Creation, following the organization of work of the Abbasid historian [[al-Tabari]] in his ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', often referred to as ''at-Tabari's HIstory,'' and to the historic Muslim history of [[Qazi Beiza'i]] in the ''Neẓām al-tawārīkh'':
:** [[Adam]] and the patriarchs
:** the kings of the [[history of Iran|pre-Islamic Iran]]
:** [[Muhammad]] and the Caliphs ([[Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate]]s)
:** the Islamic dynasties of Persia ([[Ghaznavids]], the shahs of [[Khwarezm]], the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]-ruled [[Alamut]])
:** the [[Turkic peoples]],
:** the [[History of China]]
:** [[Jewish history]],
:** [[Frangistan]] (ie., Europe, primarily the [[Papal States]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]])
:** the [[History of India|Indians]].

3. The ''Shu'ab-i panjganah'' ("Five genealogies, of the Arabs, Jews, Mongols, Franks, and Chinese"). This text exists in two copies of the manuscript in the library of the Topkapı Palace in [[Istanbul]] (ms 2937&lt;!-- says U.Chicago library; fr. WP says 29 321 --&gt;), but has only been published on microfilm.

4. The ''Suwar al-akalim'', a geographical compendium. Unfortunately, it has not survived in any known manuscript.

===Illustrations===
Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in the [[Muslim world]] in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Bloom &amp; S. Blair|title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art Vol. II|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the illustration for the various ''Tawarikh'' copies was probably done at the Rab-al Rashidi university complex, a contemporary written account mentions that they were also done elsewhere in Mongol empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom &amp; Blair, Grove Enlycl., Vol. II p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Battle of Badr.jpg|thumb|250px|Mohammed exhorting his family before the [[Battle of Badr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rashid |last=al-Din |url=http://warfare.uphero.com/Persia/13-14C/Jami_al-Tawarikh-Mohammed_exhorting_his_family_before_the_battle_of_Badr-Khalili-Ms727-f66a.htm |title=Khalili Collection, MSS. 727, folio 66a |date=1305–14 |work=Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The scene now in the Kahlili collection illustrating the [[Battle of Badr]] used a collection of stock figures, and scholars are in disagreement as to who is represented. One descriptor says it shows Muhammad with [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib]] and [[Ali]] before sending them to battle. Another says Muhammad is on the right, but Hamza and Ali on the left, or perhaps the center. Another description says it is Muhammad exhorting his family to fight, and that he may be one of the central figures, but it is not clear which one.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questions about the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''===
There is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din’s editorial authorship but the work is generally considered a collective effort. It may also be possible that it was compiled by a group of international scholars under his leadership. Yet, a number of questions remain about the writing of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh.'' Several others, such as Abu’l Qasim al-Kashani, claimed to have written the ''universal history''. Rashid al-Din was of course a very busy man, with his public life, and would have employed assistants to handle the materials assembled and to write the first draft: Abu'l Qasim may have been one of them. Furthermore, not all of the work is original: for instance, the section on the period following the death of Genghis Khan in particular is directly borrowed from Juvayni. Other questions concern the objectivity of the author and his point of view: it is after all an official history, concerning events with which Rashid al-Din in his political capacity was often involved at first hand (for the history of the Ilkhanate in particular). Nonetheless, the work "is characterized by a matter-of-fact tone and a refreshing absence of sycophantic flattery." &lt;ref name="Melville"/&gt;

==Contemporary manuscripts of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh''==
[[File:Mongol siege Jami al-Tawarikh Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio from the Edinburgh collection, showing a miniature painting of Mongols besieging a city. Note the elements protruding beyond the frame.]]
The ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic manuscripts===
The earliest known copy is in Arabic, dated to the early 1300s. Only portions of it have survived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/khan8/hd_khan8.htm |title=Folios from the Jami' al-tavarikh|work=Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=January 15, 2012|quote=Today only two early-fourteenth-century Persian copies of the Compendium and part of one Arabic copy survive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided into two parts between the [[University of Edinburgh]] (151 folios) and the Khalili Collection (59 folios), although some researchers argue for these being from two different copies. Both sections come from the second volume, with the pages interwoven. The Edinburgh part covers some of the earlier history up through a section about the Prophet Muhammad, and then this story is continued in the Khalili portion, with further narratives weaving back and forth between the two collections, ending with the final section also being in the Edinburgh collection.

====Edinburgh folios====
The Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2&amp;nbsp;cm, with a written area of 37 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]] calligraphy.  There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuks]] and [[Atabey]]s, and the history of the sultans of [[Khwarezm]]. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]], who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as "Baillie's collection".

Seventy rectangular [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of [[Tabriz]] at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.

The miniatures have an unusual horizontal format and only take up about a third of the written area; this may reflect the influence of Chinese scrolls. Some parts of the surviving text are heavily illustrated and other parts not at all, apparently reflecting the importance accorded to them. The miniatures are ink drawings with [[watercolour]] washes added, a technique also used in China; although they are generally in good condition, there was considerable use of metallic silver for highlights, which has now oxidized to black. Borrowings from Christian art can also be seen; for example the ''Birth of Muhammad'' adapts the standard Byzantine composition for the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]]'', but instead of the [[Biblical Magi]] approaching at the left there is a file of three women.&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 28; Canby, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  The section includes the earliest extended cycle of illustrations of the [[Depictions of Muhammad|life of Muhammad]].  Like other early Ilkhanid miniatures, these differ from the relatively few surviving earlier Islamic book illustrations in having coherent landscape backgrounds in the many scenes set outside, rather than isolated elements of plants or rocks.  Architectural settings are sometimes given a sense of depth by different layers being shown and the use of a three-quarters view.&lt;ref&gt;Min Yong Cho, 12-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice distinguished four major painters and two assistants:

* The ''Painter of [[Iram of the Pillars|Iram]]'': the most influenced by China (reflected in Chinese elements, such as trees, interest in the landscape, interest in contemplative characters). The work is characterized by open drawing, minimal modelling, linear drapery, extensive details, stripped and balanced compositions, delicate and pale colours, and a rare use of silver. He painted mostly the early miniatures, and may have been assisted by the ''Master of [[Tahmura]]''.
* The ''Painter of [[Lohrasp]]'': characterized by a variety of subjects, including many throne scenes, a variable and eclectic style, quite severe and angular drapery, a verity of movements, stripped and empty backgrounds. His absence of interest in landscape painting shows a lack of Chinese influences, which is compensated for by inspiration from Arab, Syrian and Mesopotamian painting. His work is of variable quality, and uses silver systematically. His assistant: the ''Master of Scenes from the Life of the Prophet''.
* The ''Master of the Battle Scenes'': a somewhat careless painter, as becomes evident when the number of arms does not match the number of characters, or a leg is missing among the horses.  He is notable for a complete lack of focus and horror, and for strong symmetry, his compositions usually comprising two parties face to face composed of a leader and two or three followers. Decoration is limited to grass, indicated in small vegetative clumps, except during sieges and attacks on the city.
* The ''Master of [[Alp Arslan]]'' appears briefly, at the end of the manuscript. His style is crude and unbalanced, his characters often badly proportioned.

Just as distinguishable are different racial and ethnic types, made manifest not just in the physical attributes of the characters, but also their clothes and their hats. One can thus distinguish a remarkably well observed group of [[People of Ethiopia|Abyssinians]], Western-style figures based on Syrian Christian manuscripts, Chinese, Mongols, Arabs, and so on.

The Edinburgh folios were displayed at an exhibition at the [[Edinburgh University Library|University of Edinburgh Main Library]] in summer 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Emma|last2=Skeldon|first2=Steven|title=The World History of Rashid al-Din, 1314.

====Khalili folios====
[[File:Buddha offers fruit to the devil - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Buddha offers fruit to the devil'', [[Khalili Collection]]]]
The portion in the [[Khalili Collection]], where it is referred to as MSS727, contains 59 folios, 35 of them illustrated.
Until sold in 1980 it was owned by the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in London. It is a different section of the History than that of the Edinburgh version, possibly from a different copy. Each page measures {{convert|43.5|by|30|cm|in}} (slightly different dimensions to the Edinburgh portion due to different models copied). According to Blair's description of the collection, "Two major sections were lost after division: thirty-five folios (73-107) covering the life of Muhammad up to the caliphate of Hisham, and thirty folios (291-48) going from the end of the Khwarazmshahs to the middle of the section on China. The latter may have been lost accidentally, but the former block may have been jettisoned deliberately because it had no illustrations. The folios about the life of the Prophet were further jumbled, and four were lost. The final three folios (301-303) covering the end of the section on the Jews were also lost, perhaps accidentally, but judging from the comparable section in MS.H 1653, they had no illustrations and may also have been discarded."&lt;ref&gt;Blair. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was brought to Western attention by William Morley, who discovered it in 1841 while he was cataloguing the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. For some time this collection was displayed in the [[King's Library]] of the [[British Museum]]. It includes twenty illustrations, plus fifteen pages with portraits of the emperors of China. The text covers the history of Islam, the end of China's history, the history of India, and a fragment from the history of the Jews. The work of the Painter of Luhrasp and Master of Alp Arslan is again evident. Some differences in style can be observed, but these can be attributed to the difference in date. A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Persian manuscripts===
[[File:Assassination_of_Nizam_al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] (left, in white turban) fatally stabs [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Seljuk vizier, in 1092, from Topkapi MS H 1653.]]
There are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the [[Topkapi Palace]] Library, [[Istanbul]].

* MS H 1653, made in 1314, which includes later additions on the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid era]] for Sultan [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]]. The full collection, known as the ''Majmu'ah'', contains [[Bal'ami]]'s version of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]]'s chronicle, the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'', and [[Nizam al-Din Shami]]'s biography of [[Timur]]. The portions of the ''Jāmiʿ'' cover most of the history of the Muhammad and the Caliphate, plus the post-caliphate dynasties of the Ghaznavids, Saljuqs, Khwarazmshahs and Is'mailis, and the Turks. It contains 68 paintings in the Ilkhanid style.
* MS H 1654, made in 1317, which includes 118 illustrations, including 21 pages of portraits of Chinese emperors. It was copied for Rashid al-Din, and like H 1653 was later owned by Shahrukh.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. pp. 27–28, and note 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later versions and manuscripts===
Interest in the work continued after the Ilkhans were replaced as Persia's ruling dynasty by the [[Timurids]].  [[Timur]]'s youngest son, [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shahrukh]], who ruled the eastern portion of the empire from 1405–47, owned incomplete copies of the ''Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh'' and commissioned his court historian [[Hafiz-i Abru]] to complete it.  The earliest dated manuscript made for Shahrukh includes the original text and additions by Hafiz-i Abru, along with other histories, and is dated 1415-16 (Topkapi Palace Library, MS B 282).  The Topkapi MS H 1653, discussed above, combines an incomplete Ilkhanid ''Jāmiʿ'' with Timurid additions, which are dated 1425.  Another ''Jāmiʿ'' is in Paris ([[BnF]], Supplément persan 1113), dated to about 1430, with 113 miniatures.  Most of the miniatures for these volumes copy the horizontal format and other features of the Ilkhanid manuscripts, while retaining other features of Timurid style in costume, colouring and composition, using what is sometimes known as the "Historical style".&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Bloom, 58 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies''' is a collection of [[LGBT]] historical materials housed in the Special Collections and Rare Books section of the [[University of Minnesota Libraries]]. It is located underground in the [[Elmer L. Andersen]] special collections facilities on the [[University of Minnesota]]'s Minneapolis campus. The '''Tretter Collection''' houses over 40,000 items, making it one of the largest GLBT history collections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birkey|first1=Andy|title=Tretter Collection Celebrates 10 Years of Preserving LGBT Community|url=http://thecolu.mn/5130/tretter-collection-celebrates-10-years-of-preserving-lgbt-community|website=The Column|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is international in scope and is varied in media.

== Collection ==
Although books are the core of the collection (including a large holding of [[gay pulp fiction]]), substantial sections include textiles, glassware, film, music, art works, and three-dimensional objects such as statuary, event buttons, and furniture.  The collection includes unpublished manuscripts, vertical files, and periodicals in approximately 56 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Log Cabin Will House Its Archival Material at the University of Minnesota's Tretter Collection |url=http://www.georgialogcabin.org/news/Log-Cabin-Republicans-Tretter-Collection-University-Minnesota-Minneapolis/200603011905.shtml |website=Georgia Log Cabin |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lavender Legacies Guide: United States: Minnesota|url=http://www2.archivists.org/groups/lesbian-and-gay-archives-roundtable-lagar/lavender-legacies-guide-united-states-minnesota|website=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the material is from people and organizations in  the [[United States]] during the last third of the twentieth century.

Among the significant archival holdings are:
* items from the [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] estate
* archives of the national [[Log Cabin Republicans]]
* records of the [[Daughters of Bilitis]]
* [[Mattachine Society]] records
* page proofs and layouts for six works by [[Andy Warhol]]
* archives of the [[National Education Association]] GLBT Caucus
* the personal papers of:
** [[Tobias Schneebaum]]
** [[Charles Nolte]]
** [[Stuart Ferguson (author)|Stuart Ferguson]]

The collection was started by [[Jean-Nickolaus Tretter]], a [[Minnesota]]-born archivist in the 1950s, and later donated to the University of Minnesota Libraries.

Selected items from the collection and timelines are frequently assembled and displayed worldwide. Recent displays have been at the [[Motor City Pride]] in Michigan in 2007 and 2009, and the first [[Moscow Pride|Moscow, Russia Pride Festival]] in May, 2006.

In 2005, the collection started its official newsletter, "The Tretter Letter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://special.lib.umn.edu/rare/tretter/tretterletterjan07.pdf |title=Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts |publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315164357/http://special.lib.umn.edu/rare/tretter/tretterletterjan07.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, The Tretter Collection, the University of Minnesota Libraries, and the [[Quatrefoil Library]] presented the first GLBT ALMS ([[Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections]]) Conference in Minneapolis, MN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=GLBT ALMS 2006 Conference Program|url=|journal=GLBT ALMS 2006 Conference Program|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2006/05/24/andersen-library-hosts-international-glbt-materials-archiving-conferenc|title=Anderson Library Hosts International GLBT Materials Archiving Conference|last=Cook|first=Elizabeth|date=2006-05-24|website=Minnesota Daily|publisher=Minnesota Daily|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Quatrefoil Library|last=Keim|first=Adam|publisher=Friends of the Bill of Rights Foundation|year=2008|isbn=9780966882827|location=Golden Valley, MN|pages=104-105|chapter=Chapter 7 : In conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is the home of the groundbreaking Transgender Oral History Project, which has gathered 200 video interviews of transgender individuals primarily in the Upper Midwest, and which has received funding for a second phase.

== Awards, honors and media recognition ==
In 2016, The Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection was the inaugural recipient of the [http://www.ala.org/rt/glbtrt/awards/newlen-symons-award-excellence-serving-glbt-community Newlen-Symons Award] for Excellence in Library Services and Outreach to the GLBT Community.

"The Newlen-Symons Award recognizes the tremendous impact of the Tretter Collection and its leadership in collecting and preserving the record of the GLBT community, from the University of Minnesota campus and beyond," said ALA President Sari Feldman. "Through preservation, collection development and advocacy, the Tretter Collection embodies how libraries can transform lives and communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2016/01/glbtrt-selects-jean-nickolaus-tretter-collection-university-minnesota|title=GLBTRT selects the Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection at the University of Minnesota Libraries for the Newlen-Symons Award for Excellence|last=HCHO|date=2016-01-15|work=News and Press Center|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, The Tretter Collection won the Diversity Award presented by the [[Society of American Archivists]].

On the film [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], films that have exclusively positive reviews and have been reviewed by at least five [[critic]]s have a 100% approval rating.

           After the 3rd AfD and the subsequent discussion (January 2018),
                current consensus now states that ONLY films with a
              Rotten Tomatoes Critics Consensus or at least 20 reviews 
                               are to be included.
         Do NOT add films without a Critics Consensus or at least 20 reviews.
      Remove any films that have no Critics Consensus AND fewer than 20 reviews.

'''The Locksmith's House''' (formerly '''Willenhall Lock Museum''') is a [[museum]] in [[Willenhall]], England. The premises, on New Road, consist of a house and backyard workshops, typical of the many family run lock making businesses which once thrived in the town. The house itself was built in 1840, but the period interiors date to 1904,&lt;ref name=lock&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Locksmiths House|publisher=Wolverhampton Local History|accessdate=13 December 2011|authorlink=The History of the Locksmiths House}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Hodson lock making family first lived there. Lock making skills are demonstrated by volunteers using original tools and equipment, such as the floor press and belt driven machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lock Museum, Willenhall|url=http://www.iarecordings.org/features/lockmuseum.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lock Museum was opened to the public in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/Museum/locks/History2.htm|title=Willenhall Lock Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, it has been owned and managed by the [[Black Country Living Museum]].

==The buildings==
The house and its adjoining workshops and outbuildings were awarded Grade II listed status by [[English Heritage]] in 1984 and 1986. The listed structures include the two storey workshop on the East side of the yard&lt;ref name="BLB east"&gt;{{cite web|last=English Heritage|title=British Listed Buildings: workshops on East side of 54|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-219126-workshops-on-east-side-of-yard-at-rear-o|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus the single storey workshop (originally a stamping shop) on the West side of the yard, directly adjoining the back of the house.&lt;ref name="BLB 54"&gt;{{cite web|last=English Heritage|title=British Listed Buildings: No 54 and workshops|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-219125-number-54-and-workshops-attached-to-rear|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Richard Hodson &amp; Sons==

The business of Richard Hodson &amp; Sons was established in 1792, according to the firm's letterhead. In 1893, it was taken on by John Hodson, who later passed it to his son Edgar.&lt;ref name=lock /&gt; The Hodsons specialised in bar padlocks and also in lighter locks - these locks would have been used to secure cargo on a [[lighter (barge)|lighter]]. Lock parts were manufactured and assembled in the two storey workshop behind the house. Completed orders would have been brought into the yard and loaded into carts. From here they could have been sent all over the world, by rail or via the extensive [[BCN Main Line|Midlands canal network]] and on to coastal ports. Hodson locks were certainly exported to South America and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hodson Archive newsletter 2010|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/downloads/lh-newsletter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Drapers' Shop==

From the 1920s, the front room of the Locksmith's House was run as a drapers' shop by two of Edgar Hodson's sisters, Edith and Flora. [[The Hodson Shop]] operated until 1971, and the unsold stock forms a rich resource on working class costume, now in the care of [[Walsall Museum]].

==The Lock Gallery==

There is a wide variety of locks and keys on display in the gallery, many of which were made in Willenhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/media/locations/library/lh-history.pdf|title=Locks from Willenhall|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Low'sEncyclopedia.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''Low's Encyclopædia'']]

'''''Low's Encyclopædia''''' is an early American [[encyclopedia]], titled ''The New and Complete American Encyclopædia or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences''. It was published in [[New York City]], from 1805 to 1811. Consisting of seven volumes [[quarto]], it is noteworthy among America's earliest encyclopedias for having been written in the [[United States]], as opposed to being an American reprint of a British work, as were, for examples, ''[[Dobson's Encyclopedia]]'' (1789 to 1798), the [[William Bradford (American Revolutionary printer)|Bradford]] printing (1806 to 1820) of ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' (1802 to 1820), [[Samuel A. Mitchell]]'s American printing (1816) of the ''[[British Encyclopaedia]]'' (1809), or the Birch and Small printing ([[Willich|A. F. M. Willich]] and [[James Mease]], [[Philadelphia]], 1803) of the ''[[Domestic Encyclopedia]]'' (A. F. M. Willich, London, 1802).

==History==
The first five volumes of the encyclopedia were published by John Low (1763-1809), and the final two by his widow and successor, Esther Prentiss Low (1762-1816). John Low was born in [[London]] and immigrated to America with Esther shortly after the birth of their son John (ca. 1790–1829). By 1795, John Low had established himself as a printer and bookseller in [[New York City]]. Upon his death, Esther ran their printing establishment, and the younger John Low carried on in the printing business.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Sanford A. ''The Low Family of New York City: Publishers, 1795–1829'' (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKay, George J. ''A Register of Artists, Engravers, Booksellers, Bookbinders, Printers &amp; Publishers in New York City, 1633–1820'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Public Advertiser'' (May 25, 1809)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Longworth's New York Directory'' (1812), p.190; (1813), p.207; (1828), p.380.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued issuing the encyclopedia and printing maps posthumously until at least 1831.&lt;ref name=sloan&gt;[http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A22/item-map-low-ga-1831.html "Auction 22"] on the ''Dorothy Sloan - Books'' website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2008-171987 "Identites: Low, Esther Prentiss 1762-1816"] on [[WorldCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Low's Encyclopedia.JPG|thumb|left|267px|''Low's Encyclopædia'', 1805-1811]]

== Content ==
''Low's Encyclopedia'' is primarily an American work. Although the title page says it was taken from the ''[[Encyclopædia Perthensis]]'', this does not appear to be the case, as this work is seven volumes of around 650 pages each, while the latter work was 23 volumes of 800 pages each. Many of the minor definitional entries are borrowed from ''Perthensis'' or ''Britannica'', usually with changes in wording, but a roughly equal number are original, and the articles are disproportionately of American concern: [[London]] takes up half a page while New York City gets five, when populations at the time were nearly 1 million for the former city and 80,000 for the latter. By comparison, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'''s fourth edition of 1810 gives the two cities 42 pages versus one and one half, respectively. [[Scotland]] receives four pages, while each of the [[U.S. state|states of the United States]] get equally long articles, and most maps are of the various states. The [[American Revolutionary War]] gets a 30-page treatment, while the [[Glorius revolution|British revolution]] of 1688 gets a paragraph. The article "New York" describes [[Sir William Johnson]] as being a land jobber and an enemy of the nation, for example.

Almost every American [[City (United States)|city]], [[Township (United States)|town]], and [[County (United States)|county]] is listed, there are many biographies of Americans, and all the maps and most of the plates are original, a few plates being taken from ''Britannica''. They are found with an inconsistent number of maps, usually around 30, and plates. Although the title page says there would be 170 copperplates, the copy in the [[Library of Congress]] only has 149. Most of the maps appear to have been published earlier by John Low; many are dated 1799 and 1800, and some appear to be even older. The map of [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] calls Kentucky a state, but Tennessee was called [[Southwest Territory|Southwestern Territory]]. This dates the map to the mid-1790s. It is known that John Low published and sold [[John Payne (geographer)|John Payne]]'s ''A New and Complete System of Universal Geography'' in 1798-1800, with maps that re-appeared in this encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=sloan /&gt; From this we can credit Payne as cartographer for the maps which were not updated for the encyclopedia except in the inscriptions, which say "Engraved for the New Encyclopedia" where "Engraved for Payne's Universal Geography" had been. Other maps are newer, such as Pennsylvania, dated 1810, which was engraved and published by Esther Low. A reprint of the encyclopedia by Esther between 1811 and 1815 includes some new maps.

== Production and authorship ==
Plans for the encyclopedia were begun, and subscriptions began being taken, much earlier than the original publication date, as it is known that around 1802, [[Thomas Jefferson]] subscribed to a set, which was delivered in 1811 for $75.&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/search/Correspondent%3A%22Low%2C%20John%22%20Correspondent%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22 "Correspondent:'Low, John' Correspondent:'Jefferson, Thomas'] on the ''Founder's Online'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Its intention was to compete with ''Dobson's Encyclopedia'', as stated in the "Preface", which was written in 1811 by Esther Low:

[[File:LowesMap.jpg|thumb|375px|Map of United States. After the statehood of Tennessee (1796) but before that of Ohio (1803)]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The motive that produced the publication of this Encyclopædia originated in the general voice of a numerous class of readers; who, although they might have been ever so anxious for the promulgation of literature, were yet induced to express their regret, that another similar work which had been published at [[Philadelphia]], was of too voluminous and expensive a nature to answer the beneficial purposes of a general circulation. To remedy this complaint, they chose to decide in favor of another compilation; which, whilst it should embrace all the utility without the diffuseness of the former, would nevertheless, prove equally interesting, and at the same time more conveniently portable, and might be procured at nearly one-fourth of the expense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No author or editor is mentioned in the preface, only:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...although it may be considered as a compilation of all the best dictionaries and books of science extant, yet it may justly claim in other respects, a right to originality; as a vast mass of matter has been generously supplied by men of the first eminence in the various pursuits of literature, as well natives of America as foreigners of distinction; who were well versed in the Mathematical, Theological, Physical, and other departments. To enumerate their names would be impracticable in the present instance, and to particularise (sic) any, might be thought invidious; they are all of them entitled to the warmest thanks of the publishers for their communications on the several topics on which they have so ably written. The Geographical, Botanical, and Chemical parts are nearly all original; as well as those of Agriculture, Gardening, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Malet Street''' is a street in [[Bloomsbury]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], [[Central London]], [[England]]. It runs between [[Torrington Place]] and the [[British Museum]], parallel to [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] and [[Tottenham Court Road]].

==History==
The street is named after Sir [[Edward Malet]] who was married to Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of [[Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford]] who owned much of the surrounding area.

'''Mari''', also called Mari Urraca, Anbotoko Mari ("the lady of [[Anboto]]"), and Murumendiko Dama ("lady of [[Murumendi]]") was a [[goddess]]—a ''[[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamia]]''—of the [[Basque people|Basques]]. She was married to the [[deity|god]] [[Sugaar]] (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travelled together [[hail]] would fall, her departures from her cave would be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lived in at different times would determine dry or wet weather: wet when she was in [[Anboto]]; dry when she was elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she was said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of [[Gurutzegorri]] ([[Ataun]]), [[Aizkorri]] and [[Aralar Range|Aralar]], although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered to pertain to the same lamia{{fact|date=September 2016}}.

== Etymology ==
It is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;This derives from articles in the ''Enciclopedia General Ilustrada del Pais Vasco'' ''[[Encyclopedia Auñamendi]]'', which in turn cite ''Euskalerriaren Yakintza'', Tomo I "Costumbres y supersticiones", by folklorist [[Resurrección María de Azkue]] (1864-1951). It notes that additional legends were recorded by [[Jose Miguel Barandiaran]] and [[Juan Thalamas Labandibar]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first known written citation of the "Dame of Amboto" was made by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s chronicler [[Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa]] in his [[Memorial histórico español]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa]], ''Memorial histórico español: colección de documentos, opúsculos y antigüedades'', Tomo VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs associated with Mari==
[[Image:Amboto 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Anboto is one of the mountains where Mari is supposed to live]]

Mari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort [[Sugaar]] meet every Friday (the night of the ''[[Akelarre (witchcraft)|Akelarre]]'' or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of ''[[sorginak]]'' (witches), and is said to feed "on the negation and affirmation" (that is, on falsehood).

Occasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (''[[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamiak]]'', ''[[jentilak]]'', etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields.

In various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, [[Atxular]] and [[Mikelatz]]. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the [[Devil]] in a church in [[Salamanca]] and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, [[Hodei]], or embodied as a young red bull.

Another legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of [[Biscay]], [[Diego López I de Haro]]. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the [[sign of the cross]]. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose.

Other legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way.

The people of [[Oñati]] believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in [[Aloña]]. In [[Zeanuri]], [[Biscay]], they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in [[Oiz]] called [[Supelegor]]. A similar legend in [[Olaeta]], Biscay substitutes [[Gorbea]] for Supelegor.

A legend from [[Otxandio]], Biscay tells that Mari was born in [[Lazkao]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and that she was the evil sister of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]].  In other legends, the priest is her cousin [[Juanito Chistu]], rather than a brother, and is a great hunter.  She was said to take a [[distaff]] by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake.

In [[Elorrieta]], Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of [[sin]].

Folklorist [[Resurrección María de Azkue]] ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the [[Merindad de Durango]].  She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto.  According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his ''Historia de Vizcaya.'' Labayru in her ''Historia de Vizcaya'' doubts it.

Legends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a [[witch]] for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about.  In [[Beizama]], Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented.  They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, ''"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo"'' ("Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven").&lt;ref&gt;The meaning of "Murua" is obscure, but it might perhaps refer to the small village of {{ill|Murua, Spain|lt=Murua|eu|Murua}} near Beizama. It may be impossible to be certain.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier |title=Basque Mythology: History of the myths and deities of the Basque Mythology |date=2018 |location=Euskadi Public Reading Network / Google |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Basque_Mythology_History_of_the_myths_and_deities_?id=vlpZDwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=en_US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mari was associated with various forces of nature, including [[thunder]] and [[wind]].  As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with [[Lurbira]].

Mari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch.  She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her [[Cult image|idols]] usually feature a full [[moon]] behind her head.

Mari is the main character of [[Basque mythology]], having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat.

==Christianization==
[[Saint Marina of Aguas Santas|Santa Marina]], a saint revered in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth.

The most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
According to the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[creation myth|cosmogony]], '''Mashya''' and '''Mashyana''' were the first man and woman whose procreation gave rise to the human race.

==Etymology==
The names are from [[Avestan]], nominally transliterated as ''{{lang|ae|mašyā}}'' and ''{{lang|ae|mašyānē}}'', but like other Avestan words also, spellings (and hence transliterations) vary from manuscript to manuscript. ''{{lang|ae|Mašyā}}'' may thus also appear as ''{{lang|ae|maṣ̌iiā}}'' or ''{{lang|ae|maš́iiā}}'' or ''{{lang|ae|mašiiāi}}'' (and variants).

Originally and etymologically, ''{{lang|ae|Mašyā}}'' means "mortal being" as Old Persian ''martya'', Persian ''mard'' and even Sanskrit ''martya'' also mean "mortal" and therefore "man". The root in Avesta and Sanskrit for death is ''mar'', ''mr'', "to die". The causative ''mâr'' means "to kill". Its derivatives ''merethyu''/''mrtyu'' means "death"; ''mareta'' and ''maretan'' means "mortal", and then "man, human being" ''mashya''. For more on the etymology of the ''aša'' and ''arta'' variants of these terms, see [[Avestan phonology#sh-rt|Avestan phonology]].

==Attestations==
According to the [[creation myth]] as described in the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', Ohrmuzd's ([[Ahura Mazda]]) sixth creation is the primeval beast Gayomart ([[Keyumars|Gayamarətan]]), who was neither male nor female. Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]), the Spirit of Evil that dwelt in the Absolute Darkness, sought to destroy all that Ohrmuzd had created, and sent the demoness Jeh ([[Jahi]]) to kill Gayomard. In this she was successful, but the moon ([[Mah]]) captured his seed before the animal died, from which all animal life then grew. From Gayomard's corpse grew a tree, the seeds of which were the origin of all plant life, and from the branches of which grew Mashya and Mashyana.

They promised to aid Ohrmuzd in his battle with Ahriman, and gave birth to fifteen sets of twins which scattered around the Earth and became the races of mankind.

==Theories==
Indo-European connections to [[Ask and Embla]] have been proposed. In [[Norse mythology]], Ask and Embla were the first man and woman, created from trees and given various gifts of life by three gods. According to [[Benjamin Thorpe]] "[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assidous labour; the same relation as Meshia and Meshiane, the ancient Persian names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees."&lt;ref name=THORPE337&gt;Thorpe (1907:337).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43050">'''Monotone comparative statics''' is a sub-field of [[comparative statics]] that focuses on the conditions under which endogenous variables undergo monotone changes (that is, either increasing or decreasing) when there is a change in the exogenous parameters.  Traditionally, comparative results in economics are obtained using the [[Implicit Function Theorem]], an approach that requires the concavity and differentiability of the objective function as well as the interiority and uniqueness of the optimal solution. The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the endogenous variable and exogenous parameter. Roughly speaking, a maximization problem displays complementarity if a higher value of the exogenous parameter increases the marginal return of the endogenous variable. This guarantees that the set of solutions to the optimization problem is increasing with respect to the exogenous parameter.

== Basic results ==

=== Motivation ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot; s):X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of functions parameterized by &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(S, \geq_S)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partially ordered set]] (or poset, for short). How does the [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]] &lt;math&gt;\arg\max\limits_{x\in X}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; vary with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;?

'''Standard comparative statics approach:''' Assume that set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact interval and &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot;s)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuously [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], strictly [[quasiconcave]] function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the unique maximizer of &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot;s)&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;f'(\bar{x}(s);s') \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;s'&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, which guarantees that &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. This guarantees that the optimum has shifted to the right, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}(s')\geq \bar{x}(s)&lt;/math&gt;. This approach makes various assumptions, most notably the quasiconcavity of &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot;s)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== One-dimensional optimization problems ===

While it is clear what it means for a unique optimal solution to be increasing, it is not immediately clear what it means for the correspondence &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; to be increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.  The standard definition adopted by the literature is the following.

'''Definition (strong set order):'''&lt;ref&gt;See Veinott (1992): ''Lattice programming: qualitative optimization and equilibria''. MS Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; be subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; dominates &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in the ''strong set order''  (&lt;math&gt;Y'\geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt;) if for any &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\max\{x',x\}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\min\{x',x\}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, if &lt;math&gt;Y:=\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y':=\{x'\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;Y' \geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x' \geq x&lt;/math&gt;.  The correspondence &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be increasing if &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}f(x;s')\geq_{SSO} \arg\max_{x\in X}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s'&gt;_S s&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of complementarity between exogenous and endogenous variables is formally captured by single crossing differences.

'''Definition (single crossing function):''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a ''single crossing function'' if for any &lt;math&gt;s' \geq_S s&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\phi (s)\geq (&gt;) \ 0  \ \Rightarrow \ \phi (s')\geq (&gt;) \ 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition (single crossing differences):'''&lt;ref&gt;See Milgrom, P., and C. Shannon (1994): “Monotone Comparative Statics,” ''Econometrica'', 62(1), 157–180; or Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2012): “Aggregating the Single Crossing Property,” ''Econometrica'', 80(5), 2333–2348.&lt;/ref&gt; The family of functions &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f:X \times S\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, obey ''single crossing differences'' (or satisfy the single ''crossing property'') if for all &lt;math&gt;x' \geq x&lt;/math&gt;, function &lt;math&gt;\Delta(s)= f(x' ;s)-f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function.

Obviously, an increasing function is a single crossing function and, if &lt;math&gt;\Delta (s)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (in the above definition, for any &lt;math&gt;x'&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;), we say that &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey ''increasing differences''. Unlike increasing differences, single crossing differences is an ''ordinal property'', i.e., if &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey single crossing differences, then so do &lt;math&gt;\{g(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(x;s)=H(f(x;s);s)&lt;/math&gt; for some function &lt;math&gt;H(\cdot;s)&lt;/math&gt; that is  strictly increasing in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1:'''&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom, P., and C. Shannon (1994): “Monotone Comparative Statics,” ''Econometrica'', 62(1), 157–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Define &lt;math&gt;F_{Y}(s):=\arg\max_{x \in Y} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. The family &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey single crossing differences if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;F_{ Y}( s ' ) \geq_{ SSO } F_{Y}( s )&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;s' \geq_S s&lt;/math&gt;.

:''Proof:'' Assume &lt;math&gt;s' \geq_S s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in F_{Y}(s)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x' \in F_{Y}(s')&lt;/math&gt;.  We have to show that &lt;math&gt;\max\{ x' , x \}\in F_{Y}(s')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\min\{ x ', x \} \in F_{Y}(s)&lt;/math&gt;. We only need to consider the case where &lt;math&gt;x&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.   Since &lt;math&gt;x \in F_{Y}(s)&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;f(x;s)\geq f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt;, which guarantees that &lt;math&gt;x\in F_{Y'}(s')&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;f(x;s)=f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x' \in F_Y(s)&lt;/math&gt;.  If not, &lt;math&gt;f(x;s)&gt;f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt; which implies (by single crossing differences) that &lt;math&gt;f(x;s')&gt;f(x';s')&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the optimality of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;s'&lt;/math&gt;. To show the necessity of single crossing differences, set &lt;math&gt;Y:=\{x,\bar{x}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} \geq x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F_{Y}(s') \geq_{SSO} F_{Y}(s)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;s' \geq_S s&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that, if &lt;math&gt;f(\bar{x};s) \geq (&gt;) \ f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\bar{x}; s') \geq (&gt;) \ f(x;s')&lt;/math&gt;. ''Q.E.D.''

'''Application (monopoly output and changes in costs):''' A monopolist chooses &lt;math&gt;x \in X\subseteq \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; to maximise its profit &lt;math&gt;\Pi(x;-c)=xP(x)-cx&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P:\mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse demand function and &lt;math&gt;c\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant marginal cost. Note that &lt;math&gt;\{\Pi(\cdot,-c)\}_{(-c) \in \mathbb{R}_{-}}&lt;/math&gt; obey single crossing differences. Indeed, take any &lt;math&gt;x' \geq x&lt;/math&gt; and assume that &lt;math&gt;x'P(x')-cx' \geq (&gt;) \ xP(x)-cx&lt;/math&gt;; for any &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;(-c')\geq (-c)&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;x'P(x')-c'x' \geq (&gt;) \ xP(x)-c'x&lt;/math&gt;. By Theorem 1, the profit-maximizing output decreases as the marginal cost of output increases, i.e., as &lt;math&gt;(-c)&lt;/math&gt; decreases.

=== Interval dominance order ===

Single crossing differences is not a necessary condition for the optimal solution to be increasing with respect to a parameter. In fact, the condition is necessary only for &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x \in Y}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; to be increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for ''any'' &lt;math&gt;Y\subset X&lt;/math&gt;. Once the sets are restricted to a narrower class of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the single crossing differences condition is no longer necessary.

'''Definition (Interval):'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  A set &lt;math&gt;Y \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is an ''interval'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if, whenever &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{**}&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, then any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x^* \leq x \leq x^{**} &lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;X= \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is an interval of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,4\}&lt;/math&gt;. Denote &lt;math&gt;[x^*,x^{**}]=\{x\in X \ | \ x^*\leq x\leq x^{**}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition (Interval Dominance Order):'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The family &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey the ''interval dominance order'' (IDO) if for any &lt;math&gt;x''&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s'\geq_S s&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x'';s)\geq f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [x',x'']&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f(x'';s) \geq (&gt;) \ f(x';s) \ \Rightarrow  \ f(x'';s')\geq (&gt;) \ f(x';s')&lt;/math&gt;.

Like single crossing differences, the interval dominance order (IDO) is an ordinal property.  An example of an IDO family is a family of quasiconcave functions &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}f(x,s)&lt;/math&gt; increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.  Such a family need not obey single crossing differences.

A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\times S \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is ''regular'' if &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x \in [x^*, x^{**}]}f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty for any &lt;math&gt;x^{**}\geq x^*&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;[x^*,x^{**}]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the interval &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X \ | \ x^*\leq x\leq x^{**}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2:'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Denote &lt;math&gt;F_Y(s):=\arg\max_{x\in Y} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. A family of regular functions &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obeys the interval dominance order if and only if &lt;math&gt;F_Y(s)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for all intervals &lt;math&gt;Y \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;.

:''Proof:'' To show the sufficiency of IDO, take any two &lt;math&gt;s' \geq_S s&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that &lt;math&gt;x' \in F_Y(s)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;x'' \in F_Y(s')&lt;/math&gt;. We only need to consider the case where &lt;math&gt;x' &gt; x''&lt;/math&gt;. By definition &lt;math&gt;f(x';s) \geq f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [x'', x'] \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, by IDO we have &lt;math&gt;f(x';s') \geq f(x'';s')&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x' \in F_Y(s')&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, it must be that &lt;math&gt;f(x';s) = f(x'';s)&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, i.e., if &lt;math&gt;f(x';s) &gt; f(x'';s)&lt;/math&gt;, then by IDO we have &lt;math&gt;f(x';s') &gt; f(x'';s')&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts that &lt;math&gt;x'' \in F_Y(s')&lt;/math&gt;. To show the necessity of IDO, assume that there is an interval &lt;math&gt;[x'',x']&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x';s) \geq f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [x'',x']&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;x' \in \arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. There are two possible violations  of IDO.  One possibility is that &lt;math&gt;f(x'';s') &gt; f(x'; s')&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, by the regularity of &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot; s')&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s')&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty but does not contain &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; which is impossible since &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; increases in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Another possible violation of IDO occurs if &lt;math&gt;f(x'';s') = f(x';s')&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f(x'';s) &lt; f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the set &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s')&lt;/math&gt; either contains &lt;math&gt;x''&lt;/math&gt;, which is not possible since &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; increases in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (note that in this case &lt;math&gt;x'' \not \in \arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s')&lt;/math&gt;) or it does not contain &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, which also violates monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in [x'',x']} f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. ''Q.E.D.''

The next result gives useful sufficient conditions for single crossing differences and IDO.

'''Proposition 1:'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an interval of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of continuously differentiable functions. (i) If, for any &lt;math&gt;s'\geq_S s&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(x;s')\geq \alpha f'(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey single crossing differences.  (ii)  If, for any &lt;math&gt;s'\geq_S s&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a nondecreasing, strictly positive function &lt;math&gt;\alpha: X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(x;s')\geq \alpha(x)f'(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obey IDO.

'''Application (Optimal stopping problem):'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992; and Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2013): “Discounting, Values, and Decisions,” ''Journal of Political Economy'', 121(5), 896-939.&lt;/ref&gt; At each moment in time, agent gains profit of &lt;math&gt;\pi (t)&lt;/math&gt;, which can be positive or negative. If agent decides to stop at time &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the present value of his accumulated profit is

:&lt;math&gt;V(x;-r )=\int_0^x e^{-r t}\pi (t) dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the discount rate. Since &lt;math&gt;V'(x;-r)=e^{-r x}\pi (x)&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has many turning points and they do not vary with the discount rate. We claim that the optimal stopping time is decreasing in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., if &lt;math&gt;r' &gt; r &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\geq 0}V(x;-r) \geq_{SSO} \arg\max_{x \geq 0}V(x;-r')&lt;/math&gt;. Take any &lt;math&gt;r'&lt; r&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;V'(x;-r)=e^{-rx} \pi(x) = e^{(r'-r)x}V'(x;-r').&lt;/math&gt;  Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha (x)=e^{(r'-r)x}&lt;/math&gt; is positive and increasing, Proposition 1 says that &lt;math&gt;\{V(\cdot;-r)\}_{(-r) &lt;0}&lt;/math&gt; obey IDO and, by Theorem 2, the set of optimal stopping times is decreasing.

=== Multi-dimensional optimization problems ===

The above results can be extended to a multi-dimensional setting. Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\geq_X)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]. For any two &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we denote their [[supremum]] (or ''least upper bound'', or join) by &lt;math&gt;x'\vee x&lt;/math&gt; and their [[infimum]] (or ''greatest lower bound'', or  meet) by &lt;math&gt;x'\wedge x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition (Strong Set Order):'''&lt;ref&gt;See Veinott (1992): ''Lattice programming: qualitative optimization and equilibria''. MS Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\geq_X)&lt;/math&gt; be a lattice and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt;  be subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; dominates &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in the ''strong set order'' (&lt;math&gt;Y'\geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt; ) if for any &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;x\vee x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\wedge x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of the strong set order in higher dimensions.
* Let &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y:=[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y':=[ a' , b' ]&lt;/math&gt; be some closed intervals in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly &lt;math&gt;(X, \geq)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; is the standard ordering on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is a lattice. Therefore, as it was shown in the previous section &lt;math&gt;Y' \geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a' \geq a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b' \geq b&lt;/math&gt;;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y' \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be some [[hyperrectangle]]s. That is, there exist some vectors &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y:=\{x \in X \ | \ a \leq x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y':=\{x \in X \ | \ a' \leq x \leq b'\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; is the natural, coordinate-wise ordering on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;(X, \geq)&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;Y' \geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a' \geq a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b' \geq b&lt;/math&gt;;
* Let &lt;math&gt;(X, \geq_X)&lt;/math&gt; be a space of all [[probability distributions]] with support being a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, endowed with the first order [[stochastic dominance]] order &lt;math&gt;\geq_X&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;(X, \geq_X)&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice. Let &lt;math&gt;Y:=\Delta([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y':=\Delta([ a' , b' ])&lt;/math&gt; denote sets of probability distributions with support &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[ a' , b' ]&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Then, &lt;math&gt;Y' \geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\geq_X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a'\geq a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b' \geq b&lt;/math&gt;.

Shannon (1994): “Monotone Comparative Statics,” ''Econometrica'', 62(1), 157–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\geq_X)&lt;/math&gt; be a lattice. The function &lt;math&gt;f:X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is ''quasisupermodular'' (QSM) if

&lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq (&gt;) \ f(x\wedge x') \ \Rightarrow \ f(x\vee x')\geq (&gt;) \ f(x').&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a [[supermodular function]] if &lt;math&gt;f(x\vee x')- f(x')\geq f(x) - f(x\wedge x').&lt;/math&gt;  Every supermodular function is quasisupermodular.  As in the case of single crossing differences, and unlike supermodularity, quasisupermodularity is an ordinal property. That is, if function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is quasisupermodular, then so is function &lt;math&gt;g:=H \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is some strictly increasing function.

Since &lt;math&gt;x \in F_Y(s)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y' \geq_{SSO} Y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x;s) \geq f(x'\wedge x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. By quasisupermodularity, &lt;math&gt;f(x'\vee x;s) \geq f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt;, and by the single crossing differences, &lt;math&gt;f(x'\vee x;s') \geq f(x';s')&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;x'\vee x \in F_{Y'}(s')&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume that &lt;math&gt;x'\wedge x \not\in F_{Y}(s)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f(x;s)&gt;f(x'\wedge x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. By quasisupermodularity, &lt;math&gt;f(x'\vee x;s)&gt;f(x';s)&lt;/math&gt;, and by single crossing differences &lt;math&gt;f(x'\vee x;s')&gt;f(x';s')&lt;/math&gt;.

(1979): “Equilibrium Points in Nonzero-Sum n-Person Submodular Games,” ''SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization'', 17, 773–787.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denote the vector of inputs (drawn from a sublattice &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{l}_+&lt;/math&gt;) of a profit-maximizing firm, &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^{l}_{++}&lt;/math&gt; be the vector of input prices, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the revenue function mapping input vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to revenue (in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\{\Pi (\cdot; p)\}_{p \in \mathbb{R}_{++}^l}&lt;/math&gt; has increasing differences (and so it obeys single crossing differences). Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is supermodular, then so is &lt;math&gt;\Pi(\cdot; p)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, it is quasisupermodular and by Theorem 3, &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}\Pi (x;p) \geq_{SSO} \arg\max_{x\in X}\Pi (x;p')&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p'\geq p&lt;/math&gt;.

== Constrained optimization problems ==

In some important economic applications, the relevant change in the constraint set cannot be easily understood as an increase with respect to the strong set order and so Theorem 3 cannot be easily applied. For example, consider a consumer who maximizes a utility function &lt;math&gt;u: X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; subject to a budget constraint. At price &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{++}^n&lt;/math&gt; and wealth &lt;math&gt;w&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, his budget set is &lt;math&gt;B(p, w) = \{x \in  X \ | \ p\cdot x \leq w\}&lt;/math&gt; and his demand set at &lt;math&gt;(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is (by definition) &lt;math&gt;D(p, w) = \arg\max_{x \in B(p,w)} u(x)&lt;/math&gt;. A basic property of consumer demand is normality, which means (in the case where demand is unique) that the demand of each good is increasing in wealth.   Theorem 3 cannot be straightforwardly applied to obtain conditions for normality, because &lt;math&gt;B(p,w')\not\geq_{SSO} B(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;w'&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (when &lt;math&gt;\geq_{SSO}&lt;/math&gt; is derived from the Euclidean order).  In this case, the following result holds.

'''Theorem 4:'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H. (2007): “The Comparative Statics of Constrained Optimization Problems,” ''Econometrica'', 75(2), 401–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;u:\mathbb{R}_{++}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is supermodular and concave. Then the demand correspondence is normal in the following sense: suppose &lt;math&gt;w''&gt;w'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x''\in D(p,w'')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'\in D(p,w')&lt;/math&gt;; then there is &lt;math&gt;z''\in D(p,w'')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'\in D(p,w')&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z''\geq x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x''\geq z'&lt;/math&gt;.

The supermodularity of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; alone guarantees that, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(x\wedge y)-u(y)\geq u(x)-u(x \vee y)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the four points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\wedge y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x\vee y&lt;/math&gt; form a rectangle in Euclidean space (in the sense that &lt;math&gt;x\wedge y-x=y-x\vee y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x-x\vee y=x\wedge y-y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x\wedge y-x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x-x\vee y&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal).  On the other hand, supermodularity and concavity together guarantee that
&lt;math&gt; u( x \vee y - \lambda v)-u(y)\geq u(x)- u( x \wedge y + \lambda v).&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v = y - x\wedge y= x\vee y - x&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, crucially, the four points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \vee y - \lambda v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x \wedge y + \lambda v&lt;/math&gt; form a backward-leaning parallelogram in Euclidean space.

== Monotone comparative statics under uncertainty ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of real-valued functions defined on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order. Theorem 1 and 3 tell us that &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}f(x,;s)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.  Interpreting &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the world, this says that the optimal action is increasing in the state if the state is known. Suppose, however, that the action &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is taken before &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is realized; then it seems reasonable that the optimal action should increase with the likelihood of higher states.  To capture this notion formally, let &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda (\cdot; t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of density functions parameterized by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the poset &lt;math&gt;(T,\geq_T)&lt;/math&gt;, where higher &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is associated with a higher likelihood of higher states, either in the sense of first order stochastic dominance or the [[monotone likelihood ratio]] property.   Choosing under uncertainty, the agent maximizes

:&lt;math&gt;F(x;t)=\int_{S} f(x;s)\,\lambda (s;t)\,ds.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X}F(x;t)&lt;/math&gt; to be increasing in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices (by Theorems 1 and 2) that family &lt;math&gt;\{F(\cdot;t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order.  The results in this section give condition under which this holds.

'''Theorem 5:''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(S\subseteq \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;  obeys increasing differences. If &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda (\cdot; t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; is ordered with respect to first order stochastic dominance, then  &lt;math&gt;\{F(\cdot;t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; obeys increasing differences.

:''Proof:'' For any &lt;math&gt;x', x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\phi(s):= f(x';s) - f(x;s)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;F(x';t) - F(x;t) = \int_{S} [f(x';s) - f(x;s)]\lambda (s; t) ds &lt;/math&gt;,  or equivalently &lt;math&gt;F(x';t) - F(x;t) =  \int_{S} \phi(s)\lambda (s; t)ds&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; obeys increasing differences, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and first order stochastic dominance guarantees &lt;math&gt;F(x';t) - F(x;t)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  ''Q.E.D.''

In the following theorem, '''X''' can be either ``single crossing differences" or ``the interval dominance order".

'''Theorem 6:'''&lt;ref&gt;See Athey, S. (2002): “Monotone Comparative Statics Under Uncertainty,” ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 117(1), 187–223; for the case of single crossing differences and Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2009): “Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order,” ''Econometrica'', 77(6), 1949–1992; for the case of IDO.&lt;/ref&gt;  Suppose &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;)  obeys '''X'''.  Then the family &lt;math&gt;\{F(\cdot;t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; obeys '''X''' if &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda (\cdot; t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; is ordered with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.

The monotone likelihood ratio condition in this theorem cannot be weakened, as the next result demonstrates.

'''Proposition 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\cdot;t')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\cdot;t)&lt;/math&gt; be two probability mass functions defined on &lt;math&gt;S := \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}&lt;/math&gt; and suppose &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\cdot;t'')&lt;/math&gt; is does not dominate &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\cdot;t')&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property. Then there is a family of functions &lt;math&gt;\{f(\cdot;s)\}_{s \in S}&lt;/math&gt;, defined on &lt;math&gt;X\subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, that obey single crossing differences, such that &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\in X} F(x; t'') &lt; \arg\max_{x\in X} F(x; t')&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F(x;t)=\sum_{s\in S}\lambda (s,t)f(x,s)&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;t=t',\, t''&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Application (Optimal portfolio problem):''' An agent maximizes expected utility with the strictly increasing Bernoulli utility function &lt;math&gt;u:\mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  (Concavity is not assumed, so we allow the agent to be risk loving.) The wealth of the agent, &lt;math&gt;w&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, can be invested in a safe or risky asset. The prices of the two assets are normalized at 1. The safe asset gives a constant return &lt;math&gt;R\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, while the return of the risky asset &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is governed by the
probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\lambda(s; t)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denote the agent's investment in the risky asset. Then the wealth of the agent in state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(w-x)R+xs&lt;/math&gt;. The agent chooses &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to maximize

:&lt;math&gt;V(x;t):=\int_S u((w-x)R + xs)\lambda(s;t) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\{\hat u(\cdot; s)\}_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\hat u(x;s) := u(wR + x(s-R))&lt;/math&gt;, obeys single crossing (though
not necessarily increasing) differences. By Theorem 6, &lt;math&gt;\{V(\cdot;t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; obeys single crossing differences, and hence &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\geq 0}V(x;t)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\cdot;t)\}_{t\in T}&lt;/math&gt; is ordered with
respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.

== Aggregation of the single crossing property ==

While the sum of increasing functions is also increasing, it is clear that the single crossing property need not be preserved by aggregation.  For the sum of single crossing functions to have the same property requires that the functions be related to each other in a particular manner.

'''Definition (monotone signed-ratio):'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2012): “Aggregating the Single Crossing Property,” ''Econometrica'', 80(5), 2333–2348.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;(S,\geq_S)&lt;/math&gt; be a poset. Two functions &lt;math&gt;f,g: S \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; obey ''signed{ -}ratio monotonicity'' if, for any &lt;math&gt;s' \geq s&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds:
* if &lt;math&gt;f(s) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then

:: &lt;math&gt;-\frac {g(s)}{f(s)} \geq -\frac{g(s')}{f(s')};&lt;/math&gt;

* if &lt;math&gt;f(s) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then

:: &lt;math&gt;-\frac {f(s)}{g(s)} \geq -\frac{f(s')}{g(s')}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proposition 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be two single crossing functions. Then &lt;math&gt;\alpha f + \beta g&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function for any non{-}negative scalars &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; obey signed-ratio monotonicity.

:''Proof:'' Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(s) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\alpha^* = - g(s)/f(s)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\alpha^* f(s) + g(s) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha^* f(s) + g(s)&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function, it must be that &lt;math&gt;\alpha^* f(s') + g(s') \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt;s' \geq s&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, recall that since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function, then &lt;math&gt;f(s') &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. By rearranging the above inequality, we conclude that

:: &lt;math&gt;\alpha^* = -\frac{g(s)}{f(s)} \geq -\frac{g(s')}{f(s')}.&lt;/math&gt;

:To prove the converse, without loss of generality assume that &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that
:: &lt;math&gt;
\alpha f(s) + g(s) \geq (&gt;) 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
:If both &lt;math&gt;f(s) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(s')\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s')\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; since both functions are single crossing. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\alpha f(s') + g(s') \geq (&gt;) 0&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;g(s)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(s)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; obey signed{-}ratio monotonicity it must be that

:: &lt;math&gt;\alpha \geq (&gt;) -\frac{g(s)}{f(s)} \geq -\frac{g(s')}{f(s')}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function, &lt;math&gt;f(s')&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\alpha f(s') + g(s') \geq (&gt;) \ 0.&lt;/math&gt; ''Q.E.D.''

This result can be generalized to infinite sums in the following sense.

'''Theorem 7:'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2012): “Aggregating the Single Crossing Property,” ''Econometrica'', 80(5), 2333–2348.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;(T, \mathcal{T}, \mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite measure space and suppose that, for each &lt;math&gt;s \in  S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(s; t)&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded and measurable function of &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(s) = \int_T f(s; t) d\mu(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function if, for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t' \in T&lt;/math&gt;, the pair of functions &lt;math&gt;f(s; t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(s; t')&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt; satisfy signed-ratio monotonicity. This condition is also necessary if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; contains all singleton sets and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is required to be a single crossing function for any finite measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Application (Monopoly problem under uncertainty):'''&lt;ref&gt;Quah, J. K.-H., and B. Strulovici (2012): “Aggregating the Single Crossing Property,” ''Econometrica'', 80(5), 2333–2348.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm faces uncertainty over the demand for its output &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the profit at state &lt;math&gt;t \in T \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is given
by &lt;math&gt;\Pi(x; -c, t) = xP(x; t) - cx&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the marginal cost and &lt;math&gt;P(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse demand function in state &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The firm maximizes

: &lt;math&gt;V(x; -c) = \int_T u(\Pi(x; -c, t))d\lambda(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of state &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the Bernoulli utility function representing the firm’s attitude towards uncertainty.  By Theorem 1, &lt;math&gt;\arg\max_{x\geq 0} V(x;-c)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing in &lt;math&gt;-c&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., output falls with marginal cost) if the family &lt;math&gt;\{V(x; -c)\}_{c \in \mathbb{R}_+}&lt;/math&gt; obeys single crossing differences.  By definition, the latter says that, for any &lt;math&gt;x' \geq x&lt;/math&gt;, the function

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(-c)=\int_T [u(\Pi(x'; -c, t)) - u(\Pi(x; -c, t))] \, d\lambda(t),&lt;/math&gt;

is a single crossing function. For each &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta(-c, t) = u(\Pi(x'; -c, t)) - u(\Pi(x; -c, t))&lt;/math&gt; is s single crossing function of &lt;math&gt;-c&lt;/math&gt;. However, unless &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is linear, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; will not, in general, be increasing in &lt;math&gt;-c&lt;/math&gt;. Applying Theorem 6, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a single crossing function if, for any &lt;math&gt;t', t \in T&lt;/math&gt;, the functions &lt;math&gt;\delta(-c, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta(-c, t')&lt;/math&gt; (of &lt;math&gt;-c&lt;/math&gt;) obey signed-ratio monotonicity.  This is guaranteed when (i) &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and increasing in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\log(P(\cdot,t))\}_{t \in T}&lt;/math&gt; obeys increasing differences; and (ii) &lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is twice differentiable, with &lt;math&gt;u' &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and obeys decreasing absolute [[risk aversion]] (DARA).

'''''Norris v. Ireland''''' was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) in 1988, in which [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] successfully charged that [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s criminalisation of certain homosexual acts between consenting adult men was in breach of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (right to respect for private and family life).

== Original case ==
{{main article|Norris v. Attorney General}}
The original case in the [[Courts of the Republic of Ireland|Irish courts]] was [[Norris v. Attorney General]], introduced in 1977 and decided by the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court of Ireland]] in 1983. Norris's [[Senior Counsel]] was fellow member of the [[Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform]], [[Mary Robinson]], who in 1990 would become the first female [[President of Ireland]]. The Irish courts ruled that Norris's [[right to privacy]] was not violated by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (criminalising "[[buggery]]") and the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] (criminalising "[[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]]").

== Case before the ECtHR ==
Norris appealed the Irish court's decision to the ECtHR in 1983. The Court passed judgment in 1988, deciding in Norris's favour on grounds similar to those of its 1981 decision in ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]''.

The laws impugned by the judgment were eventually repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1993/06/23/00021.asp|title=Private Members' Business. - Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.|date=23 June 1993|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=9 July 2012|quote=it is the case that the main sections of the Bill arise against a background of the European Court decision in the Norris case}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/ Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993] [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Odalisque (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|280px|''Cariye'' or Imperial Concubine]]
The '''Imperial Harem''' ({{lang-ota|حرم همايون}}, ''Harem-i Hümâyûn'') of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the [[Ottoman sultan]]'s [[harem]] composed of the wives, servants (both female slaves and [[eunuchs]]), female relatives, and the [[Ottoman Sultans' concubines|sultan's concubines]], occupying a [[seraglio|secluded portion]] of the Ottoman imperial household.&lt;ref name="Merriam Webster"&gt;{{cite web |title=Harem |website=Merriam-webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc. |date=n.d. |access-date=23 October 2013 |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This institution played an important social function within the [[Ottoman court]], and demonstrated considerable political authority in Ottoman affairs, especially during the long period known as the [[Sultanate of Women]].&lt;ref name="Iyigun"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iyigun|first1=Murat|title=Lessons from the Ottoman Harem on Culture, Religion, and Wars|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=July 2013|volume=61|issue=4|pages=693–730|doi=10.1086/670376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utmost authority in the Imperial Harem was the [[Valide Sultan]], who ruled over the other women in the household and was often of [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave origin]] herself. The [[Kizlar Agha]] (Kızlarağası, also known as the "Chief Black Eunuch" because of the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] origin of most aghas) was the head of the eunuchs responsible for guarding the Imperial Harem.

== Etymology ==
The word ''harem'' is derived from the Arabic ''harim'' or ''haram'' which give connotations of the sacred and forbidden. The female quarters of Turkish households were then referred to as ''haremlik'' due to their prevailing exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Delplato" /&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

==The Harem as a social and political institution==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
The harem was the ultimate symbol of the Sultan's power. His ownership of women, mostly slaves, was a sign of wealth, power, and sexual prowess. The institution was introduced in the Turkish society with adoption of Islam, under the influence of the Arab Caliphate, which the Ottomans emulated. To ensure the obedience of the women, many of them were bought and kept into slavery. However, not all members of the Harem were slaves. The main wives, especially those taken into marriage to consolidate personal and dynastic alliances were free women. This was the exception, not the rule. The relationship between slavery and polygamy/harems in the Turkish Harem continued until 1908, at the very least.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The imperial harem also served as a parallel institution to the sultan's household of male servants. The women were provided with an education roughly on par with that provided to male pages, and at the end of their respective educations they would be married off to one another, as the latter graduated from the palace to occupy administrative posts in the empire's provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru |title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=90, 111–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, only a small fraction of the women in the harem actually engaged in sexual relations with the sultan, as most were destined to marry members of the Ottoman political elite, or else to continue service to the [[Valide Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru |title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harem quarters==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The Imperial Harem occupied one of the large sections of the private apartments of the sultan at the [[Topkapı Palace#Harem|Topkapi Palace]] which encompassed more than 400 rooms. After 1853, an equally lavish harem quarter was occupied at the new imperial palace at [[Dolmabahçe Palace|Dolmabahçe]].

===Role of the Valide Sultan===
{{Main article|Valide sultan}}The mother of a new sultan came to the harem with pomp, circumstance and assumed the title of [[Valide Sultan|valide sultan]] or sultana mother upon her son's ascension. She was paramount chief and ran the Harem and ruled over the members of the dynasty.  The [[Valide Sultan]] who influenced the political life of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during various periods of history (such as the [[Sultanate of Women]] in the 16th and 17th centuries) had the authority to regulate the relations between the sultan and his wives and children. At times the [[Valide Sultan|valide sultan]] acted as regent for her son, particularly in the seventeenth century, when a series of accidents necessitated regencies that endowed the position of Queen Mother with great political power.&lt;ref name="Imperial Harem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peirce|first1=Leslie P.|title=The imperial harem: women and sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, [[Empress Eugénie]] of France visited the Imperial harem, which was to have a lasting effect. She was taken by the sultan [[Abdülaziz]] to his mother, Valide Sultan [[Pertevniyal Sultan]], but reportedly, Pertevniyal became outraged by the presence of a foreign woman in her [[harem]], and greeted the Empress with a slap in the face, almost provoking an international incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freely|first1=John|authorlink1=John Freely|title=Inside the Seraglio: private lives of the sultans in Istanbul|date=2016|publisher=I.B.

===Role of the court ladies===
[[File:Favourites courtyard Topkapi March 2008.JPG|thumb|The Courtyard of the Favourites in the harem of Topkapı Palace]]
For the perpetuation and service of the [[Ottoman Dynasty]], beautiful and intelligent slave girls were either captured in war, recruited within the empire, or procured from neighbouring countries to become imperial [[court ladies]] (''Cariyes''). [[Odalisque]], a word derived from the Turkish ''oda'', meaning chamber: thus connoting odalisque to mean chamber girl or attendant, was not a term synonymous with concubine; however, in western usage the term has come to refer specifically to the harem concubine.&lt;ref name="Delplato"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DelPlato|first1=Joan|title=Multiple wives, multiple pleasures: representing the harem, 1800-1875|date=2002|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=9780838638804}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

The court ladies who were introduced into the harem in their tender age were brought up in the discipline of the palace. They were promoted according to their capacities and became ''kalfas'' and ''ustas''.

The court ladies with whom the sultan shared his bed became a member of the dynasty and rose in rank to attain the status of ''Gözde'' (the Favorite), ''Ikbal'' (the Fortunate) or ''Kadın'' (the Woman/Wife). The highest position was the Valide Sultan, the legal mother of the sultan, who herself used to be a wife or a concubine of the sultan's father and rose to the supreme rank in the harem. No court lady could leave or enter the premises of the harem without the explicit permission of the valide sultan. The power of the valide sultan over concubines even extended to questions of life and death, with [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] directly reporting to her.

The court ladies either lived in the halls beneath the apartments of the [[queen consort|consorts]], the valide sultan and the sultan, or in separate chambers. The ''kadın''s, who numbered up to four, formed the group who came next in rank to the valide sultan. Right below the ''kadın''s in rank were the ''ikbal''s, whose number was unspecified. Last in the hierarchy were the ''gözde''s.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Harem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 16th and 17th century, chief consort of the sultan received title ''[[haseki sultan]]'' or sultana consort. This title surpassed other titles and ranks by which the prominent consorts of the sultans had been known (hatun and kadin). When the position of valide sultan was vacant, a haseki could take valide's role, have access to considerable economic resources, become chief of imperial harem, sultan's advisor in politic matters, and even have an influence upon foreign policy and on international politics. This cases happened during [[Hürrem Sultan]] and [[Kösem Sultan]]'s periods.

===Role of the eunuchs===

[[File:Eunuch courtyard Harem Topkapi Istanbul 2007 85.JPG|thumb|The Courtyard of the Eunuchs in Topkapı Palace]]
At [[Topkapı Palace]], at the court of the Ottoman sultans, the harem staff included [[eunuch]]s. These were [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] slaves captured in the Nile vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=Ethiopia: the era of the princes: the challenge of Islam and re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855|year=1968|publisher=Praeger|pages=57–60|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=qo1yAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castrated servicemen in the [[Muslim]] and Turkish states in the [[Middle Ages]] were recruited to serve in the palace from the times of Sultan [[Mehmed I]] onwards. These eunuchs who were trained in the palace and were given the charge of guarding the harem rose in rank after serving in many positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Godfrey|title=Topkapi Palace: an illustrated guide to its life &amp; personalities|date=1999|publisher=Saqi Books|location=London|isbn=0863560679|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harem eunuchs and the harem organization were under the command of the Chief harem eunuch, who was also called the Master of the Girls (''Kızlar Ağası'') or [[Chief Black Eunuch]]. They supervised the quarters where the female population of the palace lived. They had influence on the palace and later on the state administration in the 17th and 18th centuries as they had access to the sultan and the sultan's family and became very powerful.

The Chief Black Eunuch was sometimes considered second only to the [[Grand Vizier]] (head of the imperial government, but often working in his own palace or even away, e.g., on military campaign) in the confidence of the Sultan, to whom he had and arranged access (including his bedchamber, the ''[[List of Latin phrases: N|ne plus ultra]]'' for every harem lady), also being his confidential messenger. As commander of an imperial army corps, the [[halberd]]iers ('baltacı'), he even held the supreme military dignity of three-[[tugh|horsetail]] [[pasha]] (general).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Meanwhile, the [[Chief White Eunuch]] (''Kapı Ağası''), was in charge of 300 to 900 white eunuchs as head of the 'Inner Service' (the palace bureaucracy, controlling all messages, petitions, and State documents addressed to the Sultan), head of the [[Palace School]], gatekeeper-in-chief, head of the infirmary, and master of ceremonies of the Seraglio, and was originally the only one allowed to speak to the Sultan in private. In 1591, [[Murad III]] transferred the powers of the white to the black eunuchs as there was too much [[embezzlement]] and various other nefarious crimes attributed to the white eunuchs, but later they regained some favour.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

During the [[Sultanate of Women]] (''Kadınlar Sultanati''), eunuchs increased their political leverage by taking advantage of minor or mentally incompetent sultans. Teenage Sultans were "guided" by regencies formed by the Queen Mother (''Valide Sultan''), the Grand Vizier and the Valide's other supporters- and the Chief Black Eunuch was the Queen Mother's and Chief Consorts' intimate and valued accomplice.

[[File:Veliahd Dairesi Topkapi Istanbul 2007 panorama.jpg|thumb|The apartments of the princes, also called ''kafes'' (cage), were part of the imperial Ottoman harem]]
The Ottoman harem was often called "the [[golden cage]]". After Ahmed I's reformation of the law of succession to Ottoman throne and decline of ''sancağa çıkma'' (system of appointing young princes as provincial governors to train them in how to rule), princes were confined the ''[[kafes]]'', (cage, also the Şimşirlik, Boxwood Quarters) in Topkapı Palace. They lived here in seclusion until they either acceded to the throne or were executed in order to prevent a war of succession.

It collects the evidence obtained by a diocesan inquiry into a candidate's [[heroic virtue]]s in a form suitable for presentation to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].  Upon presentation, the ''positio'' is examined by a committee of expert historians and theologians, and if they find the evidence presented suitable, they may then make a recommendation to the Pope that the candidate be declared Venerable.

''Positios'' can run to over 1,000 pages in length.  The time between the preparation of a ''positio'' and a recommendation by the committee of historians and theologians can often be measured in decades.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

In [[computer network]]s, a '''reverse DNS lookup''' or '''reverse DNS resolution''' ('''rDNS''') is the querying of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) to determine the [[domain name]] associated with an [[IP address]] – the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses [[PTR record]]s. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the [[.arpa|arpa]] [[top-level domain]].

Although the informational RFC 1912&lt;ref name="RFC 1912"/&gt; (Section 2.1) recommends that "every Internet-reachable host should have a name" and that "for every IP address, there should be a matching PTR record," it is not an [[Internet Standard]] requirement, and not all IP addresses have a reverse entry.

== Historical usage ==
The modern "reverse DNS lookup" should not be confused with the now-obsolete&lt;ref name="RFC 3425"/&gt; "inverse query" (IQUERY) mechanism specified in RFC 1035:
{{quote|Inverse queries take the form of a single [[Resource record|RR]] in the answer section of the message, with an empty question section.  The owner name of the query RR and its [[Time to live|TTL]] are not significant.  The response carries questions in the question section which identify all names possessing the query RR ''which the name server knows''. Since no name server knows about all of the domain name space, the response can never be assumed to be complete.  Thus inverse queries are primarily useful for database management and debugging activities.  Inverse queries are ''not'' an acceptable method of mapping host addresses to host names; use the &lt;code&gt;in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt; domain instead.&lt;ref name="RFC 1035"/&gt;}}

The IQUERY message type was always "optional"&lt;ref name="RFC 1035"/&gt; and "never achieved widespread use";&lt;ref name="RFC 3425"/&gt; it was "permanently retired"&lt;ref name="RFC 3425"/&gt; in 2002 with the adoption of RFC 3425.

== Implementation details ==
===IPv4 reverse resolution===
Reverse DNS lookups for [[IPv4]] addresses use the special domain &lt;code&gt;in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt;. In this domain, an IPv4 address is represented as a concatenated sequence of four decimal numbers, separated by dots, to which is appended the second level domain suffix &lt;code&gt;.in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt;. The four decimal numbers are obtained by splitting the 32-bit IPv4 address into four [[octet (computing)|octet]]s and converting each octet into a decimal number. These decimal numbers are then concatenated in the order: least significant octet first (leftmost), to most significant octet last (rightmost). It is important to note that this is the reverse order to the usual dotted-decimal convention for writing IPv4 addresses in textual form.

For example, to do a reverse lookup of the IP address {{IPaddr|8.8.4.4}} the PTR record for the domain name &lt;code&gt;4.4.8.8.in-addr.arpa&lt;/code&gt; would be looked up, and found to point to &lt;code&gt;google-public-dns-b.google.com&lt;/code&gt;. 

If the [[A record]] for &lt;code&gt;google-public-dns-b.google.com&lt;/code&gt; in turn pointed back to {{IPaddr|8.8.4.4}} then it would be said to be [[Forward-confirmed reverse DNS|forward-confirmed]].

====Classless reverse DNS method====
Historically, Internet registries and Internet service providers allocated IP addresses in blocks of 256 (for Class C) or larger octet-based blocks for classes B and A. By definition, each block fell upon an octet boundary. The structure of the reverse DNS domain was based on this definition. However, with the introduction of [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]], IP addresses were allocated in much smaller blocks, and hence the original design of pointer records was impractical, since autonomy of administration of smaller blocks could not be granted. RFC 2317 devised a methodology to address this problem by using [[CNAME record]]s.

===IPv6 reverse resolution===
Reverse DNS lookups for [[IPv6]] addresses use the special domain &lt;code&gt;ip6.arpa&lt;/code&gt; (previously &lt;code&gt;ip6.int&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc4159&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=4159|bcp=109|title=Deprecation of "ip6.int"|author=G. Huston|date=August 2005|publisher=Network Working Group [[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An IPv6 address appears as a name in this domain as a sequence of [[nibble]]s in reverse order, represented as hexadecimal digits as subdomains. For example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address {{IPaddr|2001:db8::567:89ab}} is &lt;code&gt;b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa&lt;/code&gt;.

===Multiple pointer records===
While most rDNS entries only have one PTR record, DNS does not restrict the number. Multiple PTR records are used, for example, when a web server supports many [[virtual host]]s{{mdash}} i.e. multiple hostnames then resolve to a single address, and multiple hostnames will be returned for a PTR lookup for that shared address. However, DNS lookups typically occur over UDP, and since UDP has a limited message size, in extreme cases, multiple PTRs could cause a DNS response to exceed those UDP limits.

===Records other than PTR records===
Record types other than PTR records may also appear in the reverse DNS tree. For example, encryption keys may be placed there for [[IPsec]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]] and [[Internet Key Exchange|IKE]]. [[Zero-configuration networking#DNS-SD|DNS-Based Service Discovery]] uses specially-named records in the reverse DNS tree to provide hints to clients about subnet-specific service discovery domains.&lt;ref name=rfc6763&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=6763|title=DNS-Based Service Discovery|author1=S. Cheshire|author2=M. Krochmal|date=February 2013|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721|section=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less standardized usages include comments placed in [[TXT record]]s and [[LOC record]]s to identify the geophysical location of an IP address.

==Uses==
The most common uses of the reverse DNS include:

* The original use of the rDNS: network troubleshooting via tools such as [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]], and the "Received:" trace header field for [[SMTP]] e-mail, web sites tracking users (especially on [[Internet forum]]s), etc.
* One [[anti-spam techniques (e-mail)#PTR.2Freverse DNS checks|e-mail anti-spam technique]]: checking the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dialup users, or dynamically assigned addresses unlikely to be used by legitimate mail servers. Owners of such IP addresses typically assign them generic rDNS names such as "1-2-3-4-dynamic-ip.example.com." Some anti-spam filters assume that email that originates from such addresses is likely to be spam, and may refuse connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamhaus.org/faq/answers.lasso?section=ISP%20Spam%20Issues#131 spamhaus's FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postmaster.aol.com/info/rdns.html reference page from AOL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210223820/http://postmaster.aol.com/info/rdns.html |date=December 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] (FCrDNS) verification can create a form of authentication showing a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the server that has been given an IP address. While not very thorough, this validation is strong enough to often be used for [[whitelist]]ing purposes, since [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]] and [[Phishing|phishers]] usually cannot achieve forward validation when they use [[zombie computer]]s to forge domain records.
* System logging or monitoring tools often receive entries with the relevant devices specified only by IP addresses. To provide more human-usable data, these programs often perform a reverse lookup before writing the log, thus writing a name rather than the IP address.

== Background ==
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2011}}
Born in [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], Hack attended the Lynnewood School, and [[Haverford High School]], on the [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]] in suburban [[Philadelphia]].  He later attended [[Pennsylvania State University]] and holds a Master’s Degree in Environmental Design.

Hack moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he was hired by ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine as its West Coast national programming editor.  By the early 1980s, Hack began writing the TeleVisions column for the daily entertainment trade paper, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]].''  During the next decade, Hack was instrumental in propelling the paper into a dominant position over rival ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]],'' and often appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' reporting on [[Hollywood]].

During the same period, he was a frequent guest on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah Winfrey]],'' ''[[Good Morning America]],'' ''[[Larry King Live]],'' ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]],'' ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]],'' ''[[Entertainment Tonight]],'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]].''

In 1990, Hack left ''The Hollywood Reporter'' to become Vice President of Creative Affairs at Dove Audio and Entertainment, a production company that specialized in [[miniseries]] and [[Audiobook|books-on-tape]].  While at Dove, Hack adapted [[Sidney Sheldon]]’s ''[[The Sands of Time (Sheldon novel)|The Sands of Time]]'', ''[[Memories of Midnight]]'', and ''[[The Stars Shine Down]]'' as mini-series, which he also produced, and wrote his first book, ''Next to Hughes'' with [[Robert Maheu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352378/ |title=Richard Hack |accessdate=26 March 2010 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Internet Movie Database |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving Dove, Hack moved to a horse ranch in [[Maui]], where he stabled polo ponies, and established a home on the Intracoastal in [[Florida]].

His bestseller ''Hughes: The Private Diaries, Memos and Letters'' was released on September 11, 2001.  Hack was being interviewed live on the ''Today'' show by [[Matt Lauer]] when [[American Airlines Flight 11|the first plane]] [[September 11 attacks|crashed into the]] [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], and Lauer consequently had to cut their interview short to report on the ongoing events. The abrupt ending of their interview and the early reports of the attack from the ''Today'' show, is shown in a continuous loop, as part of an exhibit in the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in New York City.

His subsequent book, ''PuppetMaster: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover'' was the basis of the 2011 film ''[[J. Edgar]]'', directed by Clint Eastwood.

==''The Aviator'' misattribution==
It is sometimes stated that Hack's book ''Hughes'' served as the basis for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2004 film about Howard Hughes, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''.

However, two competing films about Hughes were in development at the same time. The other film was to have been directed by [[Christopher Nolan]], with star [[Jim Carrey]] and financing from [[Castle Rock Entertainment|Castle Rock]]. Its script was going to be based on Hack's biography. That film was never produced. However, "Aviator" star Leonardo DiCaprio has referred to Hack's biography in interviews about the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/S/Scorsese_Martin/2002/01/25/761570.html Scorsese grabs lead in duelling Hughes films], 25 January 2002.

'''Joseph Michael Laurinaitis''' (born September 12, 1960) is an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''Road Warrior Animal''' (or simply '''Animal'''). Along with [[Road Warrior Hawk]], he was one-half of the [[tag team]] [[The Road Warriors|The Road Warriors/The Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref name=alumni/&gt; Also a sporadic singles competitor, he headlined the 2001 WCW [[pay-per-view]] event [[WCW Sin|Sin]], in contention for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]].

He is also known for his work in the [[WWE|WWF/E]], where he is a three-time tag team champion. He was inducted with Hawk into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

==Early life==
Laurinaitis grew up in Minnesota, having to work for a living from a very early age. He attended [[Irondale High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screamandfly.com/archive/index.php/t-45431.html|title=Death of a REAL Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his size and love of power lifting, Laurinaitis was an imposing figure and thus a very effective bouncer.&lt;ref name=alumni&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/roadwarriors|title=Road Warriors' Alumni Profile|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a bouncer at Grandma B's in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] where he caught the eye of [[Eddie Sharkey]], a well-known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Laurinaitis and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Mike Hegstrand]], [[Rick Rude|Richard Rood]], and [[Barry Darsow]] could make it big in professional wrestling, and trained all four of them.&lt;ref name="Tag"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Greg|last1=Oliver|first2=Steve|last2=Johnson|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams|publisher=ECW Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1982–1983)===
Laurinaitis made his debut in November 1982, competing as '''The Road Warrior''' using a biker [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]. After only a few matches as a singles competitor, Joe's career and life would change thanks to an idea by [[Paul Ellering]].

===American and Japanese territories (1983–1986)===
{{Main|The Road Warriors}}
When [[Paul Ellering]] was looking to put together a stable of heels in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) called "The Legion of Doom", it was decided to put Laurinaitis together with his good friend Mike Hegstrand and change their names to "Animal" and "Hawk" respectively. Thus, the Road Warriors were born. They first started out as biker gimmicks; on The Road Warriors DVD, Animal said he felt like one of the [[Village People]]. To look more intimidating, the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, spiked shoulder pads, and face paint. The look and name were taken from ''[[Mad Max 2|The Road Warrior]]'', helping to paint the two as no-mercy monsters. Their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#I|interview]] style was vicious, yet charismatic and a bit humorous.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

The team was an instant hit, revolutionizing the tag-team scene with their power moves, no mercy attitudes, and innovative face paint that would spawn many future imitators in wrestling.&lt;ref name="LODDVD"&gt;{{cite video|people=Various Comments:|title=Road Warriors: The Life and Death of Wrestling's Most Dominant Tag-Team|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476485/|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video|location=USA|date=June 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, they won the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] four times before moving on to bigger promotions, such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] in the US and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], winning more tag team titles.&lt;ref name="Titles"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Royal|last1=Duncan|first2=Gary|last2=Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jim Crockett Promotions (1986–1990)===
Their hard hitting style, no nonsense attitude, and winning ways made the Road Warriors fan favorites. Even when they were booked as heels, the fans refused to boo them.&lt;ref name="LODDVD"/&gt; They started to split their time between the AWA and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) until finally leaving the AWA for big money contracts with the NWA and a huge push for the monster duo.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; The move paid off instantly as they won the inaugural [[Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament]] and feuded with the top stars of the NWA such as [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] and [[The Russian Team]] (which included the Road Warriors' old training buddy Barry Darsow).&lt;ref name=alumni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/cup.html#1st|title=NWA Crockett Cup Results (1986)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87|title=NeWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #1)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87b|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #2)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87c|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #3)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#87|title=NWA Starrcade Results (1987)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#86|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1986)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwaawa.html#1285|title=NWA/AWA Star Wars Results (December 1985)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwaawa.html#0286|title=NWA/AWA Star Wars Results (1986)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their initial run in the NWA, they helped popularize the [[WarGames match]], the [[Professional wrestling match types#Scaffold match|Scaffold match]], and their trademark [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Chicago Street Fight]].&lt;ref name="WG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#86|title=NWA Starrcade Results (1986)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#90|title=NWA Wrestle War Results (1990)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the Road Warriors engaged in a violent feud with [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]) the first team that could truly match the Road Warriors in power (and who were one of the most well known Road Warrior clones). The Powers of Pain even went so far as to injure Animal's eye ([[kayfabe]]) during a weightlifting competition. When Animal returned, he initially wore a hockey goalie mask to protect his eye. The angle abruptly ended when the Powers of Pain left the NWA after finding out they were booked against the Road Warriors in a series of Scaffold Matches and they did not want to get hurt by falling off the scaffold.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

Near the end of 1988, the Road Warriors captured the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] whom they mauled in short order to win the titles.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; After being the "Uncrowned champions" for a long time the Road Warriors' run with the tag team titles was short lived. [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] used a fast count to cheat the Road Warriors out of their titles.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In their last year with the NWA, the Warriors feuded mainly with [[The Varsity Club]], [[the Headshrinkers|The Samoan Swat Team]], and [[The Skyscrapers]] before leaving the NWA in the summer of 1990, due to conflicts with [[Jim Herd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/miscppv.html#chi|title=NWA Chi-Town Rumble Results|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#VI |title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (VI) |accessdate=April 17, 2007 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html |archivedate=June 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#89|title=NWA Wrestle War Results (1989)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#VIII |title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (VIII) |accessdate=April 17, 2007 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html |archivedate=June 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#89|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1989)|accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#89|title=NWA Halloween Havoc Results (1989)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#X |title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (X) |accessdate=April 17, 2007 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html |archivedate=June 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1990–1992)===
The Road Warriors immediately signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1990 and were pushed into a feud with the most famous of all "Road Warrior Clones", [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], a group which included their old training partner Barry Darsow.&lt;ref name=alumni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1990|accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|quote=(June 25, 1990) The Legion of Doom defeated Black Bart &amp; Tom Stone at 1:12 when Road Warrior Hawk pinned Stone following the Doomsday Device (LOD's debut)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ailing health of one of Demolition ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]]) he was replaced by [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] but the magic of the original Demolition was gone and the feud did not live up to the high hopes of the fans.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

Just over a year after signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] and held it for about eight months.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; When they lost the titles, they briefly left the WWF, only to return with longtime manager Paul Ellering by their side, as well as a wooden ventriloquist dummy called "Rocco". Both members of the L.O.D. thought the Rocco gimmick was stupid, and it led to Hegstrand walking out of the WWF immediately following [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam 1992]], leaving Laurinaitis on his own for the first time in nine years.&lt;ref name="WrestleCrap"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=R. D. Reynolds|first1=R.D.|last1=Reynolds|first2=Randy|last2=Baer|title=Wrestlecrap – the very worst of pro wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal went ahead and finished his contractual obligations with the WWF, as a singles wrestler and occasionally teaming with former rival Crush, formerly of Demolition. During a handicap match in Japan against the [[Beverly Brothers]] in September 1992, Laurinaitis legitimately injured his back from a botched double suplex and had to take a lengthy hiatus.&lt;ref name="LODDVD"/&gt; His last match was a victory over Papa Shango in San Francisco, California on October 16. After this his back was too injured to allow him to wrestle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1993, 1996)===
Laurinaitis made some non-wrestling appearances in WCW in 1993. On August 18, at the [[Clash of the Champions]], Animal made his appearance, getting out of a black [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro Z28]] indicating his partner Hawk was [[Dustin Rhodes]]' mystery partner against [[Rick Rude]] and [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|The Equalizer]]. On September 19, at [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]], Animal was the advisor for [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s team, consisting of Sting, [[Davey Boy Smith]], Dustin Rhodes, and [[Fred Ottman#The Shockmaster incident (1993)|The Shockmaster]] for WarGames, defeating [[Big Van Vader]], [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sid Vicious]], and [[Harlem Heat]]. On January 4, 1995, Animal seconded Hawk in his match against [[Scott Norton]] in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s annual [[Tokyo Dome]] show.

For the next couple of years, Laurinaitis stayed out of the wrestling ring, collecting on an insurance policy from [[Lloyd's of London]] while Hegstrand competed all over the world. Near the end of 1995, Laurinaitis' back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition. Three years after everyone thought the Road Warriors had ended, they reunited and signed a contract with [[World Championship Wrestling]].&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; Upon their return in January 1996, they immediately started a feud with [[the Steiner Brothers]], who returned in March, and [[Harlem Heat]], before moving on to challenge the WCW Tag Team Champions [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Lex Luger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VI|title=WCW SuperBrawl Results (VI)| accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#96|title=WCW Uncensored Results (1996)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/slambore.html#96|title=WCW Slamboree Results (1996)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Road Warriors had several shots at the champions but never won the title in the six months they were with the company. [[The Steiner Brothers]] also arrived shortly after the Warriors did, and feuded with them to try to prove who the best team of all time was. The Steiners got the better of the feud and the Warriors left WCW in June 1996.

===Return to WWF (1997–1999)===
After leaving WCW they returned to the WWF where the Legion of Doom took part in the [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] vs. [[the Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|the Hart Foundation]] feud, siding with Austin against the Harts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm| title=WWF Show Results 1997|accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|quote=(February 24, 1997) The Legion of Doom fought the Headbangers to a double count-out; after the bout, Road Warrior Hawk hit the flying clothesline on one of the Headbangers (LOD's surprise return match after more than a four-year absence)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#16|title=WWF In Your House Results (Canadian Stampede)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion of Doom also became two-time tag team champions on October 7, 1997, when they defeated [[The Godwinns]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In November 1997, the Legion of Doom faced the newly formed [[New Age Outlaws]] ([[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]] and [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]]) and lost the titles to the upstart team.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

After several unsuccessful challenges the L.O.D. were repackaged as '''Legion of Doom 2000''' with manager [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]], although she did not stay with the team for long.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with [[Harris Brothers|D.O.A.]], whom L.O.D. were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the Road Warriors DVD that it was hard for Ellering to work with another team against the Road Warriors and difficult to rip on his former team on promos.

In 1998, the Legion of Doom became involved in their most controversial angle; playing off Hegstrand's real life drug and alcohol problems. Hawk started to show up drunk or "unable to perform" on TV. As Hawk proved more and more erratic and unreliable, a third L.O.D. member, [[Darren Drozdov|Puke]], was introduced to team with Animal while Hawk dealt with his personal issues. The storyline ended with accusations that Puke had been the "enabler" of Hawk's problems, exploiting them to take Hawk's place in the team. During the controversial segment, Hawk was shown to have fallen off the Titan Tron. Neither Hegstrand nor Laurinaitis approved of the WWF exploiting Hegstrand's personal problems, which caused them to subsequently leave the WWF.&lt;ref name="WrestleCrap"/&gt;

While the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref name="LODDVD2"&gt;{{cite video|people=Joseph "Animal" Laurinaitis|title=Road Warriors: The Life and Death of Wrestling's Most Dominant Tag-Team|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video|location=USA|date=June 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to WCW (2001)===
In 2001 Animal landed a prominent position in WCW as the "enforcer" of the stable known as [[Magnificent Seven (professional wrestling)|The Magnificent Seven]] with the objective to protect WCW World Champion [[Scott Steiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/miscppv.html#sin|title=WCW Sin Results|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magnificent Seven split up shortly before Vince McMahon purchased WCW; Animal's contract was not one of the contracts the WWF picked up.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2003, 2007, 2016)===
The Road Warriors appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in late 2002-early 2003 as part of a group that opposed [[Vince Russo]]'s faction [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]], but would only wrestle one actual match for the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/info/quickresults/weeklyppv/2003.html |title=TNA Weekly PPV Results 2003 |accessdate=April 17, 2007 |publisher=[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] |quote=(January 15, 2003) Vince Russo &amp; Triple X (Christopher Daniels, Low Ki, and Elix Skipper) defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Jeff Jarrett, Dusty Rhodes, z,d The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127124150/http://www.tnawrestling.com/info/quickresults/weeklyppv/2003.html |archivedate=January 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2007, Road Warrior Animal returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the pay-per-view, [[Slammiversary (2007)|Slammiversary]], with [[Rick Steiner]]; he replaced [[Scott Steiner]], who was out with an injury. They ended up losing to [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]].

On December 15, 2016, Animal returned to TNA for a guest appearance on the ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]'' special, "[[Total Nonstop Deletion]]".

===Second return to WWE (2003–present)===
Animal and Hawk made a surprise appearance on RAW on May 12, 2003 when they took on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] for the World Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name=alumni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/03.htm|title=WWE Show Results 2003| accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|quote=(May 12, 2003) WWE Raw Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam &amp; Kane defeated the Legion of Doom when RVD pinned Road Warrior Hawk following the chokeslam / Five Star Frog Splash combo (LOD's surprise return after more than a 4-year absence)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawk would die five months later, on October 19, 2003.&lt;ref name="LODDVD"/&gt;

Animal made a return to WWE on the July 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'' in 2005, where he was challenged by the then-[[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] to a title match at ''[[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/05.htm|title=Smackdown Results (July 14, 2005)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=WWE|quote=After being attacked by WWE Tag Team Champions MNM, Road Warrior Animal stormed the ring to a tremendous ovation to make the save.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/gabash.html#2005|title=WWE Great American Bash Results (2005)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a new tag team partner in [[Jon Heidenreich|Heidenreich]], Animal went on to defeat MNM for the titles, dedicating the win to Hawk by saying, "Hawk, this one was for you, brother!"&lt;ref name=alumni/&gt;&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; The two would team up for a few months in a new chapter of the Legion of Doom, with Heidenreich adopting the L.O.D.'s shoulder pads, face paint, and mohawk haircut. However, this came to an end with Heidenreich's release from WWE on January 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/16973|title=WWE News: WWE updates status of drug testing program, Heidenreich released|accessdate=April 17, 2007|authorlink=Wade Keller|first=Wade|last=Keller|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=WWE.com reports that Heidenreich has been released from his WWE contract|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101185901/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/16973 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the March 3, 2006, episode of ''SmackDown!'', Animal teamed up with [[Matt Hardy]] to face MNM. After he and Hardy lost the match, Animal turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the second time in his career by attacking and injuring Hardy's knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/06.htm|title=WWE Show Results 2006|accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|quote=(February 27, 2006) WWE Smackdown!

After the heel turn, Animal, once again known simply as '''The Road Warrior''', would drop many aspects of the well-known Road Warrior gimmick, losing the face paint, and shoulder pads. Animal's look at this time was similar to his old Road Warrior gimmick in the early 1980s he had prior to teaming up with Hawk. On the March 17 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Animal lost to Hardy in a [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] qualifying match.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/060317.html|title=SmackDown! — March 17, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal was defeated by [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Chris Benoit]] on the March 31 episode of ''SmackDown!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/060331.html|title=SmackDown! — March 31, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final WWE match, Animal defeated [[Paul Burchill]] on the May 6, 2006, episode of ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/06.htm|title=WWE Show Results 2006|accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|quote=(May 2, 2006) Road Warrior Animal defeated Paul Birchill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2006, Animal was released from his WWE contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/16973|title=WWE News: Sabu vs. Cena, RVD vs. Rey, Animal released, Rock movie update|accessdate=April 17, 2007|first=Wade|last=Keller|authorlink=Wade Keller|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=WWE.com announced that Road Warrior Animal has been released|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101185901/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/16973 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWE announced on March 28, 2011, on ''WWE Raw'' that the Road Warriors would be inducted into the 2011 Hall of Fame. Animal also spoke openly about his future induction on Right After Wrestling just minutes after the announcement on ''WWE Raw''. Animal told hosts, [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jim Korderas]] that the WWE was going to create a physical Hall of Fame in Tampa and he was going to donate his trademarked 'spiked-shoulder pads' to that Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729100940/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |archivedate=July 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the July 20, 2012, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' on [[Syfy]], Animal returned to face [[Heath Slater]] in honor of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'''s 1,000th episode. He went on to squash Slater. He then reappeared on the actual 1,000th episode on July 23 with other WWE Legends to help [[Amy Dumas|Lita]] take down Slater.

==Writing==
In 2011, Laurinaitis co-wrote an autobiography with William Andrew Wright titled ''The Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling'', published by Medallion Press, Inc. The book talks about the rise of The Road Warriors, shares funny stories of life on the road, and offers behind-the-scenes accounts of the wrestling industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/road-warriors-danger-death-and-the-rush-of-wrestling/oclc/705538223 ''The Road Warriors : Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling'', from WorldCat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Laurinaitis and his former wife Julie, a former powerlifter and bodybuilder, have two children, son [[James Laurinaitis|James]] (born 1986) and daughter Jessica (born 1989). Laurinaitis also has a son named Joseph (born 1981) from a previous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cache:XXJSnT14NfQJ:http://www.wmur.com/entertainment/3278968/detail.html He lived with his ex- wife, Julia and their two children, James, and Jessica, in suburban Minneapolis.

Laurinaitis' brothers have both been involved in professional wrestling over the years. [[John Laurinaitis]] (Johnny Ace) is the former Executive Vice President of Talent Relations for [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] and a former wrestler. [[The Terminator (wrestler)|Marcus Laurinaitis]] is a former wrestler, mainly known as one half of the tag team ''The Wrecking Crew'' (Terminator / Fury).

Laurinaitis' son, [[James Laurinaitis]], played [[linebacker]] for the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State University]]. As a sophomore, James won the [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]], given to the best defensive player in the country, and was a finalist for the [[Butkus Award]], which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/laurinaitis_james00.html|title=Player Bio: James Laurinaitis : Football| accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' made a joke about borrowing his father's shoulder pads and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/players/11/14/first.person1120/index.html?section=si_latest|title=SI Players: First Person James Laurinaitis, Ohio State Linebacker|accessdate=April 19, 2007| first=Elisabeth|last=Newman | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted by the [[St. Louis Rams]] in the second round as the 35th overall pick in the [[2009 NFL Draft]], and played with the Rams through the team's final season in St. Louis in [[2015 St. Louis Rams season|2015]], after which he moved to the [[New Orleans Saints]].

In July 2016, Laurinaitis was named part of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury.  The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE sued in wrestler class action lawsuit featuring Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka, Paul ‘Mr Wonderful’ Orndorff|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/what-the-fox/wwe-sued-in-wrestler-class-action-lawsuit-featuring-jimmy-superfly-snuka-paul-mr-wonderful-orndorff/news-story/079fbd7db16f9cd71b7b569672baa4a5|work=[[FoxSports.com]]|date=July 18, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]] ([[21st Century Fox]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; US District Judge [[Vanessa Lynne Bryant]] dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/19/lawsuit-against-wwe-concussions-thrown-out/| title= Judge throws out lawsuit against WWE by ex-pro wrestlers over concussions|last=Collins|first=Dave|work= [[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=October 22, 2018| date= September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The Road Warriors reign with the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, with Genichiro Tenryu, began December 7, 1988 after Ted Turner's purchase of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling from Jim Crockett Jr. and having it renamed World Championship Wrestling.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Hawk and Animal's reign with this championship also happened after Ted Turner bought and renamed the promotion. However, it took place before the title was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship.&lt;/small&gt;

[[File:OpenIndiana 2015 Console LS.png|thumb|View of the root directory in the [[OpenIndiana]] operating system]]

In a [[Computing|computer]] [[file system]], and primarily used in the [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, the '''root directory''' is the first or top-most [[Directory (computing)|directory]] in a hierarchy.  It can be likened to the trunk of a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]], as the starting point where all branches originate from.  The '''root file system''' is the file system contained on the same [[disk partition]] on which the root directory is located; it is the filesystem on top of which all other file systems are [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] as the system [[Booting|boots up]].

==Metaphor==
To use the example of a physical file cabinet, if the separate drawers in the file cabinet are represented as the highest level of [[Directory (computing)|sub-directories]] in the file system or system prompt, then the room the file cabinet is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most [[operating system]]s, [[Computer file|files]] can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any file cabinet within the room.

==Multiple root directories==
Unix abstracts the nature of this tree hierarchy entirely and in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems the root directory is denoted by the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (slash) sign. Though the root directory is conventionally referred to as &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, the directory entry itself has no name{{snd}}  its name is the "empty" part before the initial directory separator character (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). All filesystem entries, including [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] [[filesystem]]s are "branches" of this root.

Under [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], and [[Microsoft Windows]], each [[Disk partition|partition]] has a [[drive letter assignment]] (labeled &lt;code&gt;C:\&lt;/code&gt; for a particular partition C) and there is no common root directory above that. DOS, OS/2, and Windows do support more abstract hierarchies, with partitions mountable within a directory of another drive, though this is rarely seen. This has been possible in DOS through the command &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; since it first was added to DOS, and can be achieved in all Windows versions as well. In some contexts, it is also possible to refer to a root directory containing all mounted drives, although it cannot contain files directly as it does not exist on any file system. For instance, when linking to a local file using the "file:" [[URI scheme]], the syntax is of the form "&lt;code&gt;file:///C:/...&lt;/code&gt;", where "&lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt;" is the standard prefix, and the third '&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;' represents the root of the local system.

In UNIX-like operating systems, each [[Process (computing)|process]] has its own idea of what the root directory is.  For most processes this is the same as the system's actual root directory, but it can be changed by calling the &lt;tt&gt;[[chroot]]&lt;/tt&gt; [[system call]].  This is typically done to create secluded environment to run software that requires legacy libraries and sometimes to simplify software installation and debugging. Chroot is not meant to be used for enhanced security as the processes inside can break out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/252794/ |title=What chroot() is really for |publisher=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; FreeBSD offers a stronger [[FreeBSD jail|jail()]] system call that enables [[operating-system-level virtualization]] and also serves security purposes to restrict which files a process may access to just a subset of the file system hierarchy.

==Super-root==
Some Unix systems support a directory below the root directory. Normally, "/.." points back to the same inode as "/", however, under {{Interlanguage link multi|MUNIX|de}}, this can be changed to point to a super-root directory, where remote trees can be mounted.&lt;ref name="Newcastle_1982"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Newcastle Connection |author-last1=Brownbridge |author-first1=David R. |author-last2=Marshall |author-first2=Lindsay F. |author-last3=Randell |author-first3=Brian |author-link3=Brian Randell |journal=Software – Practice and Experience |volume=12 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/spe.4380121206 |pages=1147–1162 |url=http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/articles/papers/399.pdf |access-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816184205/http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/articles/papers/399.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Callaghan_2000"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Callaghan |author-first=Brent |title=NFS Illustrated |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-201-32570-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If, for example, two workstations "pcs2a" and "pcs2b" were connected via "connectnodes" and "uunite" startup script, "/../pcs2b" could be used to access the root directory of "pcs2b" from "pcs2a". {{Seealso|Newcastle Connection|Network block device}}

The '''''{{lang|la|Sermo Lupi ad Anglos}}''''' ('The [[Sermon]] of the Wolf to the English') is the title given to a [[homily]] composed in [[England]] between 1010-1016 by [[Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York]] (died 1023), who commonly styled himself ''{{lang|la|Lupus}}'', or 'wolf' after the first element in his name [''{{lang|ang|wulf-stan}}'' = 'wolf-stone']. Though the title is [[Latin]], the work itself is written in [[Old English]]. The ''{{lang|la|Sermo Lupi}}'' is Wulfstan's most [[Works of Wulfstan of York|well-known work]]. In it, he blames a lack of moral discipline amongst his fellow [[Anglo-Saxon England|English]] as the source of God's anger against the English, which has taken the shape of thirty years of [[Viking]] raids against England. Wulfstan exhorts the English to behave in a manner more pleasing to God, and specifically to live according to the laws of the Church and of the king. The ''{{lang|la|Sermo Lupi}}'' is noted for its [[rhetoric]]al achievements, and is considered to represent the height of Wulfstan's skill as a [[homilist]] and [[rhetor]].&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, "Wulfstan (died 1023)."&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the ''{{lang|la|Sermo Lupi}}'' has been critically edited many times, most recently by Dorothy Bethurum.&lt;ref&gt;Bethurum, ed., ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', pp. 255-75; Bethurum prints three versions, each numbered 'XX'.&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains one of several mentions of Old English ''{{lang|ang|wælcyrian}}'', a term cognate to the [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|valkyrjur}}''—[[valkyries]].

==Historical context==
{{Main|Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York}}

Wulfstan's past is obscure, though it is possible that he began his ecclesiastical career as a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, ''The Monastic Order in England'', p. 64; Whitelock, "Archbishop Wulfstan, Homilist and Statesman", p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; We know that he became [[Bishop of London]] in 996, perhaps already aged nearly 50.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, "Archbishop Wulfstan: Eleventh-Century State-Builder", p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1002 he was simultaneously promoted to [[Bishop of Worcester]], and [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, "A Note on the Career of Wulfstan the Homilist", p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; He held both [[episcopal see|sees]] in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester. He remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was Bishop of London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, perhaps specifically on the topic of [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ed., ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'', pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Archbishop of York, Wulfstan's administrative duties were considerable. In addition to tending the spiritual and financial needs of the religious and secular communities of the North of England, he was deeply involved in the vital politics of the South. He was one of the most important members of king [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred II]]'s advisory council, known as the [[Witan]], and as such was active in all the most significant political decisions of the day. By 1008 he had secured the privilege of drafting the official royal legislation promulgated by the king and the Witan. He was deeply concerned with legislation, holding that good laws were essential if a people were to prosper. He continued as the king's chief legal draftsman on into the reign of the Danish king [[Cnut the Great]]. It is both remarkable and puzzling that Wulfstan was able to play so central a role in politics under both Æthelred's and Cnut's reigns, especially as it was under Æthelred's reign that Wulfstan, in his ''Sermo Lupi'', so vehemently decried the depredations of the Danish and [[Norway|Norwegian]] Vikings.

{{Main|Æthelred the Unready}}

King Æthelred II&amp;nbsp;— nicknamed Æthelred 'The Unready' - ruled England from 978-1016. For virtually his entire reign, England was the object of successive Viking raids. Between the period of 980-1016, few areas of southern England remained unscathed as first Viking raiding parties, then entire Viking armies looted and ravaged the English countryside.&lt;ref name="Keynes 1016"&gt;Keynes, "Æthelred II (c.966x8–1016)."&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelred, roundly criticised by historians as ineffectual in the face of the Viking onslaught, was never able to mount a successful offense against the nimble Viking fleets, and his efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking armies were continually undermined. Æthelred and his advisors eventually adopted a policy of buying off the Viking armies with money. These enormous payments, known as [[Danegeld]], had to be levied against English landowners and citizens, and this had a devastating impact on the English economy. Together, the Viking raids and the Danegeld payments brought the English people to their knees. But the Viking assaults continued. Few Englishmen during this time would have seen any reason to be optimistic about his own future or that of his countrymen. The situation became desperate in 1013, when, despite Æthelred, a prominent leader of the Viking armies, [[Swein Forkbeard]], managed to position himself as king of England. In response, Æthelred retreated to [[Normandy]] where he remained until Swein's death the following year, upon which he immediately negotiated his safe return to England and his reinstatement as king.&lt;ref name="Keynes 1016"/&gt; It is of these events that one of the versions of the ''Sermo Lupi'' makes mention. Wulfstan's role in these events are unclear, though sentiments he expresses elsewhere in his writings suggest that he would have supported Æthelred's cause over any Dane's. [[Dorothy Whitelock]] writes that "we have no evidence where Wulfstan was at the time of the submission [of England to Swein], but he was at [[York]] within a [[fortnight]] of [Swegn's] death, and we may suspect that he used his influence to win back the province to the English king Æthelred."&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship and dating==
Though Wulfstan's name is never directly attached to the '''Sermo Lupi'', there is no question of Wulfstan's authorship. The text of the ''Sermo Lupi'' has survived [https://archive.is/20121214191513/http://english3.fsu.edu/~wulfstan/bib.html in five manuscripts], a number of which associate the homily with Wulfstan's ''nom de plume'', ''Lupus''. The five manuscripts represent the text in three versions, one shorter and two longer.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'', pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that the shorter version is the original, and that one of the longer versions is a later authorial revision; that is, Wulfstan composed the homily, then later re-worked and expanded it. These versions thus provide an opportunity to study the practices of an Old English writer as he revises his own work.

The longer version, which Wulfstan probably revised himself, exists in a manuscript known to have been annotated and worked over by the archbishop;&lt;ref&gt;Ker, "The Handwriting of Archbishop Wulfstan", pp. 321-24.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, there are many corrections to the ''Sermo Lupi'' in this manuscript which were carried out by Wulfstan's own pen. The [[rubric]], or title, for the ''Sermo Lupi'' in this manuscript reads: ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos, quod fuit anno millesimo XIIII ab incarnatione Domini nostri Iesu Cristi'', 'The sermon of the Wolf to the English at the time when the Danes [Vikings] harried them, which was in the 1014th year from the birth of  Jesus Christ.' Thus the date at which the revision was made was probably 1014.&lt;ref&gt;Godden, "Apocalypse and Invasion in Late Anglo-Saxon England", pp. 143-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the year that Æthelred returned to England from Normandy and resumed his position as king of the English. It is also the year of a great royal council, at which Æthelred and his Witan published a new law code.&lt;ref&gt;"VIII Æthelred", in Liebermann, ed., ''Die Gesetze der Angelsaschen'', pp. 263-68.&lt;/ref&gt; There is good reason to associate these events with a special oral delivery of the ''Sermo Lupi'' by Wulfstan to the re-constituted English [[Witenagemot|Witan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wilcox, "Wulfstan's ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' as Political Performance: 16 February 1014 and Beyond", in Matthew Townend (ed.), ''Wulfstan, Archbishop of York: The Proceedings of the second Alcuin Conference'', Studies in the Early Middle Ages 10 (Turnhout, 2004), pp. 375-96.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems significant that the ''Sermo Lupi'' specifically mentions Æthelred's exile, recalling it with regret.

==Rhetorical style and technique==

Wulfstan not only abstractly discussed the correlation between the Viking invasions and the anger of God, but also explicitly stated the types of acts that God would find condemnable. In order to emphasize the severity of their situation, Wulfstan employed a variety of rhetorical techniques to elicit a sense of urgency (phrase repetition, metaphorical language, etc.). Rather than suggesting a unified stance against the Vikings, he implored his congregation/English population to abandon the behaviors of plundering, selling one another into slavery, betraying one's lord, buying women for sexual gratification, breaking religious and moral pledges, praising false gods, and a variety of other deplorable acts. Wulfstan, however, articulated that it was still possible to avoid the apocalypse/wrath of God, if they steered away from the devil and instead remain obedient and respectful to the Almighty.

Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan's homilies their tempo-driven, almost feverish quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes.&lt;ref&gt;See discussions in Bethurum, ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', pp. 87-98, and Angus McIntosh, ''Wulfstan's Prose''.&lt;/ref&gt; The genius of his style is based chiefly on sound and parallelsim. The passage below, taken from the ''Sermo Lupi'', employs numerous rhetorical devices, including [[alliteration]], [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]], [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]], and [[rhyme]]:

:Therefore it is clear and well seen in all of us that we have previously more often transgressed than we have amended, and therefore much is greatly assailing this nation. Nothing has prospered now for a long time either at home or abroad, but there has been military devastation and hunger, burning and bloodshed in nearly every district time and again. And stealing and slaying, plague and pestilence, [[murrain]] and disease, malice and hate, and the robbery by robbers have injured us very terribly.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Ser, ''The Electronic Sermo Lupi ad Anglos''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
The ''Sermo Lupi'', as with all of Wulfstan's literary works, is known for its frequent, almost habitual, use of intensifying phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Bethurum, ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the passage above include ''oft &amp; gelome'' "often and frequently" and ''swyþe þearle'' "very terribly." Other intensifying phrases frequently used by Wulfstan, in the ''Sermo Lupi'' and in other of his works, are ''ealles to swyðe'' "altogether too much", ''georne'' "eagerly", ''mide rihte'' "in right manner", ''for Gode and for worulde'' "for God and for world", among others. Famously, Wulfstan often created long 'lists of sinners', wherein he joined a series terms (of compound words, and often used by no-one else) into groups using alliteration. One of the most famous examples is found in the ''Sermo Lupi'':

{|

:&lt;small&gt;Old English&lt;/small&gt;
:Her syndan þurh synleawa, awa hit þincan mæg, sare gelewede to manege on earde. Her syndan mannslagan and mægslagan and mæsserbanan and mynsterhatan; and her syndan mansworan and morþorwyrhtan; and her syndan myltestran and bearnmyrðran and fule forlegene horingas manegel and her syndan [[Witch (etymology)|wiccan]] and [[Valkyrie#Old English attestations|wælcyrian]]; and her syndan ryperas and reaferas and woroldstruderas; and, hrædest is to cweþenne, mana and misdæd ungerim ealra.&lt;ref name=TREHARNE232&gt;Treharne (2004:232).&lt;/ref&gt;

:Here, so it might seem, too many in the land are sorely injured by the wounds of sin: here are man-slayers, and killers of kinsmen, and murderers of priests, and enemies of monasteries, and here are cruel perjurers and murderers, and here are whores and child-killers, and many foul fornicating adulterers, and here are [[witch]]es and [[Valkyrie]]s, and here are robbers and plunderers, and mighty despoilers, and, to speak briefly, numberless kinds of crime and every misdeed.&lt;ref name=ORCHARD184&gt;Orchard (1997:184).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}

A similar device is at work in his list of afflictions in the first passage given above (''here &amp; hunger, bryne &amp; blodgyte ... stalu &amp; cwalu, stric &amp; steorfa, orfcwealm &amp; uncoþu, hol &amp; hete...''). The ''Sermo Lupi'' is considered to excel particularly in the use of repetition as a rhetorical device .&lt;ref&gt;Bethurum, ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', pp. 355-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other devices which have been noticed in Wulfstan's works are ''[[dubitatio]]'' and ''[[verborum exornatio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bethurum, ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', pp. 90-92.&lt;/ref&gt; His works are almost completely without metaphor and simile, and Wulfstan as a rule shies away from narrative and descriptions of the particular.&lt;ref&gt;Bethurum, ''The Homilies of Wulfstan'', pp. 91, 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sermo Lupi'' is one of his only works where description (i.e. of the moral decline of the nation) plays a significant role.

Wulfstan's ''Sermo Lupi'' also employs the rhetorical device known as ''[[Ubi sunt]]'' (Latin, "where are... ?"), a common [[medieval]] literary [[refrain]] used "to designate a mood or theme in literature of lament for the mutability of things."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition, ''s.v.'' ubi sunt.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the refrain never properly arises in the ''Sermo Lupi'' (in English nor in Latin), the theme is nevertheless vigorously active as Wulfstan presents the cherished goods and virtues of the past as lost in the present due to the moral decline of Men and the world through time.

==Primary themes==
*The world nears its end, and worsens every day as the time of [[Antichrist]] approaches. The [[Devil]] has led the English nation astray. Evil and injustice fill the land and none seeks a remedy. We have suffered much, yet we have deserved much. Even in [[Paganism|heathen]] lands offerings are made to gods, but here we have stripped the Church and her servants of honour and of wealth. Since [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]]'s death, the laws of England have greatly deteriorated. [[sanctuary|Sanctuaries]] are violated, [[widows]] are forced to marry unjustly, and many are made poor and taken advantage of and sold into [[slavery]] abroad. Children are enslaved for stealing, and the rights of citizens and slaves are taken away. God's own laws and teachings are hated. We are disgraced through God's anger, and it will become worse for us unless we seek His protection.
*Much afflicts the nation, and no one prospers. Violence, hunger, pestilence, hate, and theft are rampant. Heavy [[taxation]] afflicts everyone. Storms ruin crops. The ties of [[kinship]] are no longer meaningful. We have made our own desires into law, and have ignored true law. Everyone seeks to betray and insult his neighbour. A lord is betrayed by his own men. The worst crime is to betray one's lord to death or to drive him from the land. Both have occurred here recently: King [[Edward the Martyr|Edward]] was murdered and burned, and King [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred]] was driven from his own kingdom. Innocent people have been slaughtered too often. Rich men frequently neglect to upkeep religious houses.
*It is terrible to know that men often jointly purchase a woman, ravage her like dogs, and then sell her again to their enemies. Fathers sell their sons for profit, and sons their mothers. Too many perjure themselves and break [[oaths]]. A slave will flee his master to become [[Viking]], and gains more honour thereby than his previous master keeps. We disgracefully pay off our enemies, and the English are continually defeated. [[Pirates]] are made strong, and one of them can drive away ten of our own, so afflicted are we with sin. Our lot is misery and public shame for we honour those who injure us and pay who humiliate us.
*The nation is corrupted through [[vice]]. Crimes of every sort are perpetrated. Men are more ashamed now of good deeds than of evil ones. On account of [[pride]] no one repents of their [[sins]], though books tell us to. We must seek remedy through [[repentance]] if we are to protect ourselves from God's anger, lest we suffer the fate of the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]]. The Britons were also afflicted with too many sins, and did not call out against evil when they saw it. Through their pride they angered God and he made foreigners (then the [[Anglo-Saxons]]) invade this island and take it from them.
*Thus let us turn to what is right and abandon wickedness. Let us follow God's laws and the king's, and atone for our wrongdoings. Let us behave as we promised we would at [[baptism]]. Let us keep oaths and be loyal to each other, and think about the [[Final Judgement]] and save ourselves from the torments of eternal fire; let us gain for ourselves instead the eternal rewards of [[Heaven]].

In the sermon, Wulfstan addresses the entire English nation and holds it accountable for the country's plight. A key element of Wulfstan's sermon was the connection he made between the initial Anglo-Saxon rulers of England (who drove out the Britons from the country) and the Danes who were currently plaguing the country.  According to [[Gildas]], the Britons had been defeated because they had sinned against God. God had therefore allowed them to be vanquished. Wulfstan warns his listeners to learn from the past, and not share the fate of the Britons.

The Sermon of the Wolf is one of many homilies that attribute the Viking raids to the anger of God. In understanding this text as part of Old English homilies that equated and analyzed physical events and natural processes with transcendental forces, modern audiences can observe Christian theology firmly manifesting itself in the psychology of the English population (a theology that most would have been unaware of only a few centuries earlier.) Inadvertently, such types of evocative speeches/texts presented the English as their own worst enemy, ultimately culminating in a passive response toward Viking conquests as they were not the source of their plagues. This attitude thus allowed the Danes to proceed further inland and form their own settlements in various regions.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The sermon has been regarded as "an invaluable witness to the dismal state of affairs in Æthelred's reign", as it is one of the only contemporary documents which describes the effects of the Viking invasions in the beginning of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Keynes, "An Abbot, and Archbishop, and the Viking Raids of 1006-7 and 1009-12", ''Anglo-Saxon England'' 36 (2007): 151-220, at p. 203; Keynes, "The Declining Reputation of King Æthelred the Unready", in David Hill (ed.), ''Ethelred the Unready: Papers from the Millenary Conference, British Archaeological Reports'', British Series 59 (1978), pp. 227-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC. April 200bbc3. Retrieved 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiayoungreadermedal.org|title=California Young Reader Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's plot revolves around Alex Rider being secretly recruited into MI6 to investigate the Stormbreaker computer factory and stop a terrorist attack that will kill hundreds of thousands of British school children.

A [[Stormbreaker (film)|film adaptation]], starring [[Alex Pettyfer]] as Alex Rider, was released in 2006.

==Summary==
The book begins with [[Alex Rider (character)|Alex Rider]] learning that his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, has been killed in a car crash. Unknown to Alex and his housekeeper, Jack Starbright, Ian's job as a banker was actually a cover for his role as an MI6 agent. Alex becomes suspicious upon being told that Ian had not been wearing his seat belt and discovering that Ian's office has been emptied out. He finds his uncle's car at a wrecking yard, and discovers that his uncle had been murdered, being shot several times. After a near escape from a car crusher, Alex is asked to visit Ian's former employers, ostensibly a bank called "The Royal &amp; General". He breaks into Ian's office at the bank, discovering evidence of his uncle's double life before he is knocked out by a drugged dart.

After waking up, Alex meets MI6 head Alan Blunt and his deputy, Mrs Tulip Jones. They reveal the truth about his uncle's job, and explain that they had sent Ian to investigate Herod Sayle, a wealthy Lebanese (Egyptian in American adaptations) businessman who has developed a revolutionary new computer, the Stormbreaker. Sayle plans to give a free Stormbreaker to every secondary school in the United Kingdom, accompanied by a grand activation ceremony in [[the Science Museum]], supposedly as a gesture of thanks for the country taking him in when he was a child, after a wealthy American couple sent him to England after he saved their lives in Olive Street. In his last communication with them, Ian had warned MI6 that the Stormbreakers could not be allowed to leave Sayle's manufacturing plant, but before he could explain, he was assassinated by Yassen Gregorovich, a professional killer supposedly working for Sayle, on the return to London.

Intending to use him to covertly investigate Sayle, MI6 recruits Alex by essentially blackmailing him; if he does not co-operate, Jack will be deported back to America, his house will be sold and he will leave his school and friends for an institute until he is of age. They put him through a gruelling eleven-day long stint at an SAS training camp (which MI6 also uses), before deploying him to Herod Sayle's base in Cornwall, using the alias of another boy, Felix Lester, who won a competition to visit the plant and be the first child to use a Stormbreaker. To aid him in his mission, Alex is given a grappling hook disguised as a yo-yo, acne cream capable of dissolving metal, and a [[Nintendo Gameboy]] which functions as a transmitter, smoke screen, surveillance camera and microphone and bug detector, by MI6 agent Smithers.

Sayle shows Alex around his mock-Victorian mansion, which houses a large jellyfish aquarium containing a giant [[Portuguese Man o' War]], located in his office. Alex also meets Mr. Grin, a butler and henchman whose name derives from his time as a circus performer, catching knives with his teeth. An accident in his hometown left him without a tongue and two large scars, which give him the appearance of constant smiling.

Initially the trip goes well, with Alex finding a cryptic diagram made by his Uncle Ian in the canopy of his four-poster bed. However, Sayle grows to dislike Alex, firstly after Alex is discovered in a restricted area of the base, and later when Alex defeats Sayle in a game of snooker. While investigating the base at night, Alex sees several of Sayle's agents unloading metal cases with great care from a Chinese nuclear submarine at the local port, with Yassen supervising. When one of the agents drops a metal case, he is promptly shot dead by Yassen. The next afternoon, Alex decides to visit Port Tallon, the nearby village, but finds himself attacked by a pair of armed guards on quad bikes. He survives by tricking the guards into crashing: one collides with an electric fence while the other falls from a cliff face.

While searching the library, Alex finds a map in a book about tin mining which matches the diagram left by Ian, discovering that Sayle's land once belonged to Sir Rupert Dozmary, a tin-mining magnate. He also learns that Ian had borrowed several books about viruses, and assumes that Sayle plans to use the Stormbreaker network to release a computer virus into Britain's computer infrastructure. Alex investigates the Dozmary mine and, following the path left by his uncle, discovers a large computer manufacturing facility, where the Stormbreaker computers are being filled with a strange fluid. Alex realises that the 'viruses' being investigated by Ian were not computer viruses, but biological weapons. Alex is detected, and nearly escapes but is eventually caught and tranquilised. When he comes to, Sayle explains to Alex his plan.

When Sayle attended school, he was bullied because of his accent and skin colour. The worst bully was none other than the future Prime Minister, leading him to despise English children, and all of Britain in general. As a result, Sayle plans to take revenge on the Prime Minister and Britain with his "April Fools Joke"; when the computers are activated by the Prime Minister, the virus, a potent, nearly unstoppable strain of smallpox, will be released into every school in the country, killing every schoolchild and teacher in England as well as those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Alex is then left handcuffed to a chair, until Nadia Vole, an assistant of Sayle's, frees him, claiming that she is a fellow spy who worked with Ian Rider. However, as they head to find a mobile phone to call MI6 and inform them of Sayle's plan, she triggers a trapdoor which drops Alex into the jellyfish tank and stays behind to watch him die. Alex eventually gets free by using the acne cream gadget to damage the tank's supporting iron girders, causing it to rupture and sending thousands of gallons of water crashing into the room. Unfortunately for Vole, she was directly in front of the tank when it burst, releasing the immense jellyfish and causing it to land right on her, killing her painfully and instantly. Snatching up a harpoon gun, Alex rushes outside to find that Sayle's private helicopter has already left, leaving only a cargo plane on the tarmac. Using the handle of the harpoon gun, Alex knocks out a guard, taking his jeep and pistol. As he starts the jeep, several other jeeps start to pursue him as the cargo plane starts to take off. Through some fancy driving and good fortune, Alex manages to cause the destruction of the hostile jeeps. Tying the nylon cord of the yo-yo gadget to the harpoon with the yo-yo clipped to his belt, Alex shoots the harpoon which catches on the underbelly of the airborne plane. Using the gadget, he gets himself on to the plane where he confronts the pilot, who is none other than Mr. Grin. Alex instructs Mr. Grin to fly to London by threatening him with the pistol.

When they are finally over London, Alex realises that there is not much time left before noon. He spots several parachutes and uses one to jump off the plane. Mr. Grin turns the plane around hoping to ram into Alex. Alex pulls out the Game Boy Color and activates a cartridge disguised as a game called "Bomber Boy", which activates a smoke bomb that he left on the plane. Unable to see, Mr. Grin loses control of the plane and fatally crashes into a dock near the River Thames. Alex crashes through the roof of the Science Museum and dangles from his parachute which had gotten caught on a beam. Alex draws the gun he took from a guard back at Sayle's mansion and fires blindly at the Stormbreaker computer, one accidentally hitting the Prime Minister and Sayle himself being struck by two more, though he inexplicably vanishes. Mrs. Jones saves Alex's life by ordering security not to open fire on him. MI6 immediately recalls all the computers, citing "safety issues".

Later, after a debriefing by Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones, Alex enters a taxi. The driver is in fact Sayle who holds Alex at gunpoint. He leads Alex to the top of a building where he is about to shoot Alex, but is himself shot by Yassen Gregorovich, who lands in a helicopter. When Alex questions Yassen about why he shot Sayle, Yassen explains that Sayle had "become an embarrassment to [[Scorpia (novel)|the people he (Yassen) works for]]", so he had to be eliminated. Knowing that he is facing his uncle's killer, Alex tells Yassen he will one day kill him, but Yassen brushes aside the comment and tells Alex to drop the spy business and become a normal schoolboy again, before leaving in the helicopter.

The '''Vaughan Williams Memorial Library''' ('''VWML''') is the library and archive of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS), located in the society's London headquarters, [[Cecil Sharp House]]. It is a multi-media library comprising books, periodicals, audio-visual materials, photographic images and sound recordings, as well as manuscripts, field notes, transcriptions etc. of a number of the most distinguished collectors of [[folk music]] and dance traditions in the [[British Isles]]. According to ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'', "... by a gradual process of professionalization the VWML has become the most important concentration of material on traditional song, dance, and music in the country."  It is named after [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], the composer, collector and past president of the EFDSS, who died in 1958.

Prior to that it was known as the [[Cecil Sharp]] Library, since his books constituted the bulk of the original holdings, but over the years the library has added literature, sound and manuscript collections of other eminent folklorists and collectors such as [[Lucy Broadwood]], [[Janet Blunt]], [[Anne Gilchrist (collector)|Anne Gilchrist]], [[George Butterworth]], the Hammond brothers and [[George R. Gardiner|George Gardiner]]. It also contains copies of the papers and notebooks of [[Sabine Baring-Gould]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], Alfred Williams and [[James Madison Carpenter]]; and the field recordings of [[Percy Grainger]], Mike Yates and the [[BBC Folk Music Archive]].

Subjects covered include: [[folk songs|Folk/traditional/popular song]], [[Child Ballads]], [[Broadside (music)|Broadside ballads]], Industrial/occupational songs, [[sea chanties|sea songs/shanties]], singing games, [[Nursery rhymes]], Street cries, [[Carols]]/[[hymns]], [[Round (music)|Rounds]]/[[Glee (music)|glees/part songs]], [[Music hall]], Ritual/ceremonial dance, [[Morris dance]]/[[sword dance]] and a great deal more.

==Online Archive==

In May 2006, VWML Online was launched which hosts a number of the library's indexes to manuscript collections, together with its index to mummers' plays and the [[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud Folk Song]] and Broadside Indexes, the largest of their kind in the English language.

The online material has been extended with the addition of a catalogue of the collection of books bequeathed by the eminent folk music scholar, Leslie Shepard. It is planned to extend this catalogue with the other available electronic media in the archive before converting the existing card catalogues.

The archives of six of the UK's most prominent folk song collectors are also available on-line as the "Take 6 archive" including both their indexes and over 22,000 images of collected material including over 5,000 songs.

Finally, both Cecil Sharp's Appalachian diaries from 1915-1918 (in manuscript and transcript form) and over 300 images taken from his photographic collection are available for viewing on-line. The latter are largely portraits of contributors to his music collections from North America and England.

'''Whelan v Waitaki Meats Ltd''' 
(1990) ERNZ Sel Co 960; [1991] 2 NZLR 74  is a cited case in New Zealand distinguishing that [[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd]] prohibition of the awarding of damages for distress only applies to commercial contracts, and not to employment contracts.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |pages=276–277, 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Whelen started employment at Waitaki Meats in 1959, and after 29 years of working for them, he was suddenly notified that his employment was being terminated in 4 days, although this was later extended to 16 days.
Whelan found that the relatively short notice of his termination implied to the community at large that he had been dismissed for misconduct.
Consequently, he sued for wrongful dismissal, and also claimed $200,000 in damages for distress for the way his employment was suddenly terminated.
Waitaki defended the matter that under the 1909 case of [[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd]], the courts were unable to award compensation for distress, humiliation, etc., in employment cases.

==Held==
The court found the manner of Whelan's termination ''"was such as to cause the plaintiff undue mental distress, anxiety, humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to his feelings"''. and awarded $50,000 in damages, which was a departure from Addis v Gramophone, although it was awarded for breach of contract rather than under tort. On this, Gallen J said "''Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd is no more than an illustration of a principle that in commercial contracts such damages are inappropriate as not being enforceable''".

'''Footnote:''' Section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relationships Act 2000 now specifically allows the court to grant damages for humiliation and injury to feelings.

'''Xavier Marmier''' (22 June 1808{{snd}}12 October 1892) was a French author born in [[Pontarlier]], in [[Doubs]]. He had a passion for travelling, and this he combined throughout his life with the production of literature. After journeying in [[Switzerland]], Belgium and the [[Netherlands]], he was attached in 1835 to the Arctic expedition of the ''Recherche''; and after a couple of years at [[Rennes]] as professor of foreign literature, he visited (1842) Russia, (1845) [[Syria]], (1846) [[Algeria]], (1848–1849) North America and South America, and numerous volumes from his pen were the result.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|title=Marmier, Xavier |volume=17 |page=744 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/744/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 he was elected to the [[Académie française|Academy]] (Seat 31), and he was for many years prominently identified with the Sainte-Geneviève library. He did much to encourage the study of [[Scandinavian literature]] in France, publishing translations of [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]], [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger|Oehlenschlager]] and others. He died in Paris in 1892.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
