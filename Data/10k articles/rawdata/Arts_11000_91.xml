This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1644'''.

==Events==
*[[April 15]] – The second [[Globe Theatre]] is demolished by the [[Puritan]] government to make room for new housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Globe Theater History and Timeline|url=http://www.william-shakespeare.info/william-shakespeare-old-globe-theatre-history-timeline.htm|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*With the London theatres closed by the Puritan regime, playwriting activity shifts to [[closet drama]]. The publication of an anonymous satire against Archbishop [[William Laud]], titled ''Canterbury His Change of Diet'', is one mark of the shift.

'''Airline timetables''' are printed pamphlets or folders that many [[airlines]] have traditionally used to inform passengers of several different things, such as schedules, fleet, security, in-flight entertainment, food menus, baggage weight restrictions, and contact information.

Airline timetables used to be printed, multi-page pamphlets available at airport counters, or upon request by phone or mail. On January 16, 1928, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] published one of their first timetables. It read ''The air-way to [[Havana]], Pan American Airways, [[Pershing Square Building]], New York''. 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:CI timetable win07.jpg|left|230px|thumb|Timetable of [[China Airlines]] with their official spokesperson, the supermodel, [[Lin Chi-ling]] and flight attendants in new uniform on the cover {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

Many airline timetables had colorful covers. The timetables of very small airlines, such as [[Scenic Airways]], consisted of one sheet of paper, with their hub's flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back. 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:CX onlinetimetable.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Online timetable of [[Cathay Pacific]] Airways.Data shown on the picture are flights from [[Hong Kong International Airport]] to its secondary hub, [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] of [[Taipei]]{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In recent years, most airlines have stopped production of printed timetables, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only [[Internet|online]] (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a [[PDF]]), and the value of many printed airline timetable has risen among collectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">An '''alternative exhibition space''' is a space other than a traditional commercial venue used for the public exhibition of artwork. Often comprising a place converted from another use, such as a [[store front]], [[warehouse]], or [[factory loft]], it is then made into a display or performance space for use by an individual or group of artists. According to art advisor [[Allan Schwartzman]] "alternative spaces were the center of American artistic life in the '70s."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Brian Wallis, ''Public Funding and Alternative Spaces'' in [[Julie Ault]], ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'', University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p165. {{ISBN|0-8166-3794-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macdonald argues that such spaces emerged in the wake of art practices in the 1960s and 1970s that reacted against the presumed neutrality of the "white cube" gallery space.&lt;ref name=macdonald234&gt;Sharon Macdonald, ''A Companion to Museum Studies'', Blackwell publishing, 2006, p234. {{ISBN|1-4051-0839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent wave of alternative spaces in the United States occurred in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Atkins, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n11_v86/ai_21257947/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 ''On edge: alternative spaces today''], ''Art in America'', Nov, 1998, p2.&lt;/ref&gt; with the first spaces established in 1969, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE and Robert Newman's Gain Ground where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Philadelphia's [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Philadelphia. Some date the start of the tendency from 1970, when [[112 Greene Street]]&lt;ref name=wallis165&gt;Brian Wallis, ''Public Funding and Alternative Spaces'' in Julie Ault, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZzxqQqQk94C&amp;dq=Julie+Ault,+Alternative+Art,+New+York,+1965-1985&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RywSSrTqCZCk8QTWh-igBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA161,M1 Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985]'', University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p165. {{ISBN|0-8166-3794-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in [[New York City|New York]] and with the early curatorial work of [[Alanna Heiss]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Andrew M (May 2, 2008). "The Principal of P.S.1: Can Alanna Heiss’s vision for her museum outlast her?",[http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/46644/ New York Magazine], recovered on March 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Kitchen]] was established in New York in 1971. [[A.I.R. Gallery]] opened in September 1972 as an alternative space women's co-op gallery. About this time And/Or Gallery opened in Seattle, Washington, the first alternative space of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. It was founded by Anne Focke. [[Bonnie Sherk]]'s Crossroads Community (The Farm), another early alternative space, was established in [[San Francisco]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selz, ''Art of Engagement'', University of California Press, 2006, pp229-230. {{ISBN|0-520-24053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Real Art Ways]], in Hartford, Connecticut, was founded in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Atkins, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n11_v86/ai_21257947/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 ''On edge: alternative spaces today''], ''Art in America'', Nov, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave of alternative spaces that emerged in the US during the late 1960s through the mid-1970s were typically organized by collectives of artists whose interests were focused on conceptual art, mixed media, electronic media, diversity and performance art.&lt;ref name=wallis165/&gt; For instance, [[Franklin Furnace Archive]] in New York was established in 1976 by [[Martha Wilson]] to exhibit performance work.&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles, Peter Howard Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art'', University of California Press, 1996, p693. {{ISBN|0-520-20251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions|LACE]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Washington Project for the Arts]] showed performance and video work. One of the most enduring alternative spaces in New York, [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center|P.S 1]], was founded in 1976.&lt;ref name=macdonald234/&gt; [[Exit Art]] in Manhattan opened in 1982. In 1981 the [[New Museum]] staged the exhibition "Alternatives in Retrospect: An Historical Overview 1969-1975", guest curated by [[Jacki Apple]]. This exhibition looked at early New York alternative galleries, Gain Ground, Apple, 98 Greene Street, 112 Greene Street Workshop, 10 Blecker Street, Idea Warehouse and 3 Mercer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives in Retrospect exhibition|url=http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/39|work=New Museum website|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was documented with a publication and video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives in Retrospect publication|url=http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/6427|work=New Museum website|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives in Retrospect|url=http://www.vdb.org/titles/alternatives-retrospect|work=Video Data Bank|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Chicago, the exhibition ''Alternative Spaces'' curated by Lynne Warren at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] catalogued the scores of artists and artists' spaces to emerge during that period, including Artemisia Gallery (1973-2003), ARC Gallery (1973-), Gallery Bugs Bunny (1968-1972), N.A.M.E. Gallery (1973-1997), NAB Gallery (1974-1984), and [[Randolph Street Gallery]] (1979-1998).&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Lynne. 1984. ''Alternative spaces : a history in Chicago''. Chicago. Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier waves in Chicago produced the Hyde Park Art Center (1939-) and Contemporary Art Workshop (1950-2009), while later spaces included 1019 W. Lake St./Noise Factory (1981-1985), W.P.A. Gallery (1981-?) and Axe Street Arena (1985-1989). &lt;ref&gt;'Art Facts: Axe St. Arena's closing statement.' ''Chicago Reader''. 13 July 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of artists enacted those spaces, including [[Jim Nutt]], [[H.C. Westermann]], [[Ed Paschke]] (HPAC), [[Leon Golub]], [[Nancy Spero]] (CAC), [[Hollis Sigler]], [[Vera Klement]] (Artemisia), [[Phil Berkman]] and [[Gary Justis]] (N.A.M.E.).&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Lynne. 1984. 'Alternative spaces : a history in Chicago. Checklist of the Exhibition, June 23-August 19, 1984'. Chicago. Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the factors contributing to the demise of alternative spaces in the late 1980s in the USA was the reduction of public funding for artists and for the arts. With the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as President came a restructuring of federal supports, such as an end to the CETA program, through which some artists found employment, and restrictions placed upon the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, Joseph (26 September 1985). "NEA: The First 20 Years; Looking Back On the Up-and-Down Union of Government and Art". Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt; The net result of the rightward ideological movement in government – with its open hostility to non-traditional art – was that 'alternative artists' were not only de-funded, they and the galleries that featured them were prominently criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley et al.'' 524 U.S. 569 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500, 1998 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;'Mapplethorpe battle changed art world'. ''Cincinnati Enquirer''. 21 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, NEA funding was significantly reduced, and so was the number of non-profit galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Wallis, ''Public Funding and Alternative Spaces'' in Julie Ault, ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'', University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p164. {{ISBN|0-8166-3794-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
In Europe the culture of alternative exhibition spaces differs somewhat from the situation in the United States and has a strong root in the [[squatting]] [[counterculture]], which is not illegal in every European country. Also many countries have governmental art funding structures that support many off spaces. In [[the Netherlands]] there is [[OT301]], [[W139]] and [[ADM Amsterdam|ADM]] (all in Amsterdam), [[Roodkapje]] (Rotterdam), Nest (The Hague), [[Sign]] (Groningen). In the UK there is the [[MK Gallery]] in [[Milton Keynes]]. Belgium has [[Het Bos]] in [[Antwerp]]. Liebig 12 is an alternative exhibition space in [[Berlin]]. In [[Vienna]] there is Moë. [[Ljubljana]] has [[Metelkova]] with many alternative art spaces, and [[Copenhagen]] has alternative spaces in [[Freetown Christiania]]. Grand Palace is an alternative art space in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. [[Hirvitalo]] is in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

The '''Berlin Secession''' ({{lang-de|Berliner Secession}}) was an art association founded by [[Berlin]] artists in 1898 as an [[Secession|alternative]] to the conservative state-run [[Association of Berlin Artists]]. That year the official salon jury rejected a landscape by [[Walter Leistikow]], who was a key figure amongst a group of young artists interested in modern developments in art. Sixty-five young artists formed the initial membership of the Secession.

[[Max Liebermann]] was the Berlin Secession's first president, and he proposed to the Secession that [[Paul Cassirer]] and his cousin [[Bruno Cassirer|Bruno]] act as business managers.

In 1901 Bruno Cassirer resigned from the Secession, so that he could dedicate himself entirely to the Cassirer publishing firm. Paul took over the running of the Cassirer gallery, and supported various Secessionist artists including the sculptors [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[August Gaul]], as well as promoting French [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]].

The biggest conflict in the Berlin Secession was over the question of whether it should follow the new wave of [[Expressionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''The Boros Collection''' is a private collection of [[contemporary art]] by Karen and [[Christian Boros]], which has been on display since 2008 in a [[World War II]] era [[bunker]] (called the ''Reichsbahnbunker)'' in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/arts/12iht-bunker.1.6105187.html|title=In a Berlin war bunker, Christian Boros creates a showcase for art|last1=Tzortis|first1=Andreas|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The collection comprises artworks in the mediums of sculpture, photography and painting by international contemporary artists. The works are installed on five floors of the bunker, which the architect Jens Casper transformed into a compendium of individual rooms that interconnect on multiple floors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/270277/a-bunker-reborn|title=A Bunker Reborn|last1=Basciano|first1=Oliver|website=ARTINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While some rooms were transformed into classic white cube spaces, others still bare traces of the bunker’s lineage when it was used as a prison, storage facility and techno club&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/28iht-bunker28.html|title=Contemporary Art Finds a Shelter in Berlin|last=Eddy|first=Melissa|date=2012-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each exhibition in the bunker additionally includes site-specific works that refer to and interact with the various interior spaces and their history.

The collection is accessible to the public from Thursdays through Sundays only in the form of guided tours via prior application on the website of the collection.

The current collection, “Boros Collection / Bunker Berlin #3” opened in May 2017 and presents recently acquired works as well as pieces from the 1990s and 2000s.

"'''Clever Hans'''" (German "Der gescheite Hans") is a fairy tale collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] about a boy who ruins his engagement with a girl through a variety of comedic events. The title is claimed by most people to be ironic.

==Plot summary==

A boy named Hans has a conversation with his mother every morning (in the morning conversations he simply is telling her he is going to meet his fiancee Gretel) and evening (in which his mother reprimands him for mishandling a gift from his fiancee). Every morning when Hans meets Gretel he asks her for a gift. In order, she gives him:

*a [[Sewing needle|needle]]
*a [[knife]]
*a young [[goat]]
*a [[ham]]
*a [[calf]]
*herself

In each instance, Hans mishandles the gifts. He sticks the needle in some hay but his mother tells him he should have stuck it through his sleeve. So he puts the knife in his sleeve but is told he should have put it in his pocket. He puts the goat in his pocket, thus smothering it, and is told he should have led it by a rope. He tries to lead the ham by a rope, and dogs steal it, his mother telling him he should have carried it on his head (or, in some versions, under his arm). He carries the calf this way but it kicks him until he drops it and it runs away. He is told he should have tied it in the stable. He ties Gretel in the stable and the story ends when he misunderstands his mother's advice ("Cast your adoring eyes at her") and gouges out the eyes of the livestock he owns to throw at Gretel.

The result is a disengagement, portrayed in the final sentence: "And that's how Hans lost his bride."

'''''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater''''' ([[1821 in literature|1821]]) is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account written by [[Thomas De Quincey]], about his [[laudanum]]  [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and its effect on his life. The ''Confessions'' was "the first major work De Quincey&lt;!--"De Quincey" is always capitalized--&gt; published and the one which won him fame almost overnight..."&lt;ref&gt;Judson S. Lyon, ''Thomas de Quincey'', New York, Twayne, 1969; p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published anonymously in September and October 1821 in the ''[[London Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''London Magazine'', Vol. IV, No. xxi, pp. 293–312, and No. xxii, pp. 353–79.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Confessions'' was released in book form in 1822, and again in 1856, in an edition revised by &lt;!--De is always capitalized in his case--&gt;De Quincey.

==Synopsis==
As originally published,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater'', edited by Alethea Hayter, New York, Penguin Books, 1971, provides the original magazine text.&lt;/ref&gt; De Quincey's account was organized into two parts:&lt;ref&gt;About the structure of the novel based on paradigms, see (in French)  [[:fr:Yann Tholoniat|Yann Tholoniat]], « Thomas de Quincey et le paradigme perdu ». In ''Lectures d'une œuvre'': Confessions of an English Opium-Eater – Thomas de Quincey. Paris, Éditions du Temps, 2003 : 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I begins with a notice "To the Reader", to establish the narrative frame: "I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life...." It is followed by the substance of Part I,
** ''Preliminary Confessions'', devoted to the author's childhood and youth, and concentrated upon the emotional and psychological factors that underlay the later opium experiences — especially the period in his late teens that De Quincey spent as a homeless runaway in Oxford Street in London in 1802 and 1803.
* Part II is split into several sections:
** A relatively brief introduction and connecting passage, followed by
** ''The Pleasures of Opium'', which discusses the early and largely positive phase of the author's experience with the drug, from 1804 until 1812;
** ''Introduction to the Pains of Opium'', which delivers a second installment of autobiography, taking De Quincey from youth to maturity; and
** ''The Pains of Opium'', which recounts the extreme of the author's opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares, frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms.
* Another "Notice to the Reader" attempts to clarify the chronology of the whole.

[[File:Cover of Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an Opium Eater.JPG|thumb|The cover of Thomas De Quincey's book ''Confessions of an Opium-Eater''. This version was published by the Mershon Company in 1898.]]

Though De Quincey was later criticized for giving too much attention to the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of addiction, ''The Pains of Opium'' is in fact significantly longer than ''The Pleasures''. However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the opium experience:

::"The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &amp;c. were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive. Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100 years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience."&lt;ref&gt;See Alethea Hayter's Penguin edition, pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
From its first appearance, the literary style of the ''Confessions'' attracted attention and comment. De Quincey was well-read in the English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and assimilated influences and models from Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and other writers. Arguably the most famous and often-quoted passage in the ''Confessions'' is the [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] to opium in the final paragraph of ''The Pleasures'':

::"Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for 'the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,' bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed pure of blood...."

De Quincey modelled this passage on the apostrophe "O eloquent, just and mightie Death!" in Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''History of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, pp. 83, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in ''The Pleasures of Opium'', De Quincey describes the long walks he took through the London streets under the drug's influence:

::"Some of these rambles led me to great distances; for an opium-eater is too happy to observe the motions of time. And sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating all the capes and headlands I had doubled in my outward voyage, I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such enigmatical entries, and such sphinx's riddles of streets without thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of porters, and confound the intellects of hackney-coachmen."&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Confessions'' represents De Quincey's initial effort to write what he called "impassioned prose", an effort that he would later resume in ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845) and ''[[The English Mail-Coach]]'' (1849).

==The 1856 revision==
In the early 1850s, De Quincey prepared the first collected edition of his works for publisher James Hogg. For that edition, he undertook a large-scale revision of the ''Confessions'', more than doubling the work's length. Most notably, he expanded the opening section on his personal background, until it consumed more than two-thirds of the whole. Yet he gave the book "a much weaker beginning" and detracted from the impact of the original with digressions and inconsistencies; "the verdict of most critics is that the earlier version is artistically superior".&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

"De Quincey undoubtedly spoiled his masterpiece by revising it... anyone who compares the two will prefer the unflagging vigour and tension of the original version to the tired prosiness of much of the revised one".&lt;ref&gt;Alethea Hayter's Introduction to the Penguin edition, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Confessions'' maintained a place of primacy in De Quincey's literary output, and his literary reputation, from its first publication; "it went through countless editions, with only occasional intervals of a few years, and was often translated. Since there was little systematic study of narcotics until long after his death, De Quincey's account assumed an authoritative status and actually dominated the scientific and public views of the effects of opium for several generations."&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, ''Advice to Opium Eaters'', was published "to warn others from copying De Quincey."&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Berridge and [[Griffith Edwards]], ''Opium and the People: Opiate Use in Nineteenth-Century England'', New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987; p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — [[Francis Thompson]], [[James Thomson (B.V.)|James Thomson]], William Blair, and perhaps [[Branwell Brontë]] — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge and Edwards, p. 53; Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 1860 translation and adaptation, ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, ''[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]'' (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the ''Confessions''. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, pp. 93–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' influenced [[psychology]] and [[abnormal psychology]], and attitudes towards dreams and imaginative literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alethea Hayter]], ''Opium and the Romantic Imagination: Addiction and Creativity in de Quincey, Coleridge, Baudelaire and Others'', revised edition, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, Crucible, 1988; pp. 101–31 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Bolshevism''' (German: ''Kulturbolschewismus''), sometimes referred to specifically as "'''art Bolshevism'''" or "'''music Bolshevism'''",&lt;ref&gt;Spotts, Frederic. ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press (2002). pp.18;24. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a term widely used by critics in [[Nazi Germany]] to denounce [[modernism|modernist]] movements in the arts, particularly when seeking to discredit more [[nihilism|nihilistic]] forms of expression. This first became an issue during the 1920s in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. German artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Max Beckmann]] were denounced by [[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Nazi Party]] and other [[right-wing]] [[nationalism|nationalists]] as "cultural Bolsheviks".

== History ==
The development of [[modern art]] at the beginning of the 20th century &amp;ndash; but with roots going back to the 1860s &amp;ndash; denoted a revolutionary divergence from traditional artistic values to ones based on the personal perceptions and feelings of the artists.  This rejection of traditional authority &amp;ndash; intimately linked to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advance of [[democracy]] as the preferred form of government &amp;ndash; was exhilarating to some, but extremely threatening to others, as it took away the security they felt under the old order, and the very cohesiveness of [[Western culture]] and civilization appeared to be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, H.W. and Janson, Anthony F. ''History of Art'' New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1991. p.615 {{ISBN|0-8109-3401-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernist break occurred at around the same time as the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, and it was perhaps natural that those who felt threatened by the new artistic viewpoint would associate it with the group that came out on top after that revolution, the [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]] with their [[Marxist–Leninist]] political philosophy. In reality, the connection between the modernism and Bolshevism was extremely tenuous, and primarily a matter of both existing at the same unsettled time in European history.  Still, some artists in [[Western Europe]] drew inspiration from revolutionary ideals, to the extent that [[Dada]]ist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] confidently declared in 1920 that Dada was a "German Bolshevist affair."&lt;ref name="CanningBarndt2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Canning|editor-first1=Kathleen|editor-last2=Barndt|editor-first2=Kerstin|editor-last3=McGuire|editor-first3=Kristin|last=Doherty|first=Brigid|title=Weimar Publics/weimar Subjects: Rethinking the Political Culture of Germany in the 1920s|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXP9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|year=2013|location=New York|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-108-2|page=53|chapter=The Work of Art and the Problem of Politics in Berlin Dada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of new art with Bolshevism circulated in right-wing and nationalist discourse in the following years; it was, for example, the subject of a chapter in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Amid [[Hitler's rise to power]] the Nazis denounced a number of contemporary styles as "cultural Bolshevism," notably [[abstract art]] and [[Bauhaus]] architecture. After seeing a colleague beaten by Nazi supporters for comments sympathetic to modern art, typographer [[Paul Renner]] published an essay against Nazi aesthetics titled "Kulturbolschewismus?" Around the same time, [[Carl von Ossietzky]] mocked the flexibility of the term in Nazi writings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cultural Bolshevism is when conductor [[Otto Klemperer|[Otto] Klemperer]] takes tempi different from his colleague [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|[Wilhelm] Furtwängler]]; when a painter sweeps a color into his sunset not seen in [[Lower Pomerania]]; when one favors birth control; when one builds a house with a flat roof; when a Caesarean birth is shown on the screen; when one admires the performance of [[Charlie Chaplin|[Charlie] Chaplin]] and the mathematical wizardry of [[Albert Einstein|[Albert] Einstein]]. This is called cultural Bolshevism and a personal favor rendered to Herr [[Stalin]]. It is also the democratic mentality of the brothers [[Heinrich Mann|[Heinrich and Thomas]]] [[Thomas Mann|Mann]], a piece of music by [[Paul Hindemith|[Paul] Hindemith]] or [[Kurt Weill|[Kurt] Weill]], and is to be identified with the hysterical insistence of a madman for a law giving him permission to marry his own grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl von Ossietzky|von Ossietzky, Carl]] in ''Weltbühne'' ("World Stage") (21 April 1931) quoted in Deák, István [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g6cJNfRN0cC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Cultural+Bolshevism+is+when+conductor+Klemperer+takes+tempi+different+from+his+colleague+Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EUnQY_axmJ&amp;sig=a63Fc6kqIdA_lfY0E39ghkUDiZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI4c3nub6VxwIVA6QeCh2NtgtU#v=onepage&amp;q=Cultural%20Bolshevism%20is%20when%20conductor%20Klemperer%20takes%20tempi%20different%20from%20his%20colleague%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;f=false ''Weimar Germany's Left-wing Intellectuals: A Political History of the Weltbühne and Its Circle'']. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1968. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes.&lt;ref name="MichaudLloyd2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaud|first1=Eric|last2=Lloyd|first2=Janet|title=The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4327-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Weimar Germany|Weimar-era]] art personalities, including Renner, Huelsenbeck, and the Bauhaus designers, were marginalized.

[[File:Henryk Siemiradzki 004.jpeg|thumb|300px|''An orgy in Imperial Rome'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]]]
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[theoretical physics]], '''explicit symmetry breaking''' is the breaking of a [[symmetry]] of a [[theory]] by terms in its defining [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (most typically, to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) that do not respect the symmetry. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the [[Zeeman effect]], due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.

Explicit symmetry breaking differs from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the [[ground state]] ([[vacuum state|vacuum]]) of the theory breaks it.&lt;ref&gt;Castellani, E. (2003) "On the meaning of Symmetry Breaking" in Brading, K. and Castellani, E. (eds)  Symmetries in Physics: New Reflections, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha &amp; Amaratunga (2016) "Explicit Symmetry Breaking in Electrodynamic Systems and Electromagnetic Radiation" Morgan Claypool, Institute of Physics, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass mural, Belfast.jpg|thumb|Mural featuring Frederick Douglass in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].]]
'''''Frederick Douglass and the White Negro''''' is a documentary telling the story of ex-slave, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], writer and politician [[Frederick Douglass]] and his escape to Ireland from America in the 1840s.

==Synopsis==
The film follows Douglass' life from slavery as a young man through to his time in [[Ireland]] where he befriended [[Daniel O'Connell]], toured the country spreading the message of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] and was treated as a human being for the first time by white people. His arrival in Ireland coincided with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and he witnessed white people in what he considered to be a worse state than his fellow [[African Americans]] back in the US. The film follows Douglass back to [[United States|America]] where he buys his freedom with funds raised in Ireland and Britain. Fellow passengers on his return journey include the Irish escaping the famine who arrive in their millions and would go on to play a major role in the [[New York Draft Riot]] of 1863 which Douglass could only despair over. The film examines (with contributions from the author of ''How The Irish Became White'' [[Noel Ignatiev]] amongst others) the turbulent relationship between [[African Americans]] and [[Irish Americans]] during the [[American Civil War]], what drew them together and what drove them apart and how this would shape the America of the twentieth century and beyond.

The '''Jack Benny Center for the Arts''', located in Bowen Park, [[Waukegan, Illinois]], is the Cultural Arts Division of the [http://www.waukeganparks.org Waukegan Park District]. The Center plays host to the Bowen Park Theatre and Opera Company (a professional theatre/opera company), the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra and Concert Chorus (community based performance groups), as well as numerous theatre, dance, and /visual art classes and private music and voice lessons.  The center started out as a not-for-profit corporation in 1964.  Upon the death of [[Jack Benny]] in 1974, the name was changed.  The music and fine arts school became part of the Waukegan Park District in 1982 as a division of the recreation department.

==History==
The Waukegan Park District completed a new home for the center and its departments in Bowen Park in 1987 and had become its own division of the park district. Originally the Center had been in Bowen Park, moved to Powell Park for a time, and was delighted to return to Bowen Park. With the addition of Goodfellow Hall, an eighty-nine-seat lecture-recital hall, the division founded Bowen Park Theatre and Bowen Park Opera in the mid 1980s. These two companies went from semi-professional to fully professional, non-Equity, non-union in three years.

Waukegan Symphony Orchestra was born on April 24, 1974, when favorite comedic son Jack Benny returned to his home town of Waukegan to star in the WSO's initial performance. It was a magical night, held at Waukegan High School's auditorium. Like the Music Center of Lake County, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has made itself synonymous with the broad range of culture that is the hallmark of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Through its thirty-five-plus-year history, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has engaged its audiences in both traditional and challenging works.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Musical direction now rests in the  hands of Maestro Stephen Blackwelder.

Waukegan Concert Chorus was established as a community chorus in 1976 to sing with the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Verdi's ''Requiem''. Both the members of the community{{Who|date=April 2011}} recognized the great benefit of retaining such a cultural asset in the community and the Chorus continued as an independent sister organization to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra.

Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Theatre Company in the spring of 1987 at approximately the same time as Bowen Park Opera. The company's objective was to produce mostly classical drama and comedies, avoiding musicals and the repertory of neighboring theatre groups. Within three years, Bowen Park Theatre became a fully professional, non-equity theatre, joining the professional ranks of only two other companies in Lake County. Currently, the Ensemble Players (college age), the Roundtree Players (14–18 years of age) and Stage One (8–13 years of age) give the youth to young adults of the community an opportunity to develop and study the art of acting, also use the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall.

Bowen Park Opera Company has its roots to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra performances in the mid-1980s.  In 1987, the new Jack Benny Center for the Arts facility was completed in Bowen Park.  Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Opera Company to perform in Goodfellow Hall. Its first production was a double bill in the spring of 1987 of Holst's ''The Wandering Scholar'' and Mozart's ''The Impresario''.   In 2003, Goodfellow Hall was renamed the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall to honor the man who had led the Cultural Arts to where it is today.  Dr.  Schornick retired from the Waukegan Park District in 2004.

In 1994, the Cultural Arts Division became responsible for the programs of the Waukegan Park District's Historic Districts. The operation and restoration of the Haines Museum in Bowen Park was only a part of that. Programs were developed and the newest of the Cultural Arts' departments, Bowen Heritage Circle, was born. The Bowen Heritage Circle specializes in traditional and special interest crafts and lectures.  The [[Waukegan Historical Society]] rents the Haines House and library space at Lilac Cottage.  The society maintains the collections and the park district provides the organization with a museum supervisor.

Goodfellow Hall was a part of the [[Jane Addams|Jane Addams']] [[Hull House]] Settlement House's Bowen Country Club.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">'''Jann''' ({{lang-ar|جَنّ / جُنّ}}, ''jann'') is a type of [[Jinn]] in  [[Arabic|Arabian]]- and [[Islam]]-related lore which has several meanings:
* Designation for the Jinn-genus, to distinguish them from the term "Jinn" as a collective noun for all [[supernatural creature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* The father of all Jinn created from the fires of ''[[Samum (Islam)|samum]]'', sometimes identified with [[Iblis]] or [[Azazel#In Islam|Azazel]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Society ''Studia Orientalia, Band 85'' 1999 University of Michigan digitized 2008 page 130&lt;/ref&gt;
* A primitive type of Jinn, which dwelled on earth before the actual Jinn emerged or a transformed type of Jinn, comparable how [[Dead Sea Apes|Apes]] are related to humans. These Jann are regarded as the most harmless class of supernatural creatures.&lt;ref name="PH"&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jann'' from the [[Semitic root]] {{sc|jnn}} is an [[Arabic]] term, whose primary meaning is "to hide" and can also refer to an agile snake.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman ''The Meaning and Explanation of the Glorious Qur'an (Vol 7)'' MSA Publication Limited 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-861-79661-5}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Quran]] this term appears in Surah 15:27 and Surah 27:10 to designate a [[supernatural|supernatural creature]] or a serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Saïd Muhammad Badawi, M.

Hewitt began her career as a child actress and singer, appearing in national television commercials before joining the cast of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' (1989–1991) as well as performing as a backup singer before recording her debut studio album at the age of 12, ''[[Love Songs (Jennifer Love Hewitt album)|Love Songs]]'' (1992), which was released exclusively in [[Japan]]. Hewitt received her breakthrough role as Sarah Reeves Merrin on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] teen drama ''[[Party of Five]]'' (1995–1999), and rose to fame as a teen star for her role as Julie James in the horror film ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) and its [[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer|1998 sequel]].

Hewitt released her second and third studio albums with [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Let's Go Bang]]'' (1995) and ''[[Jennifer Love Hewitt (album)|Jennifer Love Hewitt]]'' (1996), both of which saw little commercial success. Thereafter, she starred alongside [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the romantic comedy film ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'' (2001) and alongside [[Jackie Chan]] in the action comedy film ''[[The Tuxedo]]'' (2002). Hewitt released her fourth studio album and most recent to date with [[Jive Records]] in 2002, ''[[BareNaked]]'', which became her first album to chart in the United States, peaking at number 37 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Her most successful single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] was the 1999 release "[[How Do I Deal]]", which peaked at number 59.&lt;ref&gt;[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r382817|pure_url=yes}} "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"].

She later starred on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] drama series ''[[The Client List (TV series)|The Client List]]'' from 2012 to 2013, and was previously nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the [[The Client List|pilot film]]. From 2014 to 2015, she starred as Special Agent Kate Callahan on the CBS crime drama ''[[Criminal Minds]]''. In addition to acting, she has served as a producer on some of her film and television projects. Hewitt was identified as the "number one reader choice" on the November 1999 and May 2009 covers of ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/amg/girls/girls-of-maxim/44035/maxim-covers.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917220036/http://www.maxim.com/amg/girls/girls-of-maxim/44035/maxim-covers.html |date=September 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' named her the sexiest woman on television in 2008.&lt;ref name=tvguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tvs-sexiest-stars/293083|title=TV's Sexiest Stars|work=TV Guide|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Thomas was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. She got her first toy piano at the age of 3, and began formal lessons on both the piano and violin at the age of 5, under the tutelage of her mother, Carolyn Southworth.&lt;ref name="jenniferthomasmusic.wordpress.com"/&gt; Her brothers also learned piano, violin, and cello from their mother. Jennifer and her older brother played in grade school orchestras, with Southworth as a conductor's assistant. Thomas continued to train classically, and was involved in many recitals and piano adjudications through her teen years. She played with various youth orchestras and high school orchestras. She performed at her high school graduation, and later went to [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]].&lt;ref name="jenniferthomasmusic.wordpress.com"/&gt;

At [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]], Thomas studied piano under Professor Stephen Allen. She was a member of the university's Piano Ensemble group, accompanied the College choir and many vocal/instrumental students, as well as played violin in the university symphony. Thomas also competed in the University's Concerto Competition, where she took 2nd place performing the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Prokofiev)]].&lt;ref name="jenniferthomasmusic.wordpress.com"/&gt;

After college graduation, Thomas moved to [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and was a regular performer with the [[Temple Square]] Concert Series, and played violin in the [[Murray, Utah]] Symphony Orchestra. While performing with the Murray Symphony, Thomas was a featured soloist on the [[Edward MacDowell]] Piano Concerto No.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiemusicchannel.com/photo/macdowell-concerto-murray-symphony-2002 |title=MacDowell Concerto - Murray Symphony 2002 |publisher=Indie Music Channel |date=2012-05-01 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She eventually moved to Northwest, where she performed as a violinist with the Oregon Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra, and worked for the [[Seattle Symphony]] in the Education Department. It was during her time working for the [[Seattle Symphony]] when she started composing her own original music.

==Personal life==
Thomas is married to Will Thomas, an ultra-marathon competitor who, in 2015, competed in the 106 mile race [[Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc]] in France. Together, they have three children and reside in the [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] area.&lt;ref name="jenniferthomasmusic.wordpress.com"/&gt;

'''Jousting''' is a martial game or ''[[hastilude]]'' between two horsemen wielding [[lance]]s with blunted tips, often as part of a [[tournament (medieval)|tournament]]. The primary aim was to replicate a clash of [[heavy cavalry]], with each participant trying hard to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or [[jousting armour]], or unhorsing him. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the [[knight (stock character)|knight]] in Romantic [[medievalism]]. The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the lances collide with their armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=May The G Force Be With You |url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/80107437?trackId=14272744 |access-date=10 December 2016 |series=White Rabbit Project |first1=Kari |last1=Byron |author1-link=Kari Byron |first2=Grant |last2=Imahara |author2-link=Grant Imahara |first3=Tory |last3=Belleci |author3-link=Tory Belleci |network=[[Netflix]] |date=9 December 2016 |season=1 |number=6 |minutes=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|joster}}, ultimately from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|iuxtare}} "to approach, to meet". The word was loaned into [[Middle English]] around 1300, when jousting was a very popular sport among the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] knighthood. The synonym '''tilt''' dates {{circa|1510}}.

Jousting is based on the military use of the lance by heavy cavalry. It transformed into a specialised sport during the [[Late Middle Ages]], and remained popular with the [[nobility]] in [[Tudor period|England and Wales]] and [[16th-century Germany|Germany]] throughout the whole of the 16th century (while in France, it was discontinued after the death of [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] in an accident in 1559).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barber |first1=Richard |first2=Juliet |last2=Barker |title=Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages |publisher=Boydell |date=1 January 1989 |pages=134, 139 |isbn=978-0-85115-470-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, jousting was the highlight of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and of [[James VI and I]], and also was part of the festivities at the marriage of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].{{Sfn|Young|1977|pp=201–8}}

Jousting was discontinued in favour of other [[equestrian sports]] in the 17th century, although non-contact forms of "[[tent pegging|equestrian skill-at-arms]]" disciplines survived. There has been a limited revival of [[theatrical jousting]] re-enactment since the 1970s.

==Medieval joust==
[[Image:Codex Manesse 081 Walther von Klingen.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of a late 13th-century joust in the [[Codex Manesse]]. Joust by Walther von Klingen.]]
The medieval joust has its origins in the military tactics of [[heavy cavalry]] during the [[High Middle Ages]]. By the 14th century, many members of the nobility, including kings had taken up jousting to showcase their own courage, skill and talents, and the sport proved just as dangerous for a king as a knight, and from the 15th century on, jousting became a sport (''[[hastilude]]'') without direct relevance to warfare.

===High Middle Ages===
From the 11th to 14th centuries when medieval jousting was still practised in connection to the use of the lance in warfare, armour evolved from [[mail (armour)|mail]] (with a solid, heavy helmet, called a "[[great helm]]", and shield) to plate armour. By 1400, knights wore full suits of [[plate armour]], called a "harness"  (Clephan 28-29).

In this early period, a ''joust'' was still a (martial) "meeting", i.e. a [[duel]] in general and not limited to the lance.
Combatants would begin riding on one another with the lance, but might continue with shorter range weapons after the distance was closed or after one or both parties had been unhorsed.
Tournaments in the High Medieval period were much rougher and less "gentlemanly" affairs than in the late medieval era of [[chivalry]]. The rival parties would fight in groups, with the aim of incapacitating their adversaries for the sake of gaining their horses, arms and ransoms.&lt;ref&gt;L.F. Salzman, "English Life in the Middle Ages," Oxford, 1950.
"These early tournaments were very rough affairs and in every sense, quite unlike the chivalrous contests of later days; the rival parties fought in groups, and it was considered not only fair but commendable to hold off until you saw some of your adversaries getting tired and then to join in the attack on them; the object was not to break a lance in the most approved style, but frankly to disable as many opponents as possible for the sake of obtaining their spears, arms, and ransoms."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Sigstap rienolt tjost.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a standing joust in an Alsatian manuscript of ca. 1420 ([[CPG 359]]); protection for the legs of the riders is integrated into the horse armour.]]
With the development of the courtly ideals of [[chivalry]] in the late medieval period, the joust became more regulated.
This tendency is also reflected in the [[pas d'armes]] in general. It was now considered dishonourable to exploit an opponent's disadvantage, and knights would pay close attention to avoid being in a position of advantage, seeking to gain honour by fighting against the odds.
This romanticised "chivalric revival" was based on the [[chivalric romance]]s of the high medieval period, which noblemen tried to "reenact" in real life, sometimes blurring the lines of reality and fiction.

The development of the term ''[[knight]]'' (''chevalier'') dates to this period. Before the 12th century, ''cniht'' was a term for a servant. In the 12th century, it became used of a military follower in particular.  Also in the 12th century, a special class of noblemen serving in cavalry developed, known as ''milites nobiles''.  By the end of the 13th century, ''chivalry'' (''chyualerye'') was used not just in the technical sense of "cavalry" but for martial virtue in general.  It was only after 1300 that ''knighthood'' (''kniȝthod'', originally a term for "boyhood, youth") came to be used as a junior rank of nobility. By the later 14th century, the term became romanticised for the ideal of the young nobleman seeking to prove himself in honourable exploits, the [[knight-errant]], which among other things encompassed the [[pas d'armes]], including the joust.  By the 15th century, "knightly" virtues were sought by the noble classes even of ranks much senior than "knight".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "knight", "knighthood", "chivalry".&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic association of the [[knight (stock character)|"knight" stock-character]] with the joust is thus historical, but develops only at the end of the Middle Ages.

The ''lists'', or ''list field'', was the arena where a jousting event was held. More precisely, it was the roped-off enclosure where tournament fighting took place.&lt;ref name="Hopkins2004"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0INlcK2NlgC&amp;pg=PT36 | title=Tournaments and Jousts: Training for War in Medieval Times | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | last=Hopkins | first=Andrea | year=2004 | page=36 | isbn=978-0-8239-3994-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late medieval period, castles and palaces were augmented by purpose-built ''[[tiltyard]]s'' as a venue for "jousting tournaments". Training for such activities included the use of special equipment, of which the best-known was the [[Quintain (jousting)|quintain]].

The  ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles of Froissart]]'', written during the 1390s, and covering the period of 1327 to 1400, contain many details concerning jousting in this era.  The combat was now expected to be non-lethal, and it was not necessary to incapacitate the opponent, who was expected to honourably yield to the dominant fighter.  The combat was divided into rounds of three encounters with various weapons, of which the joust proper was one.  During this time, the joust detached itself from the reality on the battlefield and became a chivalric sport.  Knights would seek opportunities to duel opponents from the hostile camp for honour off the battlefield.

As an example, Froissart&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |last = Froissart | first = John | title = Chronicles of England, France, Spain and the adjoining countries from the latter part of the reign of Edward II to the coronation of Henry IV in 12 volumes | edition = 1803–10 | url = http://www.medievalist.globalfolio.net/eng/f/ | volume = 1 | pages = 613–15 | publisher = Global folio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nipissingu.ca/department/history/muhlberger/froissart/gauvain.htm | title = Gauvain | publisher = Nipissingu | place = CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; records that, during a campaign in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] in the year 1380, a squire of the garrison of [[Toury]] castle named Gauvain Micaille (Michaille)—also mentioned in the ''Chronique du bon duc Loys de Bourbon'' as wounded in 1382 at [[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke]], and again in 1386; in 1399 was in the service of the duke of Bourbon&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Siméon | last = Luce | title = Chroniques | year = 1869 | url = https://archive.org/stream/chroniques09froi#page/n118/mode/1up | page = cvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Coltman | 1919 | p = 29}}—yelled out to the English,
{{quote |Is there among you any gentleman who for the love of his lady is willing to try with me some feat of arms?  If there should be any such, here I am, quite ready to sally forth completely armed and mounted, to tilt three courses with the lance, to give three blows with the battle axe, and three strokes with the dagger.  Now look, you English, if there be none among you in love.}}

The challenge was answered by a squire named Joachim Cator, who said  "I will deliver him from his vow: let him make haste and come out of the castle."

Micaille came to meet his opponent with attendants carrying three lances, three battle-axes, three swords and three daggers.  The duel began with a joust, described as follows:
{{quote |When they had taken their stations, they gave to each of them a spear, and the tilt began; but neither of them struck the other, from the mettlesomeness of their horses.  They hit the second onset, but it was by darting their spears.&lt;ref&gt;Johnes, Thomas. ''Sir John Froissart's Chronicles of England'', 208&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The meeting was then adjourned, and continued on the next day.

{{quote |They met each other roughly with spears, and the French squire tilted much to the satisfaction of the earl: but the Englishman kept his spear too low, and at last struck it into the thigh of the Frenchman.  The earl of Buckingham as well as the other lords were much enraged by this, and said it was tilting dishonorably; but he excused himself, by declaring it as solely owing to the restiveness of his horse.&lt;ref&gt;https://faculty.nipissingu.ca/muhlberger/FROISSART/GAUVAIN.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In spite of the French squire's injury, the duel was continued with three thrusts with the sword. After this, the encounter was stopped because of the Micaille's loss of blood. He was given leave to rejoin his garrison with a reward of a hundred francs by the earl of Buckingham, who stated that he had acquitted himself much to his satisfaction.

Froissart describes a tournament at Cambray in 1385, held on the marriage of the Count d'Ostrevant to the daughter of Duke Philip of Burgundy.  The tournament was held in the market-place of the town, and forty knights took part.  The king jousted with a knight of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], Sir John Destrenne, for the prize of a clasp of precious stones, taken off from the bosom of the Duchess of Burgundy; it was won by Sir Destrenne, and formally presented by the [[Admiral of France]] and Sir Guy de la Trimouille.

A knightly duel in this period usually consisted in three courses of jousting, and three blows and strokes exchanged with battle-axes, swords, and daggers.  This number tended to be extended towards the end of the century, until the most common number was five, as in the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden and Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387 (''cinq lances a cheval, cinq coups d'épée, cinq coups de dague et cinq coups de hache''). Later could be as high as ten or even twelve.  In the 1387 encounter, the first four courses of the joust were run without decisive outcome, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lost consciousness. He was revived, however, and all the strokes and blows could be duly exchanged, without any further injury.

On another instance, a meeting with sharp lances was arranged to take place near [[Nantes]], under the auspices of the [[Grand Constable of France|Constable of France]] and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of [[Poitou]] advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties was hurt.

Another encounter took place between John de Chatelmorant and Jannequin Clinton, in which the Englishman was unhorsed. Finally Chatelmorant fought with Sir William Farrington, the former receiving a dangerous wound in the thigh, for which the Englishman was greatly blamed, as being an infraction of the rules of the tourney, but an accident was pleaded just as in the case of the 1380 duel between Gauvain Micaille and Joachim Cator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Coltman | 1919 | p = 30}} summarizing {{Citation |title = Froissart's Chronicles | chapter = 5 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance-era joust==
{{further|Plate armour}}
The medieval joust took place on an open field. Indeed, the term ''joust'' meant "a meeting" and referred to arranged combat in general, not just the jousting with lances. At some point in the 14th century, a cloth barrier was introduced as an option to separate the contestants. This barrier was presumably known as ''tilt'' in Middle English (a term with an original meaning of "a cloth covering"). It became a wooden barrier or fence in the 15th century, now known as "tilt barrier", and "tilt" came to be used as a term for the joust itself by {{circa|1510}}.  The purpose of the tilt barrier was to prevent collisions and to keep the combatants at an optimal angle for breaking the lance.  This greatly facilitated the control of the horse and allowed the rider to concentrate on aiming the lance.  The introduction of the barrier seems to have originated in the south, as it only became a standard feature of jousting in Germany in the 16th century, and was there called the Italian or "{{lang|gmh|[[walhaz|welsch]]}}" mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Braden K. |last=Frieder |title=Chivalry &amp; The Perfect Prince: Tournaments, Art, and Armor at the Spanish Habsburg Court |publisher= Truman State University Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-931112-69-7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NFtMbrAHZpsC&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated [[tilt-yards]] with such barriers were built in England from the time of [[Henry VIII]].

[[File:KHM Wien S XVI - Jousting armour of John the Constant, c. 1497-1505, front.jpg|thumb|The ''{{lang|de|Stechzeug}}'' of [[John the Constant]] ({{circa|1500}})]]
Specialised jousting armour was produced in the late 15th to 16th century. It was heavier than suits of [[plate armour]] intended for combat, and could weigh as much as 50&amp;nbsp;kg (110&amp;nbsp;lb), compared to some 25&amp;nbsp;kg (55&amp;nbsp;lb) for field armour; as it did not need to permit free movement of the wearer, the only limiting factor was the maximum weight that could be carried by a [[warhorse]] of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Edge |first2=John Miles |last2=Paddock |title=Arms &amp; armor of the medieval knight |publisher= Crescent Books|year= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-517-64468-3|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1490s, emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] invested a lot of effort into perfecting the sport, for which he received his nickname of "The Last Knight". ''{{lang|de|Rennen}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Stechen}}'' were two sportive forms of the joust developed during the 15th century and practised throughout the 16th century. The armours used for these two respective styles of the joust was known as ''{{lang|de|Rennzeug}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Stechzeug}}'', respectively.The ''{{lang|de|Stechzeug}}'' in particular developed into extremely heavy armour which completely inhibited the movement of the rider, in its latest forms resembling an armour-shaped cabin integrated into the [[horse armour]] more than a functional suit of armour. Such forms of sportive equipment during the final phase of the joust in [[16th-century Germany]] gave rise to modern misconceptions about the heaviness or clumsiness of "medieval armour", as notably popularised by [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=John |title=Cavalry: The History of Mounted Warfare |publisher=[[Putnam, Connecticut|Putnam]] |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woosnam-Savage |first=Robert C |author2=Anthony Hall |title=Brassey's Book of Body Armor |publisher=Potomac Books |year=2002 |isbn=1-57488-465-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely heavy helmets of the ''{{lang|de|Stechzeug}}'' are explained by the fact that the aim was to detach the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the opponent's helmet, resulting in frequent full impact of the lance to the helmet.

By contrast the ''{{lang|de|Rennen}}'' was a type of joust with lighter contact. Here, the aim was to hit the opponent's shield.  The specialised ''{{lang|de|Rennzeug}}'' was developed on the request of Maximilian, who desired a return to a more agile form of joust compared to the heavily armoured "full contact" ''{{lang|de|Stechen}}''. In the ''{{lang|de|Rennzeug}}'', the shield was attached to the armour with a mechanism of springs and would detach itself upon contact.

In France, the 1559 death of King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] of wounds suffered in a tournament led to the end of jousting as a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Graham |last=Martin |title=The death of Henry II of France: A sporting death and post-mortem. |journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=318–20 |date=May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tilt continued through Henry VIII and onto the reign of Elizabeth I. Under her rule, tournaments were seen as more of a parade or show than an actual martial exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schulze |first=Ivan L. |year=1933 |title=Notes on Elizabethan Chivalry and "The Faerie Queene" |jstor=4172200 |journal=Studies in Philology |volume=30 |pages=148–159  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Elizabethan [[Accession Day tilt]] was held in November 1602; Elizabeth died the following spring.  Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of [[James I of England|James I]], 24 March, until 1624, the year before his death.{{Sfn|Strong|1977|pp=137–38}}{{Sfn|Young|1987|p=208}}  In the early 17th century, the joust was replaced as the equine highlight of court festivities by large "horse-ballet" displays called [[carousel]]s, although non-combat competitions such as the ring-tilt lasted until the 18th century.

One attempt to revive the joust was the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]].

==Horses==
{{further|Horses in the Middle Ages|Horses in warfare}}
The two most common kinds of horse used for jousting were [[warmblood]] ''[[Horses in the Middle Ages|charger]]s'' and larger ''[[destrier]]s''. Chargers were medium-weight horses bred and trained for agility and stamina.  Destriers were heavier, similar to today's [[Andalusian horse]], but not as large as the modern [[draft horse]].

During a jousting tournament, the horses were cared for by their [[groom (horses)|groom]]s in their respective tents. They wore [[caparison]]s, a type of ornamental cloth featuring the owner's [[heraldry|heraldic signs]]. Competing horses had their heads protected by a [[chanfron]], an iron shield for protection from otherwise lethal lance hits (Clayton 22-56).

Other forms of equipment on the horse included long-necked [[spur]]s which enabled the rider to control the horse with extended legs, a [[saddle]] with a high back to provide leverage during the charge or when hit, as well as [[stirrup]]s for the necessary leverage to deliver blows with the lance (Tkačenko).

===Modern day jousting===

{{main|Theatrical jousting}}

[[Jousting reenactment|Jousting re-enactors]] have been active since the 1970s. A jousting show took place in 1972 at the Principality of Gwrych in [[North Wales]] near [[Abergele]]. The Company of Knights Limited, founded in early 1974, organised jousting shows including from five to as many as fifty actors.

Between 1980 and 1982 the Little England theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]] was planned as a jousting stadium. Although the first phase of the project was constructed, high interest rates cancelled the project.  The medieval dinner re-enactment company [[Medieval Times]] includes the sport in its dinner show. Jousting shows are also offered seasonally at [[Warwick Castle]] and [[Hever Castle]] in the United Kingdom. And groups like the Knights of Royal England travel around Britain and Europe staging medieval Jousting Tournaments; at the Danish museum [[Middelaldercentret]] there are daily tournaments during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/Pressresources/NewsAndMediaPressresourcesTOLTournamentattheTower |title=Historic Royal Palaces &gt; Home &gt; Hidden &gt; Press releases 2006-2008 &gt; Tournament at the Tower |publisher=Hrp.org.uk |accessdate=2014-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228080515/http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/Pressresources/NewsAndMediaPressresourcesTOLTournamentattheTower |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://middelaldercentret.dk/Events/ridderturneringe.html |title=Ridderturneringer |publisher=Middelaldercentret.dk |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jousting exhibitions are also sometimes featured in [[Renaissance fair]]s or other historical markets.

===Competitive jousting===
''The Knights of Valour'' was a theatrical jousting group formed by [[Shane Adams]] in 1993. Members of this group began to practice jousting competitively, and their first tournament was held in 1997. Adams founded the World Championship Jousting Association (WCJA) as a body dedicated to jousting as a [[combat sport]], which held its inaugural tournament in [[Port Elgin, Ontario]] on 24 July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ICE: Webmaster |url=http://www.aemma.org/training/mounted/mountedTraining.htm |title=Mounted Training at AEMMA |publisher=Aemma.org |accessdate=2014-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615191607/http://www.aemma.org/training/mounted/mountedTraining.htm |archive-date=15 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dashka |last=Slater |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11Jousting-t.html |title=Is Jousting the Next Extreme Sport? |newspaper=New York Times |date= 8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is presented in the 2012 television show ''[[Full Metal Jousting]]'', hosted by Adams. The rules are inspired by ''Realgestech'' (also ''Plankengestech''), one of the forms of ''stechen'' practised in 16th-century Germany, where reinforcing pieces were added to the [[jousting armour]] to serve as designated target areas. Instead of using a shield, the jousters aim for such a reinforcing piece added to the armour's left shoulder known as ''[[:de:Brechschild|Brechschild]]'' (also ''Stechtartsche''). A number of Jousting events are held regularly in Europe, some organised by [[Arne Koets]], including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at [[Schaffhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;"An Interview with Arne Koets, jouster" The Jousting Life, December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Koets is one of a number of Jousters that travels internationally to events.

'''LUMA Foundation''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] established in 2004 that is based out of [[Zurich]] Switzerland. It supports the activities of independent [[contemporary art]]ists and other pioneers working in the fields of art, [[photography]], publishing, documentary, and [[multimedia]]. 

==History==
Established by [[Maja Hoffmann]], the foundation promotes artistic projects combining a particular interest in [[Natural environment|environment]]al issues, [[human rights]], education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/luma-foundation-arles-summer-2011/] LUMA FOUNDATION&lt;/ref&gt; and culture in the broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutch-doc.nl/docupedia/luma+foundation] LUMA Foundation information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
In 2011, the LUMA Foundation launched an acquisition program of books and films for its future library and hosted a symposium in [[Arles]] entitled The Human Snapshot, which brought together a number of leading thinkers to discuss the [[photographic]] image and its impact on [[human rights]].

The LUMA Foundation's focus is to create an experimental cultural complex, the Parc des Ateliers in [[Arles, France]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/summer-program/] The LUMA Foundation in Arles 2013&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to the production of exhibitions and ideas and developed with architect [[Frank Gehry]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2013/07/01/face-a-la-fondation-luma-les-rencontres-se-cherchent-un-espace-perenne_3439295_3246.html] Face à la Fondation Luma, les Rencontres se cherchent un espace pérenne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://provenceventouxblog.com/2013/frank-gehry-in-arles-watershed-moment-arrives-for-ultra-modish-tower-final-presentation-made-by-maja-hoffmann-of-luma-foundation/] Frank Gehry in Arles: Watershed Moment Arrives for Ultra Modish Tower; Final Presentation Made by Maja Hoffmann of Luma Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; This project envisions an [[interdisciplinary]] center for the production of art exhibitions, research, education and archives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://luma-arles.org/solaris-chronicles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180749/http://luma-arles.org/solaris-chronicles/ |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }} Solaris Chronicles&lt;/ref&gt;

POOL is an innovative program that combines the collaboration of an international group of [[private collection|private collectors]] with a mentor-based training programme for [[art curator]]s. The programme has been conceived by [[Beatrix Ruf]], (Director and Curator, [[Kunsthalle]] [[Zürich]] 2001-2014) in collaboration with the founding collectors [[Maja Hoffmann]] and [[Michael Ringier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprivee.org/directory/europe/switzerland/zurich/westbau-the-luma-foundation/] Private Museum Description&lt;/ref&gt;

==LUMA Arles==
LUMA [[Arles]], which launched formally in 2013, is dedicated to providing artists with opportunities to experiment in the production of new work through interdisciplinary collaboration. The conceptualisation of its mission, and the initial programming, has been spearheaded by [[Maja Hoffmann]]. LUMA Arles is an institution dedicated to providing artists with opportunities to experiment in the production and presentation of new work in close collaboration with other [[artists]], [[curators]], [[scientists]], [[innovators]] and [[audiences]]. The centrepiece of the 20-acre LUMA Arles campus is a new Arts Resource Centre building designed by [[Frank Gehry]] to house research and reference facilities, workshop and seminar rooms, and artist studios and presentation spaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/2014/04/08/events/24624/arles-a-historic-weekend] Arles, A Historic Weekend France by Jean-Jacques Naudet&lt;/ref&gt; LUMA Arles also encompasses six historic, large-scale industrial buildings. One historic building, the Grande Halle, was renovated in 2007 by the initiative of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur]] region.  

LUMA Arles works in collaboration with Actes Sud, a major French publishing house known for its work in the arts, humanities, and for children, and the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie, the first post-graduate program to specialise in photography in [[France]]. Every summer, LUMA Arles hosts installations and programs for the international photography festival, [[Rencontres d’Arles]].

==Collaborators==
The Foundation engages in long-term collaborations with institutions like the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] (New York), CCS [[Bard College]] (Annandale-on-Hudson, New York), [[Serpentine Gallery]] and [[Tate Modern]] (London), the [[Kunsthalle Zürich]] and the [[Fotomuseum Winterthur]] (Switzerland). LUMA is a partner of Les Rencontres d’Arles Photographie Awards in [[Arles]].

'''''La nobla leyczon''''' ({{IPA-oc|la ˈnɔbːlɔ lejˈsu|oc}}, ''La nòbla leiçon'' in modern [[Occitan language|Occitan]], "The Noble Lesson") is an anonymous text written in [[Old Occitan]]. It is the founding document&lt;ref&gt;The most important of the Waldensian literature is a poem in Provençal, ''La Nobla Leyczon'', but it is not entirely original, having been edited.[http://www.askwhy.co.uk/christianheresy/0811Inquisition.php]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] creed. Its sixth line, ''ben ha mil &amp; cent an complí entierament'' (already eleven hundred years have run their course [since [[Christ]] died]), places it in the early 12th century but modern scholars now date it between 1190 and 1240.&lt;ref&gt;Bosio, Enrico: La Nobla Leyczon ''considérée au point de vue de la doctrine, de la morale et de l'histoire'', Bulletin de la Société d'Histoire Vaudoise, n° 2 (dic. 1885), pp. 20-36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the very same line varies according to which of the four manuscripts is studied: the [[Geneva]] and [[Dublin]] ones say ''mil e cen'' (1100) while the [[Cambridge]] ones both state ''mil e cccc cent'' (1400).&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Montet, ''La noble leçon, texte original d'après le manuscrit de Cambridge'', 1888, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Further discrepancies include various anachronisms and the fact that Old Occitan was not spoken in the [[Lyon]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Collins, ''Heritage of the Waldensians: a Sketch'', WRS Journal 3:2 (August 1996) 9-15, p.2: This pre-dates Peter of Lyons, who with his followers, were chased from Lyons about 1186, when they joined the valley dwellers, the Valdese. [...] The ''Lesson'' mentions the Vaudois (''Valdense'') as being already persecuted and as having already a well-known history. The idiom of the ''Nobla Leyczon'' is that of the valleys, the Romance language, and not that of the idiom of Lyons, a French dialect, which it would have been if Peter (''Valdo'') and his Poor Men had authored it.[http://www.wrs.edu/Materials_for_Web_Site/Journals/3-2%20Aug-1996/Collins%20-%20Waldensians.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was found in the [[Piedmont]]ese valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffiths &amp; George Edward Griffiths, ''The Monthly Review'', 1825, p. 259 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfhGYUVvr6EC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=noble+lesson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jZ9eTOaRB8Ge4AaY85i5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=noble%20lesson&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 479 lines of the poem can be divided into seven parts according to the themes treated [http://www.info-bible.org/livres/Histoire.Eglise.Vaudoise.2/13.htm#repentance]: 1-56 deal with the [[eschatology|end of the world]]; 57-229 retrace the history of the [[Bible]]; 230-265 tell of the new law; 266-333 narrate Jesus's life and works; 334-360 praise the faithful [[Christian Church]]; 361-413 relate the persecutions and the corrupted lives of [[papist]]s and 414-479 explain what true [[repentance]] is.

* ''Volume 1: Men &amp; Magic''
* ''Volume 2: Monsters &amp; Treasure''
* ''Volume 3: Underworld &amp; Wilderness Adventures''
This original version of ''D&amp;D'' only included a few of the elements considered core to modern ''D&amp;D'' and required the player to own several other games in order to make full use of the rules, however it is considered the first of what is now considered role-playing games and, along with its supplements, is responsible for the creation of the genre itself.

==''Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==

The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set]]'' was the successor to original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and was released while [[TSR, Inc.]] was working on the ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set. This set was the beginning of the split into two separate games, driven by disagreements on the direction the game should take. The Basic set retained the simplicity and flexibility of the original game while [[Gary Gygax]] took ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in a more structured and complicated direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html| title = ''Acaeum: Basic Set''| accessdate = 2010-08-19| publisher = Acaeum| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acaeum.com%2Fddindexes%2Fsetpages%2Fbasic.html&amp;date=2010-08-19| archivedate = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially it was expected that players would start using Basic edition and then graduate to ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax &amp; Arneson (1977) p. 6. states "...experience levels that high are not discussed in this book and the reader is referred to the more complete rules in ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS"&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1981 the ''Basic Set'' underwent a complete revision and not long after this the ''Expert Set'' was released for the first time. All references to a progression from the ''Basic Set'' to ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' were removed from the games and supplements as [[TSR, Inc.]] made clear that the expected progression was from the Basic Set to the Expert Set.  From this point the ''D&amp;D'' dichotomy became fixed and the ''Basic/Expert'' pair were considered a completely separate game from ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/expert.html| title = ''Acaeum: Expert Set''| accessdate = 2010-08-19| publisher = Acaeum| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acaeum.com%2Fddindexes%2Fsetpages%2Fexpert.html&amp;date=2010-08-19| archivedate = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''AD&amp;D'') greatly expanded upon the rules and settings of the original ''D&amp;D'' game when it was released in 1977.  As such, this edition saw the publication of numerous books to assist players. The naming of the core books in this edition became the standard for all later editions.

Around 1983, books such as ''MM'', ''PHB'', ''DMG'' and ''DDG'', all previous hardcover releases except ''Fiend Folio'', were upgraded with new cover art and unified in "orange spine" look. This included only minimal text change such as removal of rape references in ''DMG'' (books are now labeled "ages 10 and up"). ''MM2'' and the rest of the series followed the same format. By the end of its first decade, ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' line had expanded to a library of 14  hardcover rulebooks, including three books of monsters, and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings.

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition==
In 1989, [[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition|''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition]] was published. Initially, the second edition would consolidate the game, with two essential hardcovers and a 3-ring monster document binder that [[Dungeon Master]]s can sort contents as they wish. Periodically, [[TSR (company)|TSR]] published 3 lines of optional rulebooks (PHBR/DMGR/HR) and additional monster compendium to enhance game play.

However, by popular demand TSR released a hardcover monster book in 1993. Also by 1995, with [[Glossary of video game terms#Power creep|power creep]] from optional classes and races becoming prominent, they were forced to abandon their original plan and revise the entire line.&lt;ref&gt;''[[30 Years of Adventure|30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', Wizards of the Coast, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7869-3498-0}} pp.171-175&lt;/ref&gt; Core rules were rewritten, reorganized and accompanied with new logo, new art and black bordered cover style but had only a few meaningful rule changes. Optional rules were also revised and reorganized in hardcover books in the same look.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition and v3.5==
A major revision of the ''AD&amp;D'' rules was released in 2000. As the Basic game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "Advanced" was dropped and the new edition was called just ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', but was still officially referred to as [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition]] (or 3E for short).

This edition was the first to be released by [[Wizards of the Coast]] after their acquisition of the company, as well as the first to allow third-party companies to make supplemental materials by use of the [[Open Game License]]. A series of [[Map Folio]]s were also produced.

In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition ''D&amp;D'' rules (termed [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons version 3.5|version 3.5]]) was released that incorporated numerous rule changes, as well as expanding the ''Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual''.

[[File:Nicky Imber working on head.jpg|thumb|250px|Nicky Imber working on sculpture]]

After escaping the Nazi concentration camp in [[Dachau]],&lt;ref name="TheDaily"&gt;The Daily Journal Friday September 22, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he pledged to dedicate his art to perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust. Among his more famous works are "[[The Hope (Imber)|The Hope]]" and "The Love of Torah". His work can be seen around the world, in [[Northern Israel]], the [[United States]], and the Venezuelan Museum of Natural History in Caracas.

== Biography==
Nicky Imber was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Vienna, he drew anti-Nazi caricatures for Jewish student publications.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni"&gt;Meir Hareuveni, Ma'ariv newspaper, September 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; After several thwarted attempts by the family to leave Vienna, in 1938, in the wake of the '[[Anschluss]]', Imber was deported to [[Dachau]].&lt;ref name="TheDaily" /&gt; Witnessing the murders of family and friends, he plotted his escape. Using skills he had learned in art school, he made a face mask out of bread and sand, stole a Nazi soldier's uniform and walked out the front gate unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Carmiel]],1981 Yad Vashem Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he boarded a ship headed to [[Haifa]]. The ship's passengers were refused entry by the British mandatory authorities and imprisoned in a detention camp in [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1943, Imber worked out a deal with the authorities for his release by joining the British Army, serving as a war artist and a dental assistant in East Africa. After the war, he opened an art school in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and worked as a photographer and a safari guide.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1949 to 1954, he lived in [[Venezuela]], where he was contracted to do an East African [[Diorama]] series. The National Museum added an entire wing to display it.&lt;ref name="VeVenezuela"&gt;Ve Venezuela Vol.2 No.56 April–May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this period he got married and had a daughter Raquel, who accompanied and assisted him.

Between 1961 and 1971 he travelled extensively around Europe and after establishing an international name for himself, returned to the United States. In New York he became famous for his realistic oil paintings of portraits of [[Aga Khan]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Sir Richard Burton]] and [[Simon Bolivar]].&lt;ref name="TheSun"&gt;The Sun Reporter Tuesday July 31, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Venezuela in 1976, Imber created huge sculptures of prehistoric animals, forming one of the world's largest historical animal parks. During this period he also created realistic sculptures of famous Venezuelans for the country's National Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;El Nacional, Caracas, Thursday, April 22, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In 1978, Imber spent three years designing and building a Holocaust memorial park at the entrance to the city of [[Karmiel]] located in the Galilee, entitled 'From Holocaust to Resurrection.'&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt; Imber also established animal theme playgrounds around the city.

The '''''Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai''''' ({{Nihongo|日本美術刀剣保存協会}}) ('''NBTHK''') or '''Society for the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords''' is an agency of the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] whose remit is the registration and preservation of antique [[Japanese sword|swords]].

The [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Japanese Cultural Affairs Agency]] founded the NBTHK in 1948, in response to the [[Occupied Japan|Allied prohibition]] on Japanese swords after [[World War Two]].&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Raid Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords|url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2010/09/30/police-raid-society-for-preservation-of-japanese-art-swords/|publisher=Japan Probe|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RousmaniereMuseum2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicole Coolidge Rousmaniere|author2=British Museum|author3=Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan (Japan) |author4=Kyōto Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan |author5=Nihon Kōgeikai |author6=Kokusai Kōryū Kikin|title=Crafting beauty in modern Japan: celebrating fifty years of the Japan traditional art crafts exhibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRnrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=30 August 2007|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98733-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NBTHK holds annual competitions for modern swordsmiths, which is the highlight of the Japanese sword-making calendar. Success in this competition is a high accolade.&lt;ref name="KappKapp2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leon Kapp|author2=Hiroko T.

The Society issues certification for antique swords. There are four levels of classification in this system: ''hozon'' (worthy of preservation), ''tokubetsu hozon'' (high value work worthy of preservation), ''juyo token'' (important sword) and ''tokubetsu juyo token'' (highest value and importance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Worth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-IJAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=CurtCo.

The '''Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association''' (or '''NEMAA''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization of [[artist]]s and allies in [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast Minneapolis]] in the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]]. NEMAA works to build a more vibrant, diverse and economically healthy community through the arts. NEMAA's vision is to support a community where artists can live, work, and showcase their art. And the mission is to promote connections between individuals, businesses and artists for the collective benefit of our community.

Founded by a small [[collective]] of artists in 1995, today NEMAA has more than 1000 members including artists, students, community friends, non-profit organizations, art galleries, and business members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association - NEMAA|url=https://nemaa.org/about/history/|website=Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association - NEMAA|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMAA's most visible event is Art-A-Whirl, the largest annual open artist studio tour in the U.S., held since 1996.&lt;ref name=rivera2017&gt;Rivera, Erica. A total eclipse of the art? ''Star Tribune'', May 19, 2017, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20045550/northeast_minneapolis_arts_association/ page E1] and [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20045672/northeast_minneapolis_arts_association/ page E12]. Retrieved May 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; During the event artists open their studios to the public, and other performing, visual and educational groups have special art events all around the neighborhoods of Northeast. In 2017, more than 600 artists in 50 locations participated.&lt;ref name=rivera2017 /&gt;

NEMAA publishes an annual Artist Directory and Guide, a year-round guide for visitors to Northeast Minneapolis, Art-A-Whirl, and other arts happenings. NEMAA also coordinates the Fall Fine Arts Show to showcase the artwork of NEMAA artist members. In addition, NEMAA promotes members, artists, and events year-round, including monthly open studio events such as First Thursdays in the Arts District, First Fridays at Q.arma Building, and Saturdays at California Building.

NEMAA was instrumental in establishing the Northeast [[Mississippi River]] on the west, Broadway on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and 27th Avenue on the north.

An '''open-access monograph''' is a scholarly [[monograph]] which is made freely available with a [[Creative Commons Licence|creative commons licence.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Budapest Open Access Initiative  {{!}} Budapest Open Access Initiative|url = http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/|website = www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Open access is when academic research is made freely available for anyone to read and re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|url=http://openaccess.mpg.de/286432/Berlin-Declaration|website=Max Planck Open Access|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[open access journals]], there are different [[business models]] for funding open-access books, including [[Article processing charge|publication charges]], institutional support, [[library publishing]], and consortium models.&lt;ref name=insights&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferwerda|first1=Eelco|title=Open access monograph business models|journal=Insights|date=2014|volume=27|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.118|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/e17587x1kn27p705/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014|issn=2048-7754}}&lt;/ref&gt; OECD Publishing uses a [[freemium]] model by making its books available online in HTML with the option to purchase a print copy.&lt;ref name=insights /&gt; There is some evidence that making electronic editions of books open access can increase sales of the print edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suber|first1=Peter|title=Open access|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book)|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262517638|page=107|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While open access to journal articles has become very common, with 50% of articles published in 2011 available as open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archambault|first1=Eric|last2=Amyot|first2=Didier|last3=Deschamps|first3=Philippe|last4=Nicol,|first4=Aurore|last5=Rebout|first5=Lise|last6=Roberge|first6=Guillaume|title=Proportion of Open Access Peer-Reviewed Papers at the European and World Levels—2004-2011|url=http://www.science-metrix.com/pdf/SM_EC_OA_Availability_2004-2011.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; open access to books has not yet seen as much uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Ellen|last2=Milloy|first2=Caren|title=A snapshot of attitudes towards open access monograph publishing in the humanities and social sciences – part of the OAPEN-UK project|journal=Insights|date=2012|volume=25|issue=2|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.25.2.192|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/727t2j1u17uvgnt2/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are dedicated open-access book publishers such as [[Open Book Publishers]] and others who publish both books and journals, such as [[Open Humanities Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonn|first1=Maria|title=Free exchange of ideas Experimenting with the open access monograph|url=http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/436.short|website=College &amp; Research Libraries News|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in 2015 by the UK's main funding body for research, the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], states the importance of open access monographs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access: A report to HEFCE|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2015/Monographs,and,open,access/2014_monographs.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Monographs are a vitally important and distinctive vehicle for research communication, and must be sustained in any moves to open access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/rereports/year/2015/monographs/|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxblood''' is a color considered to be a dark shade of [[red]]. It resembles [[burgundy (color)|burgundy]], but has more [[purple]] and dark brown [[hue]]s. [[File:Oxblood Red.png|thumb|Oxblood, the color.]]

==Origin of the term==
The first use of the term ''oxblood'' as a color name in the [[English language]] dates back to 1695–1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oxblood |title=Oxblood &amp;#124; Define Oxblood at Dictionary.com |website=Dictionary.reference.com |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from the color of the blood of an ox. The ox blood was used as a pigment to dye fabric, leather and paint. It is most commonly described as a dark red with purple and brown undertones. The blood would change from a bright red to a darker, oxidized, more brown-red as it aged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/question635.htm |title=Why are barns usually painted red? &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |website=Home.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term oxblood can be used to describe a range of colors from red to reddish-purple to nearly black with red, brown and blue undertones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showthread.php?141666-Oxblood-%97-origins |title=Oxblood — origins? |website=Lespaulforum.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color is used in fashion terms.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buerger |first=Megan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/oxblood-red-for-the-rest-of-us/2012/10/09/b9fa4440-0e48-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html |title=Oxblood, red for the rest of us |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-10-10 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular and the name was used frequently in the 2012 Fall/Winter fashion season.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Linda, [http://newsok.com/article/3717256 "Oxblood emerges as hot color for fall"], NewsOK, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern culture==
[[File:Unlaced Dr Martens Oxblood Made in England 1461 shoes.jpg|thumb|A pair of Oxblood-colour [[Dr. Martens]] shoes]]
Oxblood is a relatively common color for [[leather]] shoes.  It is sometimes called "[[cordovan (color)|cordovan]]" although this term more properly refers to a particular type of horse leather.  During the Fall/Winter fashion seasons of 2012 and 2013, oxblood was one of the commonly used colors. Oxblood [[lipstick]] was popular, as well as oxblood-colored apparel and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weil |first=Hannah |url=http://www.fabsugar.com/Oxblood-Trend-Fall-2012-25170259 |title=Oxblood Trend &amp;#124; Fall 2012 &amp;#124; POPSUGAR Fashion |website=Fabsugar.com |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on the oxblood trend, ''Lucky Magazine'' suggested that people are now "dismissing words like burgundy from their vocabularies", adding that the word 'oxblood' might be more on-trend than the color itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymag.com/blogs/luckyrightnow/2012/12/Oxblood |title=Fashion: trends, outfit ideas, what to wear, fashion news and runway looks &amp;#124; Glamour |website=Luckymag.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Park of Laments''''' is a public artwork by [[Chilean people|Chilean]] artist [[Alfredo Jaar]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork consists of an enclosed park space in the form of a square placed within a square, the inner parameter being made from limestone-filled [[gabion]] baskets, and the outer from indigenous  trees and shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The park space is only accessible by a concrete enclosed tunnel. The installation has a landscape design that consists of over 3,000 individual plants species from 53 different genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Park of Laments'' is situated in the woodland area southeast of the lake in 100 acres.  The overall form of the park is a square within a square, one rigid and made of limestone-filled gabion baskets, while the other consisting of indigenous trees and shrubs.  Natural, minimalist wooden benches, made from kiln-treated poplar, are built into the edge of an amphitheater of stairs, vines, and stones. The viewer begins their experience by walking down a concrete platform flanked on both sides with limestone-filled gabion baskets and indigenous shrubbery.  During their walk, the baskets become taller in the form of a progressive step system that correlates with the actual topography of the landscape; the minimum height being at approximately 2’, and the maximum at about 12’.  At that point the viewer is taken underground through a dark, pre-cast concrete “box culvert” tunnel (made of nine individual segments, attached and mortared together) and walk towards the sunlit area on the other end of the tunnel.  The entire length of the tunnel is approximately 72’ in length. The visitor then proceeds up the stairs to reach the enclosed park area, where no other portion of the Art &amp; Nature Park is visible due to both the surrounding gabion baskets and natural woodlands.  There the visitor may sit or interact with the space and be surrounded by over 53 different indigenous plant species located within the installation (more than 3,000 plants total).

==Historical information==
''Park of Laments'' is a project that follows along the lines of Jaar’s Public Intervention series in which the viewer/visitor is an active participant within the environment and contributes to the underlying theme or concept of the project.  Visitors enter the work outside the park and continue through an underground tunnel.  Moving towards the light, they approach stairs that lead them above ground into the center of the park where they are greeted by an isolated, calm, and secluded area conducive to meditation and lamentation.  Like many of Jaar’s Interventions, the intention of the space’s design is to initiate a physical, emotional, and psychological journey within the viewer, ultimately drawing parallels between the experience of physical space and human emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frascina|first=Francis|title=News From Nowhere|url=http://www.alfredojaar.net/press/afterimage/afterimage.html|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Alfred Jaar (b. 1956) is an artist, architect, and filmmaker who lives and works in New York and was born in Santiago de Chile. He attended Instituto Chileno-Norteamericano de Cultura, Santiago (1979) and Universidad de Chile, Santiago (1981).  In addition to Park of Laments, Jaar  has created more than sixty Public Interventions around the world. Alfredo Jaar incorporates photography, film, text, and sculpture into works that look to the relationship between ethics and aesthetics.  His works draw from first-hand witness accounts and research of issues such as toxic waste in Africa, gold mining in Brazil, and genocide in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Art 21on PBS|title=Alfredo Jaar|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/jaar/|accessdate=06/05/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jaar has received many awards, including a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award (2000); a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (1987); and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1987); and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1985). He has had major exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2005); Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (2005); MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1999); and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1992).

==Condition==
In general, the maintenance, upkeep, and conservation of ''Park of Laments'' must be a cooperative effort and responsibility that is shared by conservators, grounds crew, security guards, horticulture personnel, curators, and registrars.   The multifaceted artwork requires the attention of various museum professionals in order to maintain both the physical and conceptual aspects of the installation.

'''Phiale''' is a term in [[Ancient Greek architecture]] for a building or columned arcade around a fountain, the equivalent of the Roman [[nymphaeum]].  The falling water from the fountain was and usually still is collected in a flattish bowl-shaped bowl, the usual meaning of [[Phiale (libation vessel)|phiale]], as a shape for a vessel in [[Ancient Greek pottery]] or silverware.  

In [[Byzantine architecture]] the phiale was also built in the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of, or just outside, a church or the ''[[katholikon]]'' (main church) of a [[monastery]].  Typically, there is an open arcade of columns supporting a small [[dome]], often [[octagon]]al, as a symbol of the mystery ([[sacrament]]) of [[baptism]] or new life. In addition to allowing visitors to wash and refresh themselves before entering the church, the phiale is used for taking water for [[benediction]]s and in the ceremony of the [[Great Blessing of Waters]] at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9593">The '''Prince Philip Designers Prize''' is an annual design recognition given by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]] awarded by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

It is the longest running design award in the United Kingdom, having been started in 1959 as the '''Prize for Elegant Design'''.&lt;ref name="longest"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/house-and-home/brompton-bike-creator-wins-uks-longestrunning-design-award-1804152.html|title=Brompton bike creator wins UK's longest-running design award|work=Independent|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=2009-10-20|quote=Andrew Ritchie was named the winner of the 50th Prince Philip Design Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-fold-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8309975.stm|title=Royal award for fold-up bike man|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2009-10-16|accessdate=2009-10-20|quote=The Duke set up the prize, run by the Design Council, in 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recognition is on the basis of ''a design career which has upheld the highest standards and broken new ground''.&lt;ref name="dc-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Design-Council/2/Press/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize-goes-to-zero-hero-Max-Fordham/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091115082358/http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Design-Council/2/Press/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize-goes-to-zero-hero-Max-Fordham/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-15|title=Notes to editors|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2009-10-20|publisher=Design Council|work=Prince Philip Designers Prize goes to ‘zero hero’ Max Fordham}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 The Duke of Edinburgh stepped down from the prize as he reduced his royal responsibilities in his 90th year.

It was agreed in December 2015 that the Chartered Society of Designers should re-introduce and manage it as a global prize after the [[Design Council]] had ceased in 2011 after managing it for 52 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = https://www.csd.org.uk/awards/prince-philip-designer-prize/|url = https://www.csd.org.uk/awards/prince-philip-designer-prize/|website = www.csd.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many CSD members have received the award over the years including Sir Kenneth Grange CBE PPCSD RDI, David Gentleman and latterly Sir Quentin Blake CBE, FCSD, FRSL, RDI who was awarded the final prize in 2011.

Prince Philip suggested and agreed various changes to the Prize that build on its heritage in order to reflect today’s design profession including opening the Prize to international nominations.

'''Robert von Haug''' (27 May 1857, [[Stuttgart]] - 3 April 1922, Stuttgart) was a German [[impressionist]] painter, illustrator and lithographer who specialized in scenes from the  "[[German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)|Befreiungskriege]]".

== Life ==
From 1872 to 1877, he was enrolled at the {{ill|Stuttgart Kunstschule|de|Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart}}, then spent two years at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where he studied with [[Carl von Häberlin]], [[Bernhard von Neher]] and [[Otto Seitz]]. While there, he was a close associate of [[Karl Stauffer-Bern]] and [[Ludwig von Herterich]]. In 1879, he returned to Stuttgart. His first major exhibitions came after 1883, including one at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], but his chief occupation was book illustrating. He also painted frescoes for the Stuttgart City Hall.

He became a Professor at the Kunstschule in 1894. From 1912 to 1916 he was also the school's Director. One of his best-known students was [[Carl Geist]]. Around 1912 a dispute began between the [[Avant-garde]] faction led by [[Adolf Hölzel]] and the Traditionalists, with whom Haug sided. He was replaced as Director by Hölzel, who resigned three years later when the school rejected [[Paul Klee]] for a teaching post.&lt;ref&gt;Meinrad Schaab, Hansmartin Schwarzmaier (ed.): ''Handbuch der baden-württembergischen Geschichte.''

'''''Seven Easy Pieces''''' was a series of [[performance art|performances]] given by artist [[Marina Abramović]] in [[New York City]] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in November 2005.

Although the performance art world traditionally frowns on repeating individual works, valuing their transient, ephemeral nature as intrinsic to their essence, as she aged, Abramović found herself compelled to preserve the performances that influenced her own development as an artist. Angry at seeing so many of the ideas developed in her and others' performances being appropriated without credit, including by commercial enterprises such as advertising and fashion, Abramović committed herself to archiving seven iconic works by recreating or reinterpreting them in ''Seven Easy Pieces'', but only with the expressed consent of each of the original artists or their estates. "There's nobody to keep the history straight," she told the ''New York Times'' in an interview published in early November 2005. "I felt almost, like, obliged. I felt like I have this function to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/arts/design/06kenn.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| New York Times, ''Self-mutilation is the sincerest form of flattery'', November 6, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seven Easy Pieces'' is available on DVD and is considered{{who|date=August 2018}} to be useful for performing arts students who study [[post-structuralism]]. 

''Seven Easy Pieces'' comprised seven individual works – two of her own and five by other artists – performed on seven consecutive nights beginning on November 9th. They were, in order of performance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/abramovic/ Guggenheim exhibition web page for ''Seven Easy Pieces'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''showgirl''' is a female dancer or performer in a stage entertainment show intended to showcase the performer's physical attributes, typically by way of revealing clothing or even [[toplessness]] or nudity. Showgirls are often associated with [[Latin music]] and dance, particularly [[samba]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The term ''show girl'' is sometimes applied to a [[promotional model]] employed in trade fairs and car shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban on car show girls at Beijing Auto Show gives male attendants center stage|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/26/ban-on-car-show-girls-at-beijing-auto-show-gives-male-attendants-center-stage.html|date=26 April 2016|work=CNBC|author=Haze Fan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Size zero''' or '''size 0''' is a [[dress size|women's clothing size]] in the [[US catalog sizes]] system. Size 0 and 00 were invented due to the changing of clothing sizes over time (referred to as [[vanity sizing]] or size inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 size 0 is equivalent to a 2001 size 2, and is larger than a 1970 size 6 or 1958 size 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/vps/csfiles/cs_215-58.pdf |title=Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel |date=1958 |format=PDF |access-date=2017-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044355/http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/vps/csfiles/cs_215-58.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/stds/womens-ps42-70.pdf |title=Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel |date=1970 |format=PDF |access-date=2017-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307190354/http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/stds/womens-ps42-70.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern size 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32&amp;nbsp;inches (76-56-81&amp;nbsp;cm) to 36-28-36&amp;nbsp;inches (90-71½-90&amp;nbsp;cm).

The use of size 0 in advertisements and products of the clothing industry has been met with some media attention. In July 2009, [[Katie Green]] won a competition to represent [[Wonderbra]]. They referred her to the Premier Model Management agency for representation. Green reported that "one of the guys from the PR agency from Wonderbra" insisted that she lose weight, that it wasn't normal for models to be a (UK) size 8. "Unless I could drop down to that weight, they wouldn't be willing to get me more work."&lt;ref name=interview1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femininebeauty.info/video/katie.green.1.flv |format=Flash video |title=They said I was too fat, says Wonderbra sensation Katie Green |publisher=News of the World|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green at first complied, but then quit the agency. She then, with Liberal Democrat [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Lembit Öpik]], launched a campaign titled "Say No to Size Zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rothstein, Simon|date=16 July 2009|url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/2538649/Katie-Green-teams-up-with-Liberal-Democrat-MP-Lembit-Opik-to-launch-anti-size-zero-campaign.html|title= Katie Green and Lembit Opik team up for campaign|publisher=thesun.co.uk|accessdate= 7 October 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began a petition drive with the goal to put an end to size zero and underweight models on the catwalk or working in the fashion industry. They set a goal to obtain 20,000 signatures and plan to present it to the UK Prime Minister and Parliament.

== Movement against size zero ==
[[File:Victoria_Beckham_2010.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria Beckham, in 2010]]

After the death of [[Luisel Ramos]] from anorexia in August, 2006, Madrid Fashion Week banned size zero models the following month, and the Milan fashion show took the same action shortly afterward, banning models with a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] of 18 or below. As a result, five models were banned from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2006/11/skeletons-on-the-runway-the-size-zero-debate |title=Skeletons on the Runway: The "Size-Zero Debate" &amp;#124; Britannica Blog |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304062710/http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2006/11/skeletons-on-the-runway-the-size-zero-debate |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the British Fashion Council promoted the creation of a task force to establish guidelines for the fashion industry. They also urged fashion designers to use healthy models.

Italian fashion labels [[Prada]], [[Versace]] and [[Armani]] have agreed to ban size zero models from their catwalks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2006/12/10/prada-joins-versace-to-ban-size-zero-models-446088/ ''Metro'']&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new self-regulation code drawn up in Italy by the government and designers, all models in future shows will be "full-bodied", and larger sizes will be introduced at shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/italy-bans-too-thin-models/ CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]] has given support to the effort to eliminate ultra-thin models. "The time has now come for clarity. We all need to work together against [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]."

[[Israel]] banned underweight models in March 2012. Their law stipulates that women and men hired as models must be certified by a physician as having a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] of no less than 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ibtimes.com/israel-passes-law-to-ban-underweight-models/4251.html |title=Israel Passes Law to Ban Underweight Models |first=Sally |last=Turner | date= Mar 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also requires the inclusion of an informational note in adverts using photos manipulated to make models look thinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel bans use of ultra-skinny models|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/israel-models-law-idUSL6E8EJ3IT20120320|newspaper=Reuters|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were divergent views on the ban within the Israeli fashion industry. One modelling agent, who had helped promote the bill, suggested that the fall in typical dress sizes for models in the preceding 15–20 years amounted to "the difference between death and life". However, another described the law as "arbitrary" and "not appropriate for every model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel passes law banning use of underweight models|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450275|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sundberg-Ferar''' is an [[industrial design]] consultancy headquartered in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]].  Founded in 1934 by partners Carl Sundberg (1910–1982) and Montgomery Ferar (1910–1982), the company was among the first industrial design firms to be established in the U.S.

Sundberg-Ferar employs approximately 20 employees in the disciplines of [[industrial design]], [[mechanical engineering]], research, model making and prototyping, [[interaction design]] and packaging design.  The firm has designed products for hundreds of clients in categories such as [[home appliances]] and housewares, automotive and medical products, [[consumer electronics]], industrial equipment, [[mass transit]] vehicles, [[vending machines]] and aircraft interiors.

==Company history==
In 1934, founders Sundberg and Ferar were working together at the [[General Motors]] Art &amp; Color Section under [[Harley J. Earl]] when they decided to leave and start their own firm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carofthecentury.com/harley_earl_design.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They remained partners and owners of Sundberg-Ferar until 1975, when they retired from the firm.  Company ownership has transitioned internally ever since.

Originally located in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], Sundberg-Ferar became one of the leading independent design offices after [[World War II]].  The firm also pioneered the use of design to create corporate image, coordinating a look for [[IBM]]'s early computers and showrooms in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Toledo Museum of Art, "The Alliance of Art and Industry: Toledo Designs for a Modern America", 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Company headquarters moved from [[Detroit]] to [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] and then to [[Southfield, Michigan]] in 1959.  In 1995, the company moved to its current location in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]] where it operates within a 15,000 sq. ft. purpose-built structure.  The building is divided into an 8,000 sq. ft. [[prototype]] shop and a 7,000 sq. ft. multi-disciplinary office space that includes a large [[focus group]]/viewing facility.

During the 1990s,  the company opened offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Minneapolis]] and [[Chicago]], but closed these offices in a restructuring effort in 2002-2004.

In addition to Montgomery ("Monte") Ferar and Carl Sundberg, many noteworthy U.S. industrial designers of the 20th century at one time worked at Sundberg-Ferar, including Carl "Cam" Cameron, Samuel M. Highberger, Norman J. James and Clair Samhammer.

At its 2016 International Conference in Detroit, Michigan, the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) awarded Carl and Monte the "Personal Recognition Award" for their contribution to industrial design's long-term welfare and importance.

==Project history==
During the 1930s-1960's, the firm's design and styling projects represented a broad range of product categories, including [[household goods]] and appliances, office and industrial equipment, automobiles, boats and furniture.  Notable design work from that period included:
*[[Crosley]] Pavilion - New York World's Fair (1939)
*[[Crosley]] CC automobile (1945)
*DeVilbiss Co. air compressor (1948)
*[[IBM 702]] computer (1954)
*[[IBM 305 RAMAC]] business computer (first disk drive and architectural character to fit office decor)  (1957)
*[[RCA]]/[[Whirlpool]] "Miracle Kitchen"  (1957)
*J.P. [[Seeburg Corporation]] [[jukebox]] (KD-200, L-series - 1957; Q100, Q160 and 3W100 Wall-O-Matic - 1960)
*[[IBM]] Model C electric typewriter (1959)
*[[Sears]], Roebuck &amp; Company Tower Capri typewriter (1961)

Beginning in the 1960s, Sundberg-Ferar became heavily involved in the design of mass transit vehicles.
*[[New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] [[R40/A (New York City Subway car)|R40M]] subway transit vehicles &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycsubway.org/cars/r40.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Design in Steel Award 1969)
*[[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BARTD) System vehicles (designed in 1965, introduced 1972)

*[[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] vehicles (1980's)
*[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] vehicles (1985–1989)

[[File:Pessoacopo.jpg|thumb|right| Fernando Pessoa drinking a glass of wine in a tavern in 1929.]]

'''''The Book of Disquiet''''' ('''''Livro do Desassossego: Composto por Bernardo Soares, ajudante de guarda-livros na cidade de Lisboa''''') is a work by the Portuguese author [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Published posthumously, ''The Book of Disquiet'' is a fragmentary lifetime project, left unedited by the author, who introduced it as a "factless autobiography."
The publication was credited to Bernardo Soares, one of the author's alternate writing names, which he called [[heteronym (literature)|semi-heteronym]]s, and had a preface attributed to Fernando Pessoa, another alternate writing name or [[heteronym (literature)|orthonym]].

== Editions ==
{{quote|In Lisbon there are a few restaurants or eating houses located above decent-looking taverns, places with the heavy, domestic look of restaurants in towns far from any rail line. These second-story eateries, usually empty except on Sundays, frequently contain curious types whose faces are not interesting but who constitute a series of digressions from life.|Fernando Pessoa, from ''The Book of Disquiet'', trans. Alfred MacAdam.}}

Much studied by "Pessoan" critics, who have different interpretations regarding the book's proper organization, ''The Book of Disquiet'' was first published in Portuguese in 1982, 47 years after Pessoa's death (the author died at age 47 in 1935). The book has seen publication in Spanish (1984), German (1985), Italian (1986), French (1988), and English (1991). The ''Book'' in 1991 had four English editions by different translators: [[Richard Zenith]] (editor and translator), Iain Watson, Alfred MacAdam and [[Margaret Jull Costa]]. The ''Book'' is a bestseller, especially in German (16 editions, from different translators and publishers).

The book was listed on the [[Bokklubben World Library|Norwegian Book Clubs list of the 100 best works of fiction of all time]], based on the responses of 100 authors from 54 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/content/view/print/505597/|title=The 100 best books of all time|date=2012-06-12|accessdate=2012-10-20|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|first=Molly|last=Driscoll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Teresa Sobral Cunha]] considers that there are two versions of ''The Book of Disquiet''. According to Cunha, who with [[Jacinto do Prado Coelho]] and [[Maria Aliete Galhoz]] edited the first edition in 1982, there are two authors of the book: [[Vicente Guedes]] in a first phase (in the 1910s and 20s), and the aforementioned [[Bernardo Soares]] (late 1920s and 30s).

However, [[António Quadros]] considers that the first phase of the book belongs to Pessoa himself. The second phase, more personal and diary-like, is the one credited to Bernardo Soares.

Richard Zenith, editor of a new Portuguese edition in 1998, took the option of presenting a single volume, as in his English translation of 1991. In his introduction, he writes that "if Bernardo Soares does not measure up to the full Pessoa, neither are his diary writings the sum total of ''Disquietude'', to which he was after all a johnny-come-lately. ''The Book of Disquietude'' was various books (yet ultimately one book), with various authors (yet ultimately one author), and even the word ''disquietude'' changes meaning as time passes."&lt;ref&gt;PESSOA, Fernando, ''The Book of Disquietude'', tr. Richard Zenith, Carcanet Press, 1991, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'''[[George Steiner]] on ''The Book Of Disquiet'': '''

"The fragmentary, the incomplete is of the essence of Pessoa's spirit. The very kaleidoscope of voices within him, the breadth of his culture, the catholicity of his ironic sympathies – wonderfully echoed in Saramago's great novel about Ricardo Reis – inhibited the monumentalities, the self-satisfaction of completion. Hence the vast torso of Pessoa's ''Faust'' on which he laboured much of his life. Hence the fragmentary condition of ''The Book of Disquiet,'' which contains material that predates 1913 and which Pessoa left open-ended at his death. As Adorno famously said, the finished work is, in our times and climate of anguish, a lie.&lt;br/&gt;

"It was to Bernardo Soares that Pessoa ascribed his ''Book of Disquiet'', first made available in English in a briefer version by Richard Zenith in 1991. The translation is at once penetrating and delicately observant of Pessoa's astute melancholy. What is this ''Livro do Desassossego''? Neither 'commonplace book', nor 'sketchbook', nor 'florilegium' will do. Imagine a fusion of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s [[Coleridge's notebooks|notebooks]] and marginalia, of Valéry's philosophic diary and of Robert Musil's voluminous journal. Yet even such a hybrid does not correspond to the singularity of Pessoa's chronicle. Nor do we know what parts thereof, if any, he ever intended for publication in some revised format."&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, "A Man of Many Parts," ''The Observer'', Sunday, 3 June 2001. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jun/03/poetry.features1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background and publication history==

Like his other posthumous work, ''The Nick Adams Stories'' may have been reworked and edited in a manner he never intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fame beyond the grave |author=Nicolette Jones |newspaper=Telegraph |date= 3 Jul 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5720775/Fame-beyond-the-grave.html |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer for ''The New York Times'' had this to say about one of the stories "Three Shots", a section Hemingway originally cut from "[[Indian Camp]]" – one of his earliest stories first published in 1925 volume ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Alone, "Three Shots" stands as a vignette of a boy's fear, accorded sympathy by his father and impatience by his uncle. As part of the stark and spare "Indian Camp," however, it was clearly excess baggage and, knowing that it was cut out, one can only read it with admiration for the nascent and ruthlessly true artistic impulse that caused its excision.&lt;ref name=NYTNickAdams/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contrary to the above are those who welcome publication of the new Nick Adams material which fills in chronological gaps of the autobiographical character's experience, and thus shows much of Hemingway's own life that remained unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Nick Adams Stories |author=|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |date= April 16, 1972 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NlEcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cloEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3812,2410250&amp;dq=hemingway+posthumous+nick+adams&amp;hl=en |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}

'''''The Reading''''' ('''''La Lecture''''' in French) is a painting by French painter [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] in 1877.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite web |title=Henri-Fantin Latour — ''La Lecture'' |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_98=APTN&amp;VALUE_98=Tempelaere&amp;NUMBER=23&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28Tempelaere%29%20%3aAPTN%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=1&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=1&amp;MAX3=100&amp;DOM=All |publisher=Culture .gouv |language=French |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired in 1901 by the city of Lyon and by the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]] where it is currently conserved. 

The painting depicts two women sitting in a room. The woman on the right is reading a book, leaning on a table covered with a decorative patterned [[tablecloth]] and a vase with some flowers. The other woman, on the left, seems not to listen to the reading as she appears to be distracted. Both the background wall, which holds a large part of the painting, and the black dresses of both women are very austere.

The theme of the work can evoke the escape of women by reading. The woman on the left represents the artist's [[sister-in-law]], Charlotte Dubourg. The painting was exhibited in 1877 at the [[Salon (Paris)]], in 1878 at the summer exhibition of the [[Royal Academy]] in London, and in 1900 at the Société des Beaux-Arts in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;

During the Biennial of Contemporary Art in 2009 in Lyon, artist Wong Hoy Cheong reinterpreted the painting in a photograph of Muslim women wearing a [[burqa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biennale de Lyon |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2009/09/17/biennale-de-lyon/ |publisher=Lunettes rouges |date=17 September 2009 |language=French |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Princes of Serendip''''' is the English version of the story ''[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Peregrinaggio_di_tre_giovani_figliuoli_del_re_di_Serendippo Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo]'' published by Michele Tramezzino in Venice in 1557. Tramezzino claimed to have heard the story from one [[:it:Cristoforo Armeno|Cristoforo Armeno]], who had translated the [[Persian language|Persian]] [[fairy tale]] into Italian, adapting Book One of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khusrau]]'s ''[[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht-Bihisht]]''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Ben-Amos | first = Dan | title = Folktales of the Jews: Tales from Eastern Europe | publisher = Jewish Publication Society | page = 318 | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8276-0830-6|display-authors=etal}}, accessible [https://books.google.com/books?id=vW-9E_fFSOUC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=Hasht+Bihisht+written+by+Amir+Khusrau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AJJRu55iPu&amp;sig=AQxaOi_FCBguAcaksSqO-POKZ34&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XaemSaz2EdSyjAf95uziDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA318,M1|here]&lt;/ref&gt; of 1302. The story first came to English via a French translation, and now exists in several out-of-print translations.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Remer, T. G., Ed.

The story has become known in the English-speaking world as the source of the word [[serendipity]], coined by [[Horace Walpole]] because of his recollection of the part of the "silly fairy tale" in which the three princes by "accidents and sagacity" discern the nature of a lost camel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yallop | first = C | authorlink = Macquarie Dictionary | title = Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition | publisher = The Macquarie Library pty Ltd | year = 2005 | location = Sydney, NSW, Australia | url = | isbn = 1876429143 | page = 1290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate line of descent, the story was used by [[Voltaire]] in his 1747 ''[[Zadig]]'', and through this contributed to both the evolution of [[detective fiction]] and the self-understanding of [[scientific method]].

==The story==
"In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need."

The father searches out the best possible tutors. "And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be immediately recognized as his very own."

When the tutors are pleased with the excellent progress that the three princes make in the arts and sciences, they report it to the king. He, however, still doubts their training, and summoning each in turn, declares that he will retire to the contemplative life leaving them as king. Each politely declines, affirming the father's superior wisdom and fitness to rule.

The king is pleased, but fearing that his sons' education may have been too sheltered and privileged, feigns anger at them for refusing the throne and sends them away from the land.

===The lost camel===
No sooner do the three princes arrive abroad than they trace clues to identify precisely a camel they have never seen. They conclude that the camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant woman, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. When they later encounter the merchant who has lost the camel, they report their observations to him. He accuses them of stealing the camel and takes them to the [[Bahram V|Emperor Beramo]], where he demands punishment.

Beramo then asks how they are able to give such an accurate description of the camel if they have never seen it. It is clear from the princes' replies that they have used small clues to infer cleverly the nature of the camel.

Grass had been eaten from the side of the road where it was less green, so the princes had inferred that the camel was blind on the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth, they inferred they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the other.

As for the woman, one of the princes said: "I guessed that the camel must have carried a woman, because I had noticed that near the tracks where the animal had knelt down the imprint of a foot was visible. Because some urine was nearby, I wet my fingers and as a reaction to its odour I felt a sort of carnal [[concupiscence]], which convinced me that the imprint was of a woman’s foot."

"I guessed that the same woman must have been pregnant," said another prince, "because I had noticed nearby handprints which were indicative that the woman, being pregnant, had helped herself up with her hands while urinating."

At this moment, a traveller enters the scene to say that he has just found a missing camel wandering in the desert. Beramo spares the lives of the three princes, lavishes rich rewards on them, and appoints them to be his advisors.

===The story continues===
The three princes have many other adventures, where they continue to display their sagacity, stories-within-stories are told, and, of course, there is a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;For a little more detail see Richard Boyle's retelling of the tale here [http://livingheritage.org/three_princes-2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The fairy tale ''The Three Princes of Serendip'' is based upon the life of Persian King [[Bahram V]], who ruled the [[Sassanid Empire]] (420–440). Stories of his rule are told in epic poetry of the region ([[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of 1010, [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|Haft Paykar]]'' of 1197, [[Amir Khusro|Khusrau]]'s [[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht Bihisht]] of 1302), parts of which are based upon historical facts with embellishments derived from folklore going back hundreds of years to oral traditions in India and ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''. With the exception of the well-known camel story,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, The Lost Camel in [[Idries Shah]]'s collection ''[[World Tales]]''. The author mentions that an ancient saying, "Faith is the lost camel of the Believer", has been said to allude to this tale. The same story is found in ''Tales of the Sun Or Folklore of Southern India'' by Mrs Howard Kingscote (Georgiana Kingscote) and Pandit Natêśa Sástrî, accessible here [https://books.google.com/books?id=dRiG80JN13EC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=%22lost+camel%22+king+alakesa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AI6sNgOJV-&amp;sig=wQAi3I12qsmuH96ic6cqteK131M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCSlSezlBdSyjAe7xKzCBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA140,M1].&lt;/ref&gt; English translations are very hard to come by.

===Talmudic version===
A version of the fable of a camel blind in one eye is included in the [[Talmud]], attributed to [[Rabbi Yochanan]]. While it might be seen as implying that gentiles, in comparison to Jews, are rude and defecate on the road, it is worth noting that Jewish law has strong injunctions of modesty and cleanliness, including strict injunctions against open or public urination or defecation.

{{quote|
Rava relates the following in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:—“Two Jewish slaves were one day walking along, when their master, who was following, overheard the one saying to the other, ‘There is a camel ahead of us, as I judge—for I have not seen—that is blind of one eye and laden with two skin-bottles, one of which contains wine and the other oil, while two drivers attend it, one of them an Israelite, and the other a Gentile.’ ‘You perverse men,’ said their master, ‘how can you fabricate such a story as that?’ The slave answered, and gave this as his reason, ‘The grass is cropped only on one side of the track, the wine, that must have dripped, has soaked into the earth on the right, and the oil has trickled down, and may be seen on the left; while one of the drivers turned aside from the track to ease himself, but the other has not even left the road for the purpose.’ Upon this the master stepped on before them in order to verify the correctness of their inferences, and found the conclusion true in every particular. He then turned back, and ... after complimenting the two slaves for their shrewdness, he at once gave them their liberty.”
|Sanhedrin, fol. 104, col. 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/hl/hl05.htm Hebraic Literature: Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim, and Kabbala], chapter II. A similar version is contained in the 5th-century CE [[Midrash]] collection ''[[Lamentations Rabbah]]'', perhaps the oldest written version that we have.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Zadig===
[[File:VoltaireZadig.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[Voltaire]]'s [[Zadig]]]]
In chapter three of [[Voltaire]]'s 1747 novel [[Zadig]], there is an adaptation of ''The Three Princes of Serendip'', this time involving, instead of a camel, a horse and a dog, which the eponymous Zadig is able to describe in great detail from his observations of the tracks on the ground. When he is accused of theft and taken before the judges, Zadig clears himself by recounting the mental process which allows him to describe the two animals he has never seen: "I saw on the sand the tracks of an animal, and I easily judged that they were those of a little dog. Long, shallow furrows imprinted on little rises in the sand between the tracks of the paws informed me that it was a bitch whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she had had puppies a few days before."

Zadig's detective work was influential.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Carlo Ginzburg; translated by|authorlink =Carlo Ginzburg|title=Clues, myths, and the historical method|year=1992|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0-8018-4388-4|page=116|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.|author2=Tedeschi, Anne C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:
{{quote|"Today, anyone who sees only the print of a cloven hoof might conclude that the animal that had left it behind was a ruminator, and this conclusion is as certain as any in physics and in ethics. This footprint alone, then, provides the observer with information about the teeth, the jawbone, the vertebrae, each leg bone, the thighs, shoulders and pelvis of the animal which had just passed: it is a more certain proof than all Zadig's tracks."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg /&gt;}}
[[T. H. Huxley]], the proponent of Darwin’s theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article "The method of Zadig":
{{quote|"What, in fact, lay at the foundation of all Zadig’s arguments, but the coarse, commonplace assumption, upon which every act of our daily lives is based, that we may conclude from an effect to the pre-existence of a cause competent to produce that effect?"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 17/August 1880/On the Method of Zadig|On the Method of Zadig in Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his turn was probably inspired by Zadig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kewer|first=Edgar Allan Poe; edited by Thomas Ollive Mabbott with the assistance of Eleanor D.|title=1831 - 1842.|year=2000|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|location=Urbana [u.a.]|isbn=978-0252069222|page=521|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g33tFaUbpIMC&amp;lpg=PA522&amp;dq=poe%20had%20read%20voltaire's%20zadig&amp;pg=PA521#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Illinois paperback.|author2=Mabbott, Maureen C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panek|first=Leroy Lad|title=An introduction to the detective story|year=1987|publisher=Bowling Green state university popular press|location=Bowling Green Ohio|isbn=978-0879723781|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xstGp7cOObMC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=The%20Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue%20source%20voltaire&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when he created [[C. Auguste Dupin]] in "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", calling it a "tale of ratiocination" wherein "the extent of information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation."
Poe's M. Dupin stories mark the start of the modern [[detective fiction]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Kenneth|title=Edgar A.

'''''This is For You, Anna''''' is a 1983 play devised by a collective of women based out of [[Toronto]] theatre company [[Nightwood Theatre]]. Initially developed as a 20-minute production for the Women's Perspective Festival&lt;ref&gt;''This is For You, Anna'' The Canadian Theatre Review Anthology, ed. Alan Filewod, 1993, University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt;  ''This is For You, Anna'' was re-written for longer performances, and went on to tour Canada and Britain throughout the 80's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nightwood-theatre/ ,'Nightwood Theatre', The Canadian Encyclopedia, Emily Gerhard and Rob Crew, Published 11/28/11, Last edited 03/04/15&lt;/ref&gt; The play was created collectively in response to a current event of the time wherein German woman [[Marianne Bachmeier]] walked into a courtroom and shot the man who killed her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;'Enacting ''This is For You, Anna''', Shelley Scott, ''Canadian Theatre Review'', Issue 121, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist play explores themes of violence, revenge, domesticity, and questions the roles of western women at the end of the 20th century.

==Collective creation==

''This is For You, Anna'' was developed through the process of collective creation. This medium operates from a foundation of performers' own ideas and experiences, and the final production is largely devised within the rehearsal process itself. This differs from more traditional means of theatre creation in which the script is written independently of the rehearsal process, the cast are aware of their roles before the process begins, and the actors have less of a say in the content of the piece. Additionally, many collective creation plays are characterized by an episodic, [[nonlinear narrative]], actors playing multiple characters within the narrative, and a collaborative creative process which often explores the creators' own interests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/collective-creation/, 'Collective Creation', The Canadian Encyclopedia, Alan Filewod, Published 02/07/06, Last Edited 03/04/15&lt;/ref&gt; The qualities of collective creation are evident in ''This is For You, Anna'', as it rejects a linear chronology, each actor plays a number of roles (including each of the four actors portraying a different incarnation of [[Marianne Bachmeier]] herself), and the original cast of actors were also intimately involved in the creation of the text.

==The script==

''This is For You, Anna'' is a [[one-act play]] composed of eight scenes which flow together thematically, though are not necessarily connected chronologically. The play makes use of a lyrical poetic style, and live accordion music is used to accompany frequent musical numbers which help to tell the story. This music does not work to create a traditionally polished [[musical theatre]] aesthetic. Rather, the music and storytelling create an ethereal, experimental 'folk' atmosphere characteristic of the early days of [[Nightwood Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;'Nightwood Theatre: A Woman's Work is Always Done', Shelley Scott, ''Canadian Theatre Review'', Issue 132, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently recurring character in the play is [[Marianne Bachmeier]] who is played by each of the four actors throughout the play. This is indicated in the script as characters named Marianne 1, 2, 3, and 4.

===Plot summary===

The play opens on all four actors as different embodiments of Marianne, each in their own worlds. They reflect on the act of walking into the courtroom before the shooting. The scene transitions into that of a mother telling her daughter a bedtime story in which a woman is tortured by a wealthy baron she loves. The daughter reimagines the ending of the story to include the woman getting revenge on the man who tortured her, and the accordionist turns this new ending into a song. Scene three begins with a narrator providing backstory on Marianne's life, and a brief overview of the event which inspired the play. All four actors then embody Marianne at different points of her life, having conversations with various other absent characters such as Anna (her daughter who was killed), her ex-partner, and an interviewer visiting her in prison. In scene four, the actors tell a paraphrased version of the Roman legend of [[Lucretia]], which is reinterpreted to focus on the parallels between Marianne's own story and the legend itself: namely [[victim blaming]] and a desire for revenge. In scene five, the four actors take on characters which speak to their own experiences with abuse and violence. They perform regimented choreography and talk amongst themselves; engaging in dialogue which communicates nuanced perspectives on the complications of living with and leaving abusive partners. Scene six deals with media portrayals of 'victims' and positions these as potentially problematic. In this scene, one of the actors takes on an 'interviewer' role, grills the other three with personal questions, and demands them to perform certain acts on command. In scene seven, all actors take on the role of Marianne once more, and delve into her intimate thoughts and feelings surrounding the courtroom shooting. The play concludes with 'The Jury Scene' in which the actors take on the role of the jury which found Marianne guilty of murdering the man who murdered her daughter. The characters in this scene condemn Marianne for her actions and defend the man's point of view (who argued in court that Marianne's seven-year-old daughter had flirted with him which led him to commit the murder). These perspectives are written in small snippets, to be spoken rapidly by the cast in order to create an overwhelming crescendo for the audience. This shifts abruptly when the actors all resume their roles as Mariannes 1 through 4, and quietly support and affirm their actions to each other. The play ends.&lt;ref&gt;''This is For You, Anna'' The Canadian Theatre Review Anthology, ed. Alan Filewod, 1993, University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treasure of Guarrazar''', [[Guadamur]], [[Province of Toledo]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]], is an  [[Archaeology|archeological]] find composed of twenty-six [[votive crown]]s and gold [[cross]]es that had originally been offered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by the [[Visigoth|Kings of the Visigoths]] in the seventh century in [[Hispania]], as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm Musée National du Moyen Âge, Hôtel de Cluny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}: the Musée de Cluny conserves one of the votive crowns.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king [[Reccesuinth]] with its blue [[sapphire]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[pendilia]].  Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.

The treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work,&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Guerra, T. Galligaro, A. Perea, "The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula", ''Archeometry'' '''49'''.1 (2007) pp. 53-74.&lt;/ref&gt; was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called ''Guarrazar'', in [[Guadamur]], very close to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]]. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the [[Musée de Cluny]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Fallow |first=Thomas Macall |wstitle=Crown and Coronet |volume=7 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest to the armouries of the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]] (today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.

Some comparable Visigothic [[filigree]] gold was found in 1926 at [[Torredonjimeno]] in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Described and compared in Alicia Perea, "Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures," ''Historic Metallurgy'' '''40'''.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic world]] and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.

The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King [[Reccesuinth]] and one of King [[Suinthila]]. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.

These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

*  [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
*  [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
*  [[Musée de Cluny|National Museum of the Middle Ages]], [[Paris]]: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman [[sanctuary]] or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a  Latin inscription that  mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of [[Égica]], year of the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]]). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.

According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.

'''Vernacular architecture''' is an [[architectural style]] that is designed based on local needs, availability of [[construction material]]s and reflecting local traditions. Traditionally, vernacular architecture did not use formally-schooled [[architect]]s, but relied on the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. However, since the late 19th century many professional architects have worked in this style and interest in vernacular architecture now forms part of a broader interest in sustainable design.

Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against [[polite architecture]] which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term '''traditional architecture''', which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vernaculus'', meaning "domestic, native, indigenous"; from ''verna'', meaning "native [[slave]]" or "home-born slave". The word probably derives from an older [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vernacular|title=Vernacular|publisher=online etymology dictionary|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=vernacular|publisher=yourdictionary.com|title=Vernacular(noun)|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020608/windows/roots.htm|title=Fiddling with words, again!|date=June 8, 2002|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is borrowed from [[linguistics]], where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group. In architecture, it refers to that type of architecture which is [[Indigenous knowledge|indigenous]] to a specific time or place (not imported or copied from elsewhere). It is most often applied to [[residential]] buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vernacular Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88049&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge advanced learner's dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vernacular Merriam–Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The terms [[vernacular]], [[Folk culture|folk]], [[traditional]], and [[wikt:popular|popular]] architecture are sometimes used synonymously. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in ''Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions'' where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or ''folk architecture'' is built by "persons not professionally trained in building arts"; where ''vernacular architecture'' is still ''of the common people'' but may be built by trained professionals such as through an [[apprenticeship]], but still using local, traditional designs and materials. ''Traditional architecture'' is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term ''primitive architecture'' as having a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings: a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I. B. Tauris, 2007. 1-17. Print.{{ISBN|9781845113056}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term popular architecture is used more in eastern Europe and is synonymous with folk or vernacular architecture.&lt;ref&gt;The meanings in this paragraph are supported by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Vernacular, a. and n., 6.; Folk 2. a.; Tradition, n., 4. a.; Traditional, a. (n.), 1. a.; Popular, a.(n.), 2. a.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Ronald Brunskill]] has defined the ultimate in vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000 pages 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called "traditional" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of [[polite design]]: [[temples]] and [[palaces]], for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of "vernacular." In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with '[[the polite]]', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional [[architect]] for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content,&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.
[[File:TraditionalArchitectureTurzaLaRioja.jpg|thumb|Dwelling of [[half-timbered]] construction on stone foundation, [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain]]
The ''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'' defines vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'', volume 1, page not cited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vernacular architecture is a broad, [[grassroots]] concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vernaculararchitecture.com/{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a site which is part of http://www.ethnoarchitecture.org/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507021335/http://ethnoarchitecture.org/ |date=2013-05-07 }} accessed 5/2/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as [[folk art]] is contrasted with [[fine art]].
&lt;!--Better to keep this concise and include in country specific sections as article is expanded. In Japan, for example, not all pre-modern architecture is "vernacular," which would usually refer only to rural buildings and [[structures]]. In the [[US]], vernacular architecture might refer to a so-called craftsman [[bungalow]], fashionable in the nineteenth century, even though the bungalow as an architectural form did not originate in the US. "Vernacular" might even refer to a building like the 1848 Duncan House in [[Cooksville]], [[Wisconsin]]. --&gt;

==Vernacular and the architect==
Architecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. [[Paul Oliver]], in his book ''Dwellings'', states: "...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Oliver |title=Dwellings |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2003 |origyear= |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0-7148-4202-8 |page= |pages= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: ''"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people."&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] described vernacular architecture as "Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|9}} suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was "for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe".

[[File:Velika planina 031.JPG|thumbnail|right|A post-World War II dwelling at the [[Big Pasture Plateau]], [[Slovenia]], designed by the architect [[Vlasto Kopač]] and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area.]]

Since at least the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the [[Egypt]]ian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] was appointed to design the town of [[New Gourna]] near [[Luxor]]. Having studied traditional [[Nubian people|Nubian]] settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

In 1964 the exhibition ''Architecture Without Architects'' was put on at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] by [[Bernard Rudofsky]]. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: "For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be."&lt;ref name=Rudofsky&gt;Rudofsky, ''Architecture Without Architects'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.

Sri Lankan architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]] is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in [[South Asia]]. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include [[Charles Correa]], a well known Indian architect; [[Muzharul Islam]] and [[Bashirul Haq]], internationally known [[List of Bangladeshi architects|Bangladeshi architects]]; [[Balkrishna Doshi]], another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in [[Ahmedabad]] to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was also a proponent of vernacular architecture.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be [[Samuel Mockbee]], [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Paolo Soleri]].

Oliver claims that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Architects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design. &lt;ref&gt;Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C.,  "The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, ''Lessons from Vernacular Architecture'', Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on the vernacular==
[[File:Brgule 001.jpg|thumb|House in [[Brgule]], Serbia]]
Vernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in [[structural engineering|structural forms]].

One of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.

[[File:Múzeum kysuckej dediny-1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[log cabin]] in the region of [[Kysuce]] ([[Slovakia]]) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials ([[wood]]).]]
Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elemens included such design features as courtyards gardens with water features, scree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  n walls, reflected light, ''[[mashrabiya]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]).&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|Queenslander, Australia]]
Buildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region – leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states.&lt;ref name="LinOsb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Lindy|title=Sublime design: the Queenslander|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/sublime-design-the-queenslander|website=Architecture &amp; Design|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.

Climatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.

===Culture===
The way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.

For example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.

Culture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.

====Nomadic dwellings====
[[File:cempa stilthouses.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the [[Lingga Islands]] of Indonesia.]]
[[File:Yurt-construction-2.JPG|thumb|A [[Yurt]] or ger, a circular dwelling from [[Mongolia]], during erection]]
[[File:igloo.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[Igloo]], an [[Inuit]] winter dwelling]]
There are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]], and if necessary, transport such as [[tent]]s.

The [[Inuit]] people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the [[igloo]] (for winter) and the [[tupiq]] (for summer). The [[Sami people|Sami]] of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|25}} including the [[lavvu]] and [[goahti]]. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.

Many nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their [[yurt|gers]] (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.

All the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Permanent dwellings====
[[File:Lesotho Slide Show (294).JPG|thumb|A Southern African rondavel (or banda)]]

The type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.

Materials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately "designed" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.

Over time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.

===Environment, construction elements and materials===
The local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding [[Tankhouse|(tankhouses)]] were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.

Construction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:
* [[Adobe]] - a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies
* [[Windcatcher|Bad girs]] -a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East
* [[Cob (material)|Cob]] - a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength
* [[Mashrabiya]] - (also known as shanashol in Iraq) - a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes
* [[Mudbrick|Mud brick]]s - loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw
* [[Rammed earth]] often used in foundations
* [[Thatching|Thatch]] - dry vegetation used as roofing material
* [[Wychert]] - a blend of white earth and clay

==Literature==
Following the eclipse by [[International Modernism]] of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American [[Arts and Crafts]] buildings and European [[National Romanticism]], an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was [[Bernard Rudofsky]]'s 1964 book ''[[Architecture Without Architects|Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture]]'', based on his [[MoMA]] exhibition.  The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and "hard-won knowledge" inherent in vernacular buildings, from [[Wieliczka|Polish salt-caves]] to gigantic [[Syria]]n water wheels to [[Morocco|Moroccan]] desert fortresses, and was considered [[iconoclastic]] at the time.  Rudofsky was, however, very much a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment.  Rudofsky's book was also based largely on [[photographs]] and not on on-site study.

A more nuanced work is the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' edited in 1997 by [[Paul Oliver]] of the Oxford Institute for [[Sustainable Development]]. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to "ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term." [[Christopher Alexander]], in his book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. [[Howard Davis (architect)|Howard Davis]]'s book ''[[The Culture of Building]]'' details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.

Some extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the [[academic]] mainstream. The term "commercial vernacular", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of [[Robert Venturi]]'s "Learning from Las Vegas", refers to 20th-century American [[suburban]] tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an "industrial vernacular" with its emphasis on the [[aesthetics]] of [[Workshop|shops]], [[automobile repair shop|garages]] and [[factories]]. Some have linked vernacular with "off-the-shelf" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.

Among those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of [[sociology]]. In this, many were influenced by [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1984) by [[Michel de Certeau]].

==Humanitarian response==
[[File:Sutyagin house 1.JPG|thumb|"[[Sutyagin House]]", a wooden single-family house – declared illegal by the city of [[Arkhangelsk]] because of the fire hazard]]
An appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to [[disasters]] and the following construction of [[transitional shelter]] if it is needed. The work [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008030543/http://www.sheltercentre.org/shelterlibrary/publications/112.htm Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations], produced by [http://www.sheltercentre.org/ Shelter Centre] covers the use of vernacular in [[humanitarian]] response and argues its importance.

The value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6202363.stm "NGOs criticise tsunami shelters"] ''BBC News'' – 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
As many jurisdictions introduce tougher [[building code]]s and [[zoning]] regulations, "folk architects" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.

A case that made news in Russia was that of an [[Arkhangelsk]] entrepreneur Nikolay P. Sutyagin, who built what was reportedly the world's tallest single-family wooden house for himself and his family, only to see it condemned as a fire hazard. The 13-storey, {{convert|144|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} tall&lt;ref name=wan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to other sources, 12 stories, {{convert|38|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; structure, known locally as [[Sutyagin house|"Sutyagin's skyscraper"]] ([[:ru:Небоскрёб Сутягина|Небоскрёб Сутягина]]), was found to be in violation of [[Arkhangelsk]] building codes, and in 2008 the courts ordered the building to be demolished by February 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=wan&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=914 Sutyagin House, Arkhangelsk, Russia: Standing tall].

This type of building is common throughout England, Scotland and Wales, although only a few intact examples have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, P., "The Medieval Peasant Building in Scotland: The Beginning and End of Crucks", ''Ruralia IV'' 2003, pp 187–200, [https://www.academia.edu/972677/The_medieval_peasant_building_in_Scotland_the_beginning_and_end_of_crucks Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, while [[Vincent van Gogh]] was residing in [[Paris]], he executed an oil painting commonly known as '''''Wheat Field with a Lark'''''.

The center part shows a partially harvested field of wheat under a sky patterned with light clouds. A lark takes flight toward the upper left of the canvas.

The painting measures 54 x 65.5 cm (approximately 21-1/4 x 25-3/4 inches) and is housed in the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].
