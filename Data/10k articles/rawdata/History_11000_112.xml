      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">'''Alexander Colin "Alec" Campbell''' (16 April 1932 &amp;ndash; 24 November 2012) was an archaeologist and museum curator in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=260&amp;dir=2012/November/Monday26 |title=The Monitor, History legend Alec Campbell dies |publisher=Mmegi.bw |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Emeritus Director of Botswana's [[Department of Wildlife and National Parks and National Monuments (Botswana)|Department of Wildlife and National Parks and National Monuments]].

==Life==
Campbell was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].  He entered the [[British South Africa Police]] in the British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1951. Transferring to the agricultural department as a [[tsetse fly]] officer in 1954, he entered [[Rhodes University]] in 1959, graduating in [[Southern Ndebele language|SiNdebele]] and [[Social Anthropology]]. Becoming a district officer in the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] in 1962, Campbell ran the country's first house-to-house census in 1963-4. After [[Independence of Botswana|independence]] he became senior warden of Botswana's [[Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Botswana)|Department of Wildlife and National Parks]]. He founded and was later director of Botswana's [[National Museum and Art Gallery (Botswana)|National Museum and Art Gallery]]. A founder-member of the [[Botswana Society]] in 1969, he chaired the editorial board of its journal, ''Botswana Notes and Records'', for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fred|last=Morton|first2=Jeff|last2=Ramsay|first3=Part Themba|last3=Mgadla|title=Historical Dictionary of Botswana|series=African Historical Dictionaries|volume=108|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|publisher=Scarecrow Press|edition=4th|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8108-5467-3|contribution=Campbell, Alexander (Alec) Colin|pages=66–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Campbell worked to overturn the previous consensus that Botswana had little [[Stone Age]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Parsons, [http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp3.htm Botswana History Pages: Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell lived on a farm near [[Gaborone]] with his wife Judy Campbell, who also wrote on historical topics with him.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan Griswold, review of ''Botswana Notes and Records'' volume 38, [http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=7&amp;aid=23&amp;dir=2008/May/Friday9 Mmegi Online], 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  He died, aged 80, in Gaborone.

As an academic teacher, he has inspired generations of students, but his influence extends beyond the boundaries of academic life. His son is the renowned archaeologist, [[Leonardo López Luján]].

López Austin first attended law school and worked as a lawyer in his hometown. His academic association with the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM, Mexico's autonomous national university), where he was a student, spans some fifty years, and {{As of|2007|lc=yes}} he still holds a position as a researcher ([[emeritus]]) at UNAM's [[Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas]] (IIA, or Institute of Anthropological Research). López Austin lectures in the History department of UNAM's [[Faculty of Philosophy and Literature (UNAM)|Faculty of Philosophy and Literature]], the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras (FFyL).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">{{For|others called Bartholomew of Pisa, Bartholomaeus Pisanus, etc.|Bartholomew of Pisa (disambiguation)}}
{{no footnotes|date=April 2014}}

'''Bartholomew of Pisa''' ('''Bartholomew Rinonico''') was an Italian [[Franciscan]] and chronicler.

He was a Pisan of noble family. In 1352 he was a student at Bologna and later filled the office of Lector there as well as at Padua, Pisa, Sienna, and Florence. He also preached for many years with great succession different Italian cities. He died about 1401, renowned no less for sanctity than for learning, and is commemorated in the [[Franciscan Martyrology]] on 4 November.

Bartholomew's chief title to fame rests upon his remarkable book, "De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco ad Vitam Domini Nostri Jesu Christi", begun in 1385 and formally approved by the general chapter held at Assisi in 1399. Enthusiastically received on its appearance and long held in high esteem, this work became the object of bitter attacks on the part of [[Lutherans]] and [[Jansenists]]. Against it [[Erasmus Alber]] wrote the "Alcoranus Franciscanus" (Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alcoran mit einer Vorrede D. M. Luthers, 1531) in reply to which [[Henry Sedulius]], OFM, published his "Apologeticus adversus Alcoranum Franciscanorum pro libro Conformitatum" (Antwerp, 1607).

Subsequent writers on Franciscan history ignored the work; more recently it has been over-praised. Between these extreme views, the "Conformities" is a book of very uneven value. The parallels between the lives of Our Lord and St. Francis which form its basis are sometimes forced, but nowhere does it make St. Francis the equal of Christ. Side by side with fantastic legends, ridiculous visions, and other absurdities, it contains historical information. It is considered a source of great importance for Franciscan history. It was first printed at Milan in 1510 and in 1513. The new edition published at Bologna in 1590 is mutilated and corrupted, especially in the historical parts, at almost every page. A critical edition of the text was published in tom. IV of the "Analecta Franciscana" (Quaracchi, 1906).

In addition to the "Conformities", Bartholomew left some thirty other works, including an exposition of the Rule of the Friars Minor found in the "Speculum" Morin (Rouen, 1509) and a book "De Vita B. Mariae Virginis", published at Venice in 1596; his Lenten sermons were printed at Milan in 1498, Venice, 1503, and Lyons, 1519. [[Sbaralea]] and others have attributed to him the "Summa Casuum Conscientiae", which is really the work of [[Bartholomew a S. Concordio of Pisa]], O. P., and the "Vita B. Gerardi", which was written by [[Bartholomew Albisi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">[[File:Borden-System.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Index map to major Borden Blocks]]
The '''Borden System''' is an archaeological numbering system used throughout Canada and by the Canadian Museum System to track archaeological sites and the artefacts that come from them.

It was created by [[Charles Edward Borden]] with the help of [[Wilson Duff]] in 1952 at the [[University of British Columbia]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Borden |first=Charles E. |author2=Duff, Wilson |year=1952 |title=A Uniform Site Designation Scheme for Canada |journal=Anthropology in British Columbia |volume=3  |pages=44–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it Works==

AaBb-11:1234

A is the '''Major''' South-North Locator - Each block represents 2 degrees of '''Latitude''' from south to north (A - U)

a is the '''Minor''' South-North Locator - Each block represents 10 minutes of '''Latitude''' from south to north (a - l)

B is the '''Major''' East-West Locator - Each block represents 4 degrees of '''Longitude''' from east to west (A - W)

(north of 62 degrees each major block represents 8 degrees of longitude)

b is the '''Minor''' East-West Locator - Each block represents 10 minutes of '''Longitude''' from east to west (a - x)

(north of [[62nd parallel north|62 degrees]] each minor block represents 20 minutes of longitude)

Therefore, a full designation: AaBb-16 represents a roughly 16&amp;nbsp;km x 16&amp;nbsp;km area and the 16th site found within that area.

Since the number that follows is the number of the site within an area, assigned when the site is discovered, the whole number really only narrows the area to approximately a 16&amp;nbsp;km square. But it allows archaeologists to designate a site and to label every artefact from the site.

The number after the colon is the artefact number: e.g., AaBb-16:0123

Because the distance between lines of longitude get smaller with increasing latitude, the Borden System changes at [[64th parallel north|64 degrees north]] latitude, from a width of 4 degrees of longitude to a width of 8 degrees in order to keep the area within each designate roughly the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">The '''categorical test''' is a legal standard for determining whether there has been adequate provocation to reduce a [[murder]] charge to [[voluntary manslaughter]]. Traditionally, the [[mens rea]] for murder was [[malice aforethought]]. While murder and voluntary manslaughter are both [[intention (criminal law)|intentional]] [[homicide]]s, adequate [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] mitigates a defendant's culpability. Adequate provocation is a legal requirement for a murder charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. The test for adequate provocation varies across jurisdictions and has changed over time. The categorical approach is based on [[common law]] principles, but most courts today apply less restrictive tests, such as the extreme emotional disturbance test in [[Model Penal Code]] jurisdictions.

==Historical background==
The formal distinction between manslaughter and murder begins to emerge in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Taylor |first=Laurie J. |title=Provoked Reason in Men and Women: Heat-of-Passion Manslaughter and Imperfect Self-Defense|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/PL?key=CQCZv|year=1986| volume=33|journal=UCLA L. Rev.|page=1679}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1550s, cases appear in [[Law report|law reports]] that begin to develop the [[jurisprudence]] of manslaughter. Provocation began to replace the earlier "hotbloodedness" when a landmark case from 1600 established that insults and rude gestures were not sufficient provocation to reduce a murder charge to manslaughter. After this case, judges began developed four common law "categories" of provocation:&lt;ref&gt;Kesselring, K.(2016-05-12). ‘Murder’s Crimson Badge’: Homicide in the Age of Shakespeare. In The Oxford Handbook of the Age of Shakespeare. : Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#seeing a friend or family member attacked (1612)
#insulting physical attacks like boxing the ears (early 17th century)
#seeing an English person unlawfully deprived of liberty (1666)
#seeing another man committing adultery with one's wife

The '''Council of University Classical Departments''' (CUCD), founded in 1969, is the association of university departments in the United Kingdom in which Classics (the study of Greek and Roman antiquity) and related subjects are taught and researched.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/cucd/&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is one of the principal voices of Classics in the UK (alongside others such as the [[Classical Association]], the [[Joint Association of Classical Teachers]], and Friends of Classics), and the only one with a distinctive focus on Higher Education.

The Council is composed of a Representative of each member institution (there are currently 29), and normally meets once a year in November in London.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/cucd/#About for Council minutes since 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Standing Committee, with a membership of around 18, normally meets three times a year in London.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/cucd/#About for Standing Committee minutes since 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council has published an annual ''Bulletin'' since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/cucd/bulletin.html for the text of the ''Bulletins'' since 1995; and http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/cucd/contents.html for an index of contents up to 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years CUCD has been increasingly active in defending and advancing the position of Classics in the UK. On 17 March 2005 the Council, together with Friends of Classics, hosted a reception for parliamentarians and others in the Palace of Westminster, to promote the cause of classical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''CUCD Bulletin'', 34 (2005), 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; CUCD maintains strong links with other Arts, Humanities, and Law subject associations, as well as with the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Classics. The present chair, [[Robin Osborne]], has more than once spoken for the concerns of Humanities subjects in general.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''The Times Higher'', 19 Mar. 2008 (http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=401166).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emily''' or '''Emma Sadka''' (1920 – 19 July 1968) was an Iraqi-Singaporean historian and researcher specialising in the Political History of the Malayan region, which she taught at the University of Malaya (Singapore) and in Australian universities.&lt;ref name="Silcock1963"&gt;Silcock, Thomas H., and E. K. Fisk. The Political Economy of Independent Malaya; a Case-study in Development. Berkeley: U of California, 1963: xi. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Sadka was the eldest daughter of Sassoon Samuel Sadka and his wife, Sarah, Jews originating from Baghdad.&lt;ref name="JASReview1970"&gt;"Review. The Protected Malay States: 1874-1895." ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' Vol 30 No. 1 (Nov.) (1970): 237. JSTOR. JSTOR. Web. 27 Apr. 2015. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2942796&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the grandniece of Moshe Sadka, the Chief Rabbi of Baghdad,&lt;ref&gt;"Queen gives honor to Chief Rabbi's Kin." ''The Jewish Transcript'' [[Seattle, Washington]] 11 March 1938:  8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cousin of Singapore Chief Minister, [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Kevin. ''Marshall of Singapore: A Biography''. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2008: 293. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied at the Raffles' Girls' School from 1928 to 1935, then joined the special Scholarship Class at Raffles Institute, in 1935, at the age of 16. She was underage for the examination at that time and sat again the following year. In December 1937, it was announced that she had won the British Malayan Queen's Scholarship that provided pass to and back from England, together with the cost of education at Oxford, Cambridge, or any other university, for up to four years.  She had been the first Jewish woman to have won this scholarship. Other winners were [[Lim Chong Eu]] (18) of the Penang Free School who would go on to become Chief Minister of Penang, Chin Kim Hong (19) of the King Edward VIII School in Taiping and Mohamed Ismail bin Mohamed Ali (19) of Victoria Institution in Selangor.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Sadka S.S.

Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia, Government of Australia., n.d. Web. 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She read modern history at [[St. Hilda's College, Oxford]] where she obtained a B.A. (First Class Hons.) in History in 1941.&lt;ref name="JASReview1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFP1947"&gt;"S'pore Girl Studies Soviet System." ''The Singapore Free Press'' 10 September 1947: 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

She learnt Russian and the Scandinavian languages and in 1942, won a Carnegie Grant to carry out research in Soviet Administration in the former Czarist colonies of Central Asia. In 1946 she had attended the London County Council evening classes in literature and current events and gave a series of talks on the Soviet Union for the Marylebone Literary Institute. She had also served on the committee of the International Youth Centre in London. By September 1947, she was in Australia on break, her work on the subject was nearing completion, and she was planning the presentation of her Ph.D. thesis to take place in England in 1948.&lt;ref name="SFP1947"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== University of Malaya ===

She joined the [[National University of Singapore|University of Malaya]] as Assistant Lecturer in August 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"University, gets 13 new teachers." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 21 August 1951: 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1953, she was elected Secretary of the Malayan Historical Society (Singapore) under Professor [[C. Northcote Parkinson|Cyril Northcote Parkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;"New historical society chiefs." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 23 June 1953: 7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sieveking Expedition ===
In August 1953, the only woman in the team, Sadka, having resigned, left on an expedition headed by Acting Director of Museums Dr. G. de G. Sieveking, to investigate the ancient settlement of Kota Batu, a site at Johore Lama, up the Johore River, and probe the remains of two boats embedded in the river's banks.&lt;ref&gt;"Seven sail to probe mystery of 'Kota Batu.' Woman will help dig among ruins." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 11 August 1953: 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces of 17th to 18th century Chinese pottery were found among the remains of one of the boats. A local in the area showed them a bowl of Siamese origin that had been found filled with gold coins. According to that owner the coins were subsequently melted down and the gold, sold.&lt;ref&gt;"Digging Up History – 300-year-old Fort Found in Johore Lama." The Straits Times [Singapore] 16 August 1953: 11. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Sadka and Sieveking, the expedition also comprised Dr. Paul Wheatley of the University of Malaya, Dr. C. A. Gibson-Hill of the Raffles Museum, Tony Beamish of Radio Malaya, M. W. F Tweedie of the Singapore Museum, Oswald Theseira of the F.M.S. Museum, Naval Commander-in-Chief (Far East Station) Vice Admiral Sir Charles Lambe, John Senior of the British Army, Wong Lin Ken, Clement Hon, Wang Gung Wu.&lt;ref&gt;"Digging up history." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore], 16 August 1953: 11. Print; "Ming from the river's mud." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 19 August 1953: 10. Print; "A short-lived kingdom disappears." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 9 September 1953: 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavation made an important find. This was the first time that the use of masonry in Malay fortifications had been recorded. Of equal importance, the expedition's surveys allowed for more accurate orientation of the internal geography of that settlement. The remains of an ancient Chinese trading ship were also a result of the excavations there.&lt;ref&gt;"Secrets of an old fort bared." ''The Straits Times'' [Singapore] 10 September 1953: 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Australian University  ===
Sadka was awarded a research scholarship at the [[National Australian University]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="SFP1957"&gt;"Singapore history." ''The Singapore Free Press'' [Singapore] 8 April 1957: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journal of Sir Hugh Low ===
Sadka believed that [[Hugh Low]], third British resident at [[Perak]], was "one of the greatest of Malaya's administrators," but noted that  he had been neglected by writers of Malayan history, with only passing references made in the notes made by Swettenham and Winstedt. At that time his private papers could not be located and much of Perak's official records, and those of the Colonial Secretary's Office in Singapore had been destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Malaya. The only thing, remaining at that time was the first volume of his handwritten journals, at that time kept at the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur [and now kept at the National Archives of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur], that spanned his first eight weeks in Perak (19 April to 15 June 1877). Sadka worked on deciphering, and transcribing and correcting the text of this manuscript. It was published, two years later, in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Sadka, Emily, ed. ''The Journal of Sir Hugh Low, Perak, 1877''. [''JMBRAS'' vol. 27. pt. 4.] Singapore 1955: 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malayan historical materials in Australia ===
While carrying out research at the Australian National University, Sadka discovered that there was enough material in Canberra for students to use as a sound basis of Malayan history. She was, at that time, preparing a thesis on ''The Residential System of Government in the States of Malaya from 1874 to 1895''.&lt;ref name="SFP1957"/&gt;

=== Victoria University (N.Z.) ===
Sadka then proceeded to New Zealand where she taught at the [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. Sadka's undergraduate class in Southeast Asian history was considered innovative for 1958 New Zealand. Historian Anthony John Stanhope Reid, who had not previously studied history at school, became interested while at the University. He thereafter obtained a B.Econs. in Economics and History (1960) and M.Hist. (1961).&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Geoff, and Tana Li, eds. ''Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian past''. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2012: 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian National University ===
Having taught there a while, Sadka left New Zealand for Australia and went to Canberra as one of the Australian National University's earliest doctoral candidates. Her thesis, was later revised and published as "The Protected Malay States 1874-1875." She completed her degree in 1966&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Geoff, and Tana Li, eds. ''Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian past''. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2012: 14-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Karina. "Authority Records: Sadka, Emily." ANU | Archives Collection. Australian National University, 24 Oct. 2012. Web. 27 Apr. 2015. &lt;http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/sadka-emily&gt;. ANU Library catalogue http://anulib.anu.edu.au/ (accessed 24 Oct 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final work ===
Emily Sadka died on 19 July 1968 in [[Perth]], Western Australia,&lt;ref&gt;"Deaths." The Straits Times [Singapore] 20 July 1968: 16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; the same year her revised thesis in book form, "The Protected Malay States, 1874-1895," was published.&lt;ref&gt;Sadka, Emily. The Protected Malay States, 1874-1895. Kuala Lumpur: U of Malaya, 1968. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

She had been one of the first students at the Australian National University where she worked on the settlement of north-west Western Australia. Three boxes of her handwritten drafts and extracts from various journals are kept at the National Library of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/686043 "Sadka, Emily: Papers, 1940-1958" (manuscript)] | National Library of Australia.

'''Enrique''' (or '''Henrique''') '''Flórez de Setién y Huidobro''' (July 21, 1702 – August 20, 1773) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] historian.

==Biography==
Flórez was born in [[Villadiego]]. At 15 years old, he entered the order of [[Augustinians|St Augustine]]. He subsequently became professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Alcala]], where he published a ''Cursus theologiae'' in five volumes (1732–1738). He then devoted himself to historical studies. Of these the first-fruit was his ''Clavis Historiae'', a work of the same class as the French ''Art de verifier les dates'', and preceding it by several years. It appeared in 1743, and passed through many editions. 

In 1747 was published the first volume of ''España Sagrada, teatro geografico-historico de La Iglesia de España'', a vast compilation of Spanish ecclesiastical history which obtained a European reputation, and of which twenty-nine volumes appeared in the author's lifetime. It was continued after his death by [[Manuel Risco]] and others, and further additions have been made at the expense of the Spanish government. The whole work in fifty-one volumes was published at Madrid (1747–1886). Its value is considerably increased by the insertion of ancient chronicles and documents not easily accessible elsewhere. 

Flórez was a good [[numismatist]], and published ''Medallas de Las Colonias'' in 2 vols. (1757–1758), of which a third volume appeared in 1773. His last work was the ''Memorias de las reynas Catolicas'', 2 vols. (1770). Flórez led a retired, studious and unambitious life, and died at Madrid.

[[File:Mostwantedterrorbanner.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Banner used by the FBI since inception on October 10, 2001 as the main title for the web site pages of both the group of wanted terrorists, and also on the [[wanted poster]] of each [[terrorist]] fugitive. The three overlapping seals on the left are the seal of the [[U.S. Department of State]] (similar to the [[Great Seal of the United States]]) and the seal of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] while on the right is the seal of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]]]

The '''FBI Most Wanted Terrorists''' was a list created and first released on October 10, 2001, with the authority of [[United States President]] Bush, following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]]. Initially, the list contained 22 of the top terrorists chosen by the [[FBI]], all of whom had earlier been indicted for acts of terrorism between 1985 and 1998. None of the 22 had been captured by US or other authorities by that date. Of the 22, only [[Osama bin Laden]] was by then already listed on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.

No particular legal consequences flowed from the creation of and inclusion on the list. On January 17, 2002, the FBI released a third major FBI wanted list, which has now become known as the [[FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list]], to enlist the public's help in reporting information which may prevent future terrorist attacks. The information sought to be reported is not necessarily relating to any person on any of the FBI wanted lists.

==Initial persons alleged to be terrorist fugitives==
On the fugitive group wanted poster, the FBI did not list the persons in any particular stated order, except perhaps for the consistent placing of bin Laden in the number one position of the top row. However, the 22 can easily fit into distinct categories of over the two decades, based on the [[terrorist attacks]] in which they were, according to US authorities, involved. 

For organization and ease of reference here, the relevant major terrorist attacks are listed by date below, with a brief summary for each, identifying the terror cells most directly responsible for the attack. The 22 on the list are then grouped beneath the attack for which each person was first accused of involvement.&lt;ref name="List Released"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |title=Most wanted terrorists list released |date=October 1, 2001 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714134800/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |archivedate=July 14, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list==
Whereas the Most Wanted Terrorists list is reserved for terrorist fugitives who have been indicted by federal grand juries, the FBI recognized a further need to achieve a much quicker response time in order to prevent any future attacks which may be in the current planning stages. To enlist the public's help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the [[FBI Seeking Information – Terrorism list]].

As the name of this list implies, the FBI's intent is to acquire any critical information from the public, as soon as possible, about the suspected terrorists, who may be in the planning stages of terror attacks against United States nationals at home and abroad. The first such list profiled five persons about whom little was known, but who were suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in [[martyr]]dom operations. The main evidence against the five was five videos they had produced, found in the rubble of [[Mohammed Atef]]'s destroyed home outside [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], Afghanistan.

==Additions to the list==
By 2006, more than four years had passed since the FBI had listed the original 22 alleged terrorists on the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Of those 22, by then four had been qualified for removal from the list, due to death or capture. Also by then, the FBI determined that new persons qualified to be listed as Most Wanted Terrorists. Some of these persons were indicted for attacks and plots that had taken place since the original list had been compiled. The original indictments had been for incidents only through 1998. Since then, the U.S. had become victim to at least two major terror attacks, which would generate some of the new indictments for the Most Wanted Terrorists, notably:

* [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded 40 on October 12, 2000, off the port coast of [[Aden, Yemen]]
* [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in [[Manhattan]], [[Washington D.C.]], and [[Pennsylvania]]

In addition, after the original 2001 list had been compiled and released to the public, the U.S. had foiled and issued indictments for numerous other plots, involving some new listed Most Wanted Terrorists. Those notable other plots involved:&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mwtl_yemen022306.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411074732/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mwtl_yemen022306.htm|archivedate=April 11, 2010|title=Recent Escapees From Yemen Prison Added to Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information - War on Terrorism Lists|date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=August 14, 2012|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Buffalo Six]], a [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York cell, or Lackawanna Cell, exposed September 2002
* [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) charges for plots based from [[Syria]] since 1995
* [[Abu Sayyaf]] kidnappings and murders of foreign nationals in the [[Philippines]]
In February 2006, the FBI completed two groups of additions to the Most Wanted Terrorists list, the first such additions in over four years. On February 24, 2006, the day after adding two name to the list, the FBI added an additional six fugitive terrorists, for various plots and attacks. One of the entries was for an indictment dating back to the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847 by Hezbollah (see above).

Additionally, the FBI also added to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list an additional three persons, most notably, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the notorious leader of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]].&lt;ref name="24threlease"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm|title=FBI Updates Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information – War on Terrorism Lists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830144046/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm|archivedate=August 30, 2010|accessdate=January 3, 2012|date=February 24, 2010|publisher=FBI.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time that al-Zarqawi had appeared on any of the three major FBI wanted lists. On June 8, 2006, [[ABC News]] reported that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was confirmed to have been killed in Baghdad in a bombing raid by a United States task force. His death was confirmed by multiple sources in Iraq, including the United States government.

==Rewards==
Since 1984, the United States government has also used the [[Rewards for Justice Program]], which pays monetary rewards of up to $5 million, or now, in some cases more, upon special authorization by the [[United States Secretary of State]], to individuals who provide information which substantially leads to countering of terrorist attacks against United States persons. More than $100 million had been paid to over 60 people through this program.&lt;ref name="RFJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=Rewards_program&amp;language=english |title=Rewards for Justice: Program Overview |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |publisher=Rewards for Justice |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516130328/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=Rewards_program&amp;language=english |archivedate=May 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rewards for Justice Program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98-533, and is administered by the [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]], within the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref name="RFJ"/&gt;

{{accounting}}
A '''fiscal year''' (or '''financial year''', or sometimes '''budget year''') is the period used by governments for accounting and budget purposes, which varies between countries. It is also used for [[financial report]]ing by business and other organizations. Laws in many [[jurisdiction]]s require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis, but generally do ''not'' require the reporting period to align with the [[calendar year]] (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for [[direct tax]]ation, such as income tax. Many annual government fees—such as Council rates, licence fees, etc.—are also levied on a fiscal year basis, while others are charged on an [[anniversary]] basis.

The "fiscal year end" (FYE) is the date that marks the end of the fiscal year. Some companies—such as [[Cisco Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cisco Profit For Quarter Slightly Beats Estimates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/business/cisco-profit-for-quarter-slightly-beats-estimates.html|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 May 2004|author=MATT RICHTEL|agency=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;—end their fiscal year on the same day of the week each year, e.g. the day that is closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December). Under such a system, some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks.

The calendar year is used as the fiscal year by about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FT UK 500 2011|url=http://media.ft.com/cms/35094546-98d4-11e0-bd66-00144feab49a.pdf|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=31 March 2011|author=Thomson ONE Banker, Thomson Reuters Datastream and individual companies|agency=The Financial Times Ltd|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere, with notable exceptions being in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions|url=http://www.anzccj.jp/UserFiles/File/ANZCCJ%20Constitution%20April%202011.pdf|work=Australian and New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Japan Constitution|publisher=Australian and New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Japan|accessdate=14 August 2012|author=Australian and New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Japan|format=PDF|date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer to align the fiscal year with the [[academic year]] (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year), and because the university is normally less busy during the summer months. In the northern hemisphere this is July to the next June. In the southern hemisphere this is calendar year, January to December. Some media/communication-based organizations use a [[broadcast calendar]] as the basis for their fiscal year.

The fiscal year is usually denoted by the year in which it ends, so United States federal government spending incurred on 14 November {{CURRENTYEAR}} would belong to fiscal year {{NEXTYEAR}}, operating on a fiscal calendar of October–September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of fiscal year investopedia.com|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax year==
The fiscal year for individuals and entities to report and pay income taxes is often known as the taxpayer's tax year or taxable year.  Taxpayers in many jurisdictions may choose their tax year.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p538.pdf U.S. IRS Publication 538].&lt;/ref&gt; Some federal countries, such as Canada and Switzerland, require the provincial or cantonal tax year to align with the federal year. In the United States, most states retained a June 30 fiscal year-end date when the federal government switched to September 30 in 1976. Nearly all jurisdictions require that the tax year be 12 months or 52/53 weeks.&lt;ref name="USC441"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/441-|title=26 U.S. Code § 441 - Period for computation of taxable income|work=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, short years are permitted as the first year or when changing tax years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/443- 26 USC 443].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries require all individuals to pay income tax based on the calendar year.  Significant exceptions include:
* Australia: individuals pay income tax based on the financial year of 1 July until 30 June.&lt;ref name="ASIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing a financial year |url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/Changing+a+financial+year?openDocument|accessdate=9 July 2014|author=ASIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*United Kingdom: individuals pay tax on a year ending 5 April. This is due to Britain historically having a calendar year starting on [[Quarter_days#In_England|Lady Day]] (25 March) in the [[Julian calendar]], which translates to 6 April in the [[Gregorian calendar]].
*United States: individuals may (but rarely do) elect any tax year, subject to IRS approval.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1128.pdf instructions] to [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1128.pdf IRS Form 1128] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_E_40_I.html 26 USC 441–444].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions require that the tax year conform to the taxpayer's fiscal year for financial reporting. The United States is a notable exception: taxpayers may choose any tax year, but must keep books and records for such year.&lt;ref name="USC441"/&gt;

==Operation in various countries/region==
In some jurisdictions, particularly those that permit [[tax consolidation]], companies that are part of a [[Business group|group]] of businesses must use nearly the same fiscal year (differences of up to three months are permitted in some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and Japan), with consolidating entries to adjust for transactions between units with different fiscal years, so the same resources will not be counted more than once or not at all.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan, the fiscal year was recently{{clarify timeframe|date=February 2017}} changed from 1 Hamal – 29 Hoot (21 March – 20 March) to 1 Jadi – 30 Qaus (21 December – 20 December). The fiscal year runs with the Afghan or [[Solar Hijri calendar]], because of the differing cycle of leap years in the Gregorian and Afghan calendars, there can be slight differences in the start date of fiscal (and calendar) years. As shown in the chart below, leap years will coincide in 2020 and 2024 but will desynchronize with the Gregorian calendar having a leap year in 2028 as opposed to the Afghan calendar's leap year of 2029.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], a fiscal year is commonly called a "financial year" (FY) and starts on 1 July and ends on the next 30 June. Financial years are designated by the calendar year of the second half of the period. For example, financial year 2017 is the 12-month period ending on 30 June 2017 and can be referred to as FY2016/17. It is used for official purposes, by individual taxpayers and by the overwhelming majority of business enterprises.&lt;ref name="ASIC"/&gt; Business enterprises may opt to use a financial year that ends at the end of a week (e.g., 52 or 53 weeks in length, and therefore is not exactly one calendar year in length), or opt for its financial year to end on a date that matches the reporting cycle of its foreign parent. All entities within the one group must use the same financial year.

For government accounting and budget purposes, pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] colonies changed the financial year from the calendar year to a year ending 30 June on the following dates: Victoria changed in 1870, South Australia in 1874, Queensland in 1875, Western Australia in 1892, New South Wales in 1895 and Tasmania in 1904. The Commonwealth adopted the near-ubiquitous financial year standard since its inception in 1901.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be1JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=when+did+australia+adopt+the+financial+year+ending+in+June&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QS6PJKmABz&amp;sig=8OImKmJFtIMJleY5K582cLzrS_I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizz4al6J3RAhVGJJQKHb8CAPE4ChDoAQg_MAc#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20did%20australia%20adopt%20the%20financial%20year%20ending%20in%20June&amp;f=false |title=Accounting in Australia (RLE Accounting): Historical Essays |page=63 |author=Robert H. Parker |year=2013 |isbn=9781317963929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given for the change was for convenience, as Parliament typically sits during May and June, while it was difficult for it to meet in November and December to pass a budget.&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt;

The Financial year is split into the following four quarters &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Business-activity-statements-(BAS)/In-detail/Activity-statement-generate-dates/|title=Activity statement generate dates|last=Office|first=Australian Taxation|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of assessment for individuals covers twelve months, 1 March to the final day of February the following year. The Act also provides for certain classes of taxpayers to have a year of assessment ending on a day other than the last day of February. Companies are permitted to have a tax year ending on a date that coincides with their financial year. Many older companies still use a tax year that runs from 1 July to 30 June, inherited from the British system. A common practice for newer companies is to run their tax year from 1 March to the final day of February following, to synchronize with the tax year for individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Although [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] is charged by reference to the government's financial year, companies can adopt any year as their accounting year: if there is a change in tax rate, the taxable profit is apportioned to financial years on a time basis.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A number of major corporations that were once government-owned, such as [[BT Group]] and the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], continue to use the government's financial year, which ends on the last day of March, as they have found no reason to change since [[privatisation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
	
The 5 April year end for personal tax and benefits reflects the old [[ecclesiastical calendar]], with New Year falling on 25 March (''[[Lady Day]]''), the difference being accounted for by the eleven days "missed out" when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] converted from the [[Julian Calendar]] to the [[Gregorian Calendar]] in September 1752 (the British tax authorities, and landlords were unwilling to lose 11 days of tax and rent revenue, so under provision 6 (''Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities, &amp;c.'') of the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], the 1752–3 tax year was extended by 11 days). From 1753 until 1799, the tax year in Great Britain began on 5 April, which was the "[[Old Style and New Style dates|old style]]" new year of 25 March. A 12th skipped Julian leap day in 1800 changed its start to 6 April. It was not changed when a 13th Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the start of the personal tax year in the United Kingdom is still 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Key Dates for UK Tax Year 2015/2016|url = https://www.taxback.com/blog/key-dates-for-uk-tax-year|website = www.taxback.com|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Pat |year=2008 |title=Tax Answers at A Glance 08 09 |edition=illustrated |publisher=Lawpack Publishing Ltd|isbn=1-905261-81-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9bbsIhsjdLQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steel |first=Duncan |year=2000 |title=Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar|edition=illustrated |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-29827-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L17tRoOR6tQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Federal government====
The United States federal government's fiscal year is the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 the following year. The identification of a fiscal year is the calendar year in which it ends; thus, the current fiscal year is {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}, often written as "FY{{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}" or "FY{{#time:y|+3 months - 4 hours}}", which began on 1 October {{#time:Y|-9 months - 4 hours}} and will end on 30 September {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}.

Prior to 1976, the fiscal year began on 1 July and ended on 30 June. The [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] made the change to allow Congress more time to arrive at a budget each year, and provided for what is known as the "transitional quarter" from 1 July 1976 to 30 September 1976. An earlier shift in the federal government's fiscal year was made in 1843, shifting the fiscal year from a calendar year to one starting on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Statutes at Large and Treaties of the United States of America, Volume 5|year=1856|publisher=Charles C. Little &amp; James Brown|location=Boston|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] fiscal year for {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}} is:

* 1st quarter: 1 October {{#time:Y|-9 months - 4 hours}} – 31 December {{#time:Y|-9 months - 4 hours}}
* 2nd quarter: 1 January {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}} – 31 March {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}
* 3rd quarter: 1 April {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}} – 30 June {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}
* 4th quarter: 1 July {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}} – 30 September {{#time:Y|+3 months - 4 hours}}

====State governments====
State governments set their own fiscal year. Forty-six of the fifty states set their fiscal year to end on June 30.&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/basic-information-about-which-states-have-major-ta.aspx#fyrs |title=Basic Information About Which States Have Major Taxes and States' Fiscal Years |date=July 13, 2012 |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four states have fiscal years that end on a different date:

* [[Alabama]], ends September 30
* [[Michigan]], ends September 30
* [[New York (state)|New York]], ends March 31
* [[Texas]], ends August 31

The fiscal year for the [[Washington, D.C.]] government ends on September 30.&lt;ref name=DC_Code&gt;{{cite web |title=Code of the District of Columbia, Title 1. Government Organization § 1–204.41. Fiscal year. |url=https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.41.html |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |publisher=Council of the District of Columbia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the inhabited [[territories of the United States]], most align with the federal fiscal year, ending on September 30. These include [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; [[Puerto Rico]] is the exception, with its fiscal year ending on June 30.

====Businesses and organizations====
The tax year for a business is governed by the fiscal year it chooses.  A business may choose any consistent fiscal year that it wants; however, for seasonal businesses such as farming and retail, a good account practice is to end the fiscal year shortly after the highest revenue time of year.  Consequently, most large agriculture companies end their fiscal years after the harvest season, and most retailers end their fiscal years shortly after the Christmas shopping season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3777">'''François-Xavier Wurth-Paquet''' (16 April 1801 – 4 February 1885) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian politician, [[jurist]], and [[archaeologist]].

Born in [[Luxembourg City]], he studied law in [[Liège]] and then became a lawyer, judge, prosecutor and in 1848 president of the Superior Court.

From 1845 to 1848 he was a member of the [[Assembly of Estates]]. He was elected to represent the [[Esch-sur-Alzette (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|canton of Esch-sur-Alzette]] on the [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]], in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}/{{de icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1848/0038/a038.pdf#page=3 | title=Mémorial A, 1848, No. 38 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | format=PDF | publisher=Service central de législation }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Orangism (Luxembourg)|Orangist]], he served in the cabinet of [[Charles-Mathias Simons]] as [[Minister for Justice of Luxembourg|Administrator-General for Justice]] from 1853 to 1856, and as Administrator-General for the Interior from 1856 to 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Thewes, Guy. [http://www.gouvernement.lu/1828371/Gouvernements_depuis_1848-version_2011.pdf "Les gouvernements du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg depuis 1848"]. Service information et presse du gouvernment. Luxembourg: Imprimerie Centrale, 2011. p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; He later was a member of the [[Council of State of Luxembourg|Council of State]] from 6 October 1858 to 4 February 1885, and was its [[President of the Council of State of Luxembourg|President]] from 1870 until 1871.

Wurth-Pacquet was the founding President of Luxembourg's Archaeological Association, the forerunner of the Historical Section of the [[Grand Ducal Institute]]. He held that office from 1845 until 1853, when he entered government, and again from 1876 until his death in 1885.

In the publications of this institution, he made inventories of old Luxembougish documents, also publishing extracts. He managed to examine 18,000 documents, and also copies of 60,000 documents from abroad. He granted this collection to the Institute after his death. He also helped established what has now become the [[National Museum of History and Art]].

He died in 1885 in Luxembourg City.

Wurth-Pacquet's daughter was Hélène Wurth, who married into the [[Brasseur family]].  Her husband, [[Pierre Brasseur (Luxembourg)|Pierre Brasseur]], was a mining magnate that founded the company that would later become [[ARBED]].  The couple in turn had five children, including politician [[Xavier Brasseur]].

== History ==
French scholar Alexis Pichard has argued that TV series enjoyed a Second Golden Age in the early 1990s which was a combination of three elements: first, an improvement in both visual aesthetics and storytelling; second, an overall homogeneity between cable series and networks series; and third, a tremendous popular success. Alexis Pichard contends that this Second Golden Age was the result of a revolution initiated by the traditional networks in the 1980s and carried on by the cable channels (especially HBO) in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pichard, 2011, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Shows such as ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (which first aired in 1999), ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' (2001), ''[[The Wire]]'' (2002), ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (2004), ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2007), ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (2008) and ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' (2011), are generally considered the basis of the so-called Golden Age of Television, i.e. the new creator-driven tragic dramas of the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name="reese" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kakutani|first1=Michiko|title=Brett Martin’s ‘Difficult Men’ Sees a New Golden Age for TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/books/brett-martins-difficult-men-sees-a-new-golden-age-for-tv.html|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plunkett|first1=John|last2=Deans|first2=Jason|title=Kevin Spacey: television has entered a new golden age|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/22/kevin-spacey-tv-golden-age|accessdate=2 January 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Writer's Guild of America vote for 101 Best Written TV Shows includes a complete foundation of the current Golden Age of Television. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4925|title=101 Best Written TV Series List|work=wga.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Zacharek of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' has argued that the current golden age began earlier with network shows like ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (both of which premiered in 1993), and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Buffy"&gt;Zacharek, Stephanie (2015).

''[[The Village Voice]]''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082521/http://www.villagevoice.com/2015-04-29/film/why-avengers-age-of-ultron-fills-this-buffy-fan-with-despair/2/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' has said that ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005) should be considered a part of the golden age of television, and recommended "the sophisticated kids show" to others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotaku.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-one-of-the-great-tv-shows-1787285748 kotaku.com]&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of instant access to content on [[Netflix]], creator-driven television shows like ''Breaking Bad'', ''[[The Shield]]'' (2002), ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' (2006) and ''Mad Men'' gained cult followings that grew to become widely popular. The success of instant access to television shows was presaged by the popularity of DVDs, and continues to increase with the rise of digital platforms and online companies.

The increase in the number of shows is also cited as evidence of a Golden Age. In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the number of scripted television shows, on broadcast, cable and digital platforms increased by 71%. In 2002, 182 television shows aired, while 2016 saw 455 original scripted television shows with an additional increase projected for 2017. The number of shows are rising largely due to companies like [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]] and [[Hulu]] investing heavily in original content. The number of shows aired by online service increased from only one in 2009 to over 93 in 2016. [[John Landgraf]], the CEO of [[FX (TV channel)|FX Networks]], has stated that the United States has reached "peak television", where the amount of television series being aired could be overwhelming for the viewer to choose from, especially for critics obligated to review as many shows as possible, which results in a decreased output of television series in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|title='Peak TV in America': Is there really too much good scripted television?|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/peak-tv-in-america-is-there-really-too-much-good-scripted-television|accessdate=2 January 2016|work=[[HitFix]]|publisher=HitFix, Inc.|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Meg|title=2015: Year of 'peak TV' hits record with 409 original series|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-2015-peak-tv-new-record-409-original-series-20151216-story.html|accessdate=2 January 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Peak TV: Surge From Streaming Services, Cable Pushes 2015 Scripted Series Tally to 409|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/peak-tv-409-original-series-streaming-cable-1201663212/|accessdate=2 January 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/68309b3a-1f02-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9|title=Watch it while it lasts: our golden age of television|last=Leslie|first=Ian|date=2017-04-13|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peak-tv-still-going-strong-with-455-scripted-shows-in-2016-1482350706|title=Peak TV Still Going Strong With 455 Scripted Shows in 2016|last=Flint|first=Joe|date=2016-12-21|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Albert Alexander Louis Carl Stuhlmacher''' (1892–1962) was a German [[pedagogue]], [[Wehrmacht]] officer and [[local historian]].

== Life and works ==

Hans Stuhlmacher was born on 16 May 1892 in Lüneburg, the son of a district court chancery clerk (''Landgerichtskanzlist''), Friedrich Stuhlmacher, and his wife, Emma, née Ebbeke. On 11 November 1915 he married Margarethe Klinkhardt, by whom he had a son, Hans Georg.

At the end of 1940 Hans Stuhlmacher was called up for Wehrmacht service for the second time. In late 1943 he reached the rank of [[major]]. For many years Stuhlmacher was [[headmaster]] of the [[grammar school|senior boy's grammar school]] in Walsrode and district local history [[curator]] of the old district of [[Landkreis Fallingbostel|Fallingbostel]]. He died in Walsrode on 26 February 1962, shortly before the publication of his book, the ''Geschichte der Stadt Walsrode'' ("History of the Town of Walsrode") in September that year.

'''Hector Boece''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|s}}; also spelled '''Boyce''' or '''Boise'''; 1465–1536), known in Latin as '''Hector Boecius''' or '''Boethius''', was a Scottish philosopher and historian, and the first [[Ancient university governance in Scotland|Principal]] of [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in Aberdeen, a predecessor of the [[University of Aberdeen]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Dundee]] where he attended school and was educated at the nearby [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Scottish philosophers who helped shape the world|url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/five-scottish-philosophers-who-helped-shape-the-world-1-4097069|publisher=The Scotsman|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he left to study at the [[University of Paris]] where he met [[Erasmus]], with whom he became close friends while they were both students at the austere [[Collège de Montaigu]], to whose reforming Master, [[Jan Standonck]], Boece later became Secretary. By 1497 he had become a professor of philosophy at Collège de Montaigu.

In 1500, he was induced to leave Paris for [[Aberdeen]] by a generously financed offer to become the first principal of the newly established [[University of Aberdeen]], created at the behest of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] by [[William Elphinstone]], Bishop of Aberdeen under the authority of a [[Papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Alexander VI]].

From then onwards, he worked closely with Elphinstone, to set up the new university and by 1505, regular lectures were taking place at King's College. The university structure was modelled on those of Paris and of [[Orléans]]. As intended, Boece was installed as the first principal of the university and gave lectures on medicine and on divinity.

At the end of 1534, Boece became Rector of [[Fyvie]]. He died in Aberdeen two years later at the age of 71.

==Works==
Boece wrote and published two books, one of biography and one of history. In 1522 he published the ''Vitae Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium'' ''(Lives of the Bishops of Murthlack and Aberdeen'') and in 1527 the ''Historia Gentis Scotorum'' (''History of the Scottish People'') to the accession of [[James III of Scotland]]. The former was the basis of a poem in [[Scots language|Scots]] by [[Alexander Gardyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=10380|title=Garden, Alexander|first=J. Derrick|last=McClure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Reception of the ''Historia''
The ''Historia'' is the work for which Boece is remembered, as the second scholarly history of the Scots to be written; its only real predecessor was the compendium of [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]]. It was written in a flowing and pleasing style, became popular, and led to ecclesiastical preferment and royal favour. By modern standards it is overly patriotic, and has many inaccuracies. The historical account of [[Macbeth of Scotland]], in particular, flattered the antecedents of Boece's patron King [[James IV of Scotland]], and greatly maligned the real Macbeth. The work was well received at the time, both in Europe and in Scotland, after its translation from [[Latin]] into French and then in 1536 from Latin into Scots by [[John Bellenden]] (which is the oldest book of prose written in Scots to survive into modern times). There are some glimpses in the ''Historia'' of contemporary Scotland, such as the statement that the [[Eurasian beaver]], which was soon to become extinct in Scotland, was still common around [[Loch Ness]].

;Continuations of the ''Historia'' and its influence
Boece's ''Historia'' as published terminated in 1438. In the early 1530s the scholar Giovanni Ferrerio, engaged by [[Robert Reid (bishop)|Robert Reid]] of [[Kinloss Abbey]], wrote a continuation of Boece's history, extending it another 50 years, to the end of the reign of James III. [[John Lesley]] in his ''De Origine, Moribus, et Rebus Gestis Scotorum'', and [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]], provided further continuations. The metrical translation into Scots by [[William Stewart (makar)|William Stewart]], not published until the nineteenth century, also provided some expansion.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=2760|title=Boece, Hector|first=Nicola|last=Royan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Barclay Turnbull|Turnbull, William B.]], ed., ''The Buik of the Chroniclis of Scotland; a metrical version of the History of Hector Boece by [[William Stewart (makar)|William Stewart]]'', 3 vols, Rolls Series, Longman (1858).&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicler [[Polydore Vergil]] made some use of Boece for his 1534 ''Historia Anglica''.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; David Chalmers of Ormond in his ''Histoire abbregée'' (1572) wrote about the French, English and Scottish monarchies, relying on Boece for the Scottish account.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=5069|title=Chalmers, David|first=Julian|last=Goodare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia'' was translated into English for [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland''. The account in Holinshed's ''Chronicle'' was then used by [[William Shakespeare]] as the basis of his play ''[[Macbeth]]''. [[George Buchanan]] made heavy use of Boece in his ''Rerum Scoticarum Historia'' (1582).&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

;Boece's sources
Boece's claimed sources fell into three classes. The works of [[John Fordun]] (''[[Chronica Gentis Scotorum]]'') and [[Walter Bower]] (''[[Scotichronicon]]'') defined the tradition which he attempted to make seamless, filling the gaps in the chronicle, and applying the approach common to [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of his period. The works of [[Tacitus]] had been rediscovered, in the 14th century, and contained material relevant to [[Britons (historical)|British]] history; and Boece was concerned to integrate it into the tradition. Finally there was a group of sources that remain debated: material from Elphinstone, and the authors Veremundus, Cornelius Hibernicus, and John Campbell. No written record of these works survives.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Sharp criticism of the sourcing of Boece's history was voiced in the sixteenth century by [[Humphrey Lhuyd]] and [[John Twyne]]. In the eighteenth century the historical content of the earlier parts of work was effectively dismantled by [[Thomas Innes (historian)|Thomas Innes]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Boece shared in the credulity of his age; the approach of Mair, who was writing in parallel at the same time, but with a different focus and with a more critical and less sweeping method, did not represent the current fashion.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; The charge of actually inventing his authorities, formerly brought against Boece, has been the subject of recent scholarship. One example of Boece being cleared of the charge of fabricating his work concerns the Battle of Luncarty [[Luncarty]] [[Clan Hay]]. He was suspected by the Scottish historian John Hill Burton&lt;ref&gt;John Hill Burton; The History of Scotland from Agricola's Invasion to the Revolution of 1688, Vol.1, p.364-365, Will. Blackwood and Sons, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; of inventing that battle but, Walter Bower writing in his ''Scotichronicon''&lt;ref&gt;S Taylor, DER Watt, B Scott, eds (1990). Scotichronicon by Walter Bower in Latin and English.Vol.5. Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press. pp. 341–343.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1440, some 87 years before Boece first published his Scotorum Historia, refers to the battle briefly. The "John Campbell" is tentatively identified as Boece's contemporary John Campbell of Lundie (died 1562). "Veremundus", it is argued, may be a Richard Vairement of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/boece/intro.html|title=intro|website=www.philological.bham.ac.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Magill White''' (November 28, 1853 – October 28, 1944) was an [[US|American]] academic and instructor. She holds the distinction as the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.

==Early life and education==
'''Helen Magill''' was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], to Edward Hicks Magill and Sarah Warner Beans. She was the eldest of six children in a [[Quaker]] family. Magill was brought up to believe that she deserved the same education as a man and all five Magill daughters were educated to become college teachers. In 1859, the family moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Magill enrolled as the only female student in the [[Boston Latin School|Boston Public Latin School]]. Her father taught French and Latin there for three years, and he was promoted to submaster.&lt;ref name="BritannicaHelen"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642046/Helen-Magill-White|title=Helen Magill White (American educator) |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher= britannica.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swarthmore1883"&gt;{{cite web| title= 1883: Edward Hicks Magill (1825-1907)| work= 'An Onward Spirit': A Brief History of Swarthmore College| publisher= Swarthmore College |url= http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1883.html| accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, Magill's father joined the faculty of the new [[Swarthmore College]] which was founded by Quakers in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], [[Pennsylvania]], near [[Philadelphia]]. Magill enrolled as an undergraduate. In 1871 her father was selected as the college's second president, serving for 17 years. The younger Magill graduated as a member of the Class of 1873, Swarthmore's first graduating class (five women and one man).&lt;ref name="SwarthmoreIndex2"&gt;{{cite web| title= 1873: Graduation of the First Class| url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/index2.html|work= 'An Onward Spirit': A Brief History of Swarthmore College| publisher= Swarthmore College |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magill attended graduate school at [[Boston University]], earning her Ph.D. in Greek in 1877. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.&lt;ref name="ArchiveWomens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|title=Women’s, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Faculty |publisher= Boston University|archivedate= 12 October 2013 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035256/http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/ |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magill traveled to England, studying at the [[University of Cambridge]] and placing third in her 1881 tripos (honors examinations) at [[Newnham College]].&lt;ref name="BritannicaHelen" /&gt;

Magill's dissertation, ''The Greek Drama'', was long considered lost but it has been found in her papers in the Rare Book and Manuscript Collections, [[Cornell University]] Library in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/all-scholars/9221-white-helen-magill|title=WHITE, Helen Magill|last=Gordon|first=Laura|website=Departmental Web Site Template {{!}} Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM04107.html|title=Guide to the Helen Magill White Papers,1865-1938|website=rmc.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving as the [[school principal|principal]] for a year at a private school in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], Magill was selected on the recommendation of Edward Everett Hale to organize [[Howard Collegiate Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/collections/commonwealth-oai:1r66jc06p|title=West Bridgewater Public Library's Howard Seminary for Women photographs - Digital Commonwealth|website=www.digitalcommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] in 1883. Howard was a non-sectarian school for about forty women and Magill had the authority to choose teachers and conduct college courses. Magill's father contributed funds for a laboratory and gymnasium and two of Magill's sisters taught courses. Although the school expanded rapidly (and therefore needed a new building to accommodate students), Magill resigned in 1887 due to family reasons and due to a dispute with the trustees over her campaign for the provision of better sewerage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA588&amp;lpg=RA2-PA588&amp;dq=%22howard+collegiate+institute%22+%22helen+magill%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mcxEoPO6el&amp;sig=oR6xIVc6GSMF3k0_pWNRlP6pFtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj974WloMbcAhUvgVwKHW0KBv8Q6AEwB3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22howard%20collegiate%20institute%22%20%22helen%20magill%22&amp;f=false|title=Notable American Women, 1607-1950: A Biographical Dictionary|last=College|first=Radcliffe|date=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627345|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magill taught for a short amount of time at [[Evelyn College for Women]], a women's annex to [[Princeton University]]. Suffering from an illness, she taught physical geography at [[Brooklyn High School of the Arts|Brooklyn High School]] for a few years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Helen Magill met [[Andrew Dickson White|Andrew D. White]] in 1887 while she was presenting a paper about her time at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] at the [[American Social Science Association]]. A college classmate of Magill's father, White was retired from his many years as first president of [[Cornell University]]. He had been widowed that year. White described Magill and her paper in his diary as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Perfect manner &amp; exquisite voice - altogether a triumph for this little Quakeress - daughter of my college mate Magill - of which I am proud."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;White encouraged Magill to apply for the post of Director of Sage College for Women at [[Cornell University]]. Magill however had been shaken by her experience of directorship of the Howard Collegiate Institute and depression and illness kept her at home for some time. While teaching at [[Brooklyn High School of the Arts|Brooklyn High School]], Magill maintained a correspondence with White where she commented on her perceived failings:&lt;blockquote&gt;"but it makes me miserable sometimes to think what I might have already done, if I had produced more and criticized less." (May 15th 1888)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Magill and White married in September 1890, and had three children, Edward Magill White (died 1896), Hilda White (1891-1892), and Karin Andreevna White (1893-1971).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29821475/helen-white|title=Helen Magill White (1853-1944) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magill accompanied her husband when he was appointed to diplomatic posts in [[St. Petersburg]] (1892–94) and [[Berlin]] (1897–1903). Magill was presented at both courts and was a noted conversationalist, discussing architecture, sculpture, music, and literature with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaisar Wilhelm II]]. Following the family's return to the United States, Magill did not participate in public or academic life any further.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Other pursuits==
Helen Magill White published a letter in 1913 opposing [[women's suffrage]]. However, some historians believe she was expressing her opposition to the actions of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] in England, rather than to the suffrage cause.&lt;ref name="NytimesPdf"/&gt; The Union's militant acts included burning churches, bombing homes, and sending letter bombs to public officials.&lt;ref name="NytimesPdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/04/14/100394304.pdf|title=UPBRAIDS SUFFRAGISTS - Since They Condone Outrages, Mrs. White Refuses Cash. |publisher= NYTimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After [[Andrew Dickson White|Andrew D. White]] died in 1918, Magill lived abroad and in [[Ithaca, New York]]. She retired to [[Kittery Point, Maine|Kittery Point]], [[Maine]], where she died in 1944.&lt;ref name="BritannicaHelen" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Italy]]''' has a long history of different coinage types, which spans thousands of years. Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the [[florin (Italian coin)|florin]], one of the most used coinage types in European history, was struck in [[Florence]] in the 13th century. Since Italy has been for centuries divided into many city-states, they all had different coinage systems, but when the country became [[Italian unification|unified]] in 1861, the [[Italian lira]] came into place, and was used until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forex-guide.net/italian-currency.html|title=Forex Trading Information, Learn About Forex Trading|author=|date=|website=www.forex-guide.net|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Italy uses the Euro.

==History==

===Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Ancient Greek coinage|Roman currency}}

Despite the fact that the first Italian coinage systems were used in the [[Magna Graecia]] and [[Etruscan civilization]], the Romans introduced a widespread currency. Unlike most modern coins, Roman coins had [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic]] value. While they contained precious metals, the value of a coin was higher than its precious metal content, so they were not [[bullion]]. Estimates of their value range from 1.6 to 2.85 times their metal content, thought to equal the purchasing power of 10 modern British Pound Sterling (US$15) at the beginning of the Roman Empire to around 18 Pound Sterling (US$29) by its end (comparing bread, wine and meat prices) and, over the same period, around one to three days' pay for a Legionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/worth.html Buying Power of Roman Coins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210071801/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/worth.html |date=10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===

====Florin====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Florin-front.jpg|thumb|right|The front of an Italian florin coin.]] --&gt;
The florin was struck from 1252 to 1523 with no significant change in its design or metal content standard. It had 54 [[grain (measure)|grains]] of gold (3.5g). The [[Florin (Italian coin)|"fiorino d'oro"]] of the [[Republic of Florence]] was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the seventh century. As many Florentine banks were international supercompanies with branches across Europe, the florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe for large scale transactions, replacing silver bars in multiples of the [[Mark (unit)|mark]] (a [[Units of measurement|weight unit]] equal to eight troy ounces).

In the fourteenth century, one hundred and fifty European states and local coin issuing authorities made their own copies of the florin. The most important of these was the [[Hungarian forint]] because the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was a major source of gold mined in Europe (until the [[New World]] began to contribute to the supply in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most of the gold used in Europe came from Africa).

===Early modern history===
The early modern Italian coins were very similar in style to French francs, especially in decimals, since it was ruled by the country in the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. They corresponded to a value of 0.29 of gold or 4.5&amp;nbsp;grams of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmarengo.com/italia/welcome.htm|title=Italian coins|author=|date=|website=www.ilmarengo.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papal States scudo====
[[File:M bai 1816.jpg|thumb|left|A Papal States scudo with [[Pope Pius VII]].]]
The [[Papal States scudo]] was the coinage system used in the [[Papal States]] until 1866. Between 1798 and 1799, the [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary French forces]] established the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]], which issued coins denominated in baiocco and scudo. In addition, the states of Ancona, Civitavecchia, Clitunno, Foligno, Gubbio, Pergola and Perugia changed their coinage system to that of the Roman Republic.

In 1808, the Papal States were annexed by France, and [[French franc]]s circulated as the official coins. When the Pope's authority was restored in 1814, the scudo was restored as the currency. However, the coinage of the individual states was not resumed. In 1849, another [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was established which issued coins centrally and in Ancona.

In 1866, the scudo was replaced by the [[Papal States lira|lira]], equivalent to the [[Italian lira]]. The exchange rate used was 5.375 lire = 1 scudo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesionline.it/__PDF/9525/9525p.pdf] {{it_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parman lira====
[[File:Maria Luigia 10 soldi 768767.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Half Parman lira]]
The [[Parman lira]] was [[Parma]]'s official currency before 1802, and later revived from 1815 to 1859. The [[Duchy of Parma]] had its own coinage system until it was made a part of France in 1802. This lira was subdivided into 20 ''soldi'' ([[Grammatical number|singular]]: ''soldo''), each of 12 ''denari'' (singular: ''denaro''), with the ''sesino'' worth 6 denari and the ''ducato'' was worth 7 lire. The currency was replaced by the [[French franc]].

After the re-establishment of Parman independence, the Parman currency system was introduced in 1815. Also called the lira, it was subdivided into 20 ''soldi'' or 100 ''centesimi''. However, this lira was equal to the French franc and the [[Sardinian lira]], and it circulated alongside the latter. It weighed 5&amp;nbsp;grams, and had a purity of 9/10 of silver. Since 1861, Parma has used the equivalent [[Italian lira]].

====Neapolitan piastra====
[[File:Piastra 1805.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Neapolitan 120 grana (1 piastra) coin]]
The [[Neapolitan piastra]] was the most common silver coin of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. In order to distinguish it from the piastra issued on the island of Sicily, it is referred to as the "Neapolitan piastra" as opposed to the "[[Sicilian piastra]]". These two piastra were equal but were subdivided differently. The Neapolitan piastra was divided into 120 ''grana'' (singular: ''grano''), each of 2 ''tornesi'' (singular: ''tornese'') or 12 ''cavalli'' (singular: ''cavallo''). There were also the ''carlino'' worth 10 grana and the ''ducato'' worth 100 grana.

====Two Sicilies piastra====
The [[Two Sicilies piastra]] was the coinage system or currency of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] between 1815 and 1860. It was subdivided into 120 ''grana'' (singular: ''grano''), each of 2 ''tornesi'' (singular: ''tornese''). Accounts were kept in ''ducato'', worth 100 grana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=poU2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR40''A Handbook for Travellers in Southern Italy ''(1868)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sardinian lira====
[[File:Carlo Felice 1 lira genova.jpg|left|thumb|Sardinian 1 lira (1828)]]
The [[Sardinian lira]] was the currency of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] between 1816 and 1861. It was subdivided into 100 ''centesimi'' (singular ''centesimo '') and was equal in value to the [[French franc]], which had replaced the [[Piedmont scudo|Piedmontese]] and [[Sardinian scudo]]s by 1799. It was replaced at par by the [[Italian lira]].

====Tuscan fiorino====
[[File:Fiorino 1856.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fiorino: [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany]].]]
The [[Tuscan fiorino]] was the currency of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] between 1826 and 1859. It was subdivided into 100 ''quattrini'' (singular: ''quattrino''), with an additional denomination called the ''paolo'', worth 40 quattrini, in circulation.

====Lombardy-Venetia florin====
The [[Lombardy-Venetia florin]]s were the coins of [[Lombardy-Venetia]] (reduced to the sole Venetia three years before) between 1862 and 1866. It replaced the [[Lombardy-Venetia pound|pound]] at a rate of 1 florin = 3 pounds. The florin was equivalent to the [[Austro-Hungarian gulden]] (also called the florin). Although it was subdivided into 100 ''soldi'' rather than 100 [[Kreuzer]], Austrian coins circulated in Venetia. The only coins issued specifically for Venetia were copper ½ and 1 soldo pieces.

===Modern period (Kingdom and Republic of Italy)===
The [[lira]] was made the official currency of Italy in 1861 after the [[Italian unification]], however stopped being used in 2002. The euro coinage system entered circulation in Italy in 2002 and is currently the official currency.

====Lira====
[[File:Viktor Emanuel.JPG|thumb|left|220px|An 1865 [[Italian lira]] coin.]]
{{Main|Italian lira}}
Upon the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under [[Victor Emmanuel II|Vittorio Emanuele II]] (1861), a unified lira was established, at 4.5&amp;nbsp;grams of silver or 290.322 milligrams of gold. This was a direct continuation of the [[Sardinian lira]]. Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the [[Lombardy-Venetia pound]], the [[Two Sicilies piastra]], the [[Tuscan fiorino]], the [[Papal States scudo]] and the [[Parman lira]]. In 1865, Italy formed part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]] in which the lira was set as equal to, among others, the [[French franc|French]], [[Belgian franc|Belgian]] and [[Swiss franc]]s: in fact, until the introduction of the euro in 2002, people speaking the [[Gallo-Italic]] [[dialect]]s in north-western Italy usually called ''"franc"'' the lira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialettando.com/poesie/detail_new.lasso?id=5036|title=Poesie e Prose in dialetto|author=|date=|website=www.dialettando.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I broke the Latin Monetary Union and resulted in prices rising severalfold in Italy. Inflation was curbed somewhat by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], who, on 18 August 1926, declared that the exchange rate between lira and pound would be £1 = 90 lire—the so-called [[Quota 90]], although the free exchange rate had been closer to 140–150 lire per pound. In 1927, the lira was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1 dollar = 19 lire. This rate lasted until 1934, with a separate "tourist" rate of US$1 = 24.89 lire being established in 1936. In 1939, the "official" rate was 19.8 lire.

After the Allied invasion of Italy, an exchange rate was set at US$1 = 120 lire (1 [[British pound]] = 480 lire) in June 1943, reduced to 100 lire the following month. In German occupied areas, the exchange rate was set at 1 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] = 10 lire.

After the war, the Roman mint first issued the first 1, 2, 5 and 10 lira coins (6 September 1946). They were officially set up on 21 December of the same year and were used up to 1953–4.&lt;ref name="ilmarengo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmarengo.com/italia/repubblica/welcome.htm|title=Italian Republic coins|author=|date=|website=www.ilmarengo.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the lira fluctuated, before Italy set a peg of US$1 = 575 lire within the [[Bretton Woods System]] in November 1947. Following the devaluation of the pound, Italy devalued to US$1 = 625 lire on 21 September 1949. This rate was maintained until the end of the Bretton Woods System in the early 1970s. Several episodes of high inflation followed until the lira was replaced by the euro.

The lira was the official unit of currency in [[Italy]] until 1 January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on 28 February 2002. The conversion rate is 1,936.27 lire to the euro.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimalira.it/inglese/storia_lira_compl.html&lt;/ref&gt;
All lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, as all post WW2 coins, are still exchangeable for euros in all branches of the Bank of Italy until 29 February 2012.

====Euro====

{{Main|Italian euro coins}}
The euro officially began circulating in Italy on 1 January 2002 (even though the creation of Italian lira coins was suspended in 1999).&lt;ref name="ilmarengo.com"/&gt; [[Italian euro coins]] have a design unique to each denomination, though there are many themes of works by one of the most renowned and famous Italian artists and painters. Each coin is designed by a different designer, from the 1 cent to the 2 euro coin they are: Eugenio Driutti, Luciana De Simoni, Ettore Lorenzo Frapiccini, Claudia Momoni, Maria Angela Cassol, Roberto Mauri, Laura Cretara and Maria Carmela Colaneri. All designs feature the [[European symbols|12 stars of the EU]], the year of imprint, the overlapping letters "RI" for ''Repubblica Italiana'' (Italian Republic) and the letter R for Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/eurocoins/eurocoinsitaly.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; There are no Italian euro coins dated earlier than ''2002'', even though they were certainly minted earlier, as they were first distributed to the public in December 2001.

[[File:NPosthumus.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Posthumus]], director (1937-1952) and founding father of the IISH]] 
'''The International Institute of Social History''' (IISG) is one of the largest archives for labour, left and social history in the world. It is an independent scientific institute in [[Amsterdam]]. The IISG is part of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. It was founded in 1935 by [[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Nicolaas Posthumus]]. The large archives of the institute (ca. 50&amp;nbsp;km) harbor invaluable and extensive papers of several international social movements and currents, including papers of individuals such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/en/about/history History of IISG]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the institute ==
The International Institute of Social History was founded in 1935 by [[Nicolaas Wilhelmus Posthumus|Nicolaas Posthumus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergvelt|first1=Ellinoor|last2=Knegtmans|first2=Peter Jan|last3=Schilder|first3=Marian|title=Colourful professors: 375 years of portraiture in the collection of the Universiteit van Amsterdam|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcZfbSRUYjcC&amp;pg=PA121|year=2007|publisher=Amsterdam UP|isbn=9789056294496|pages=120–21|chapter=Nicolaal Wilhelmus Posthumus (1880-1960)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To examine how [[labour movement|labour relations]] develop over time, IISG collected archives from all over the world. During the first years Posthumus succeeded in obtaining many papers from anarchists ([[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] manuscripts), other [[socialism|socialist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] and [[Marxist]] movements from Germany and Russia.

Before the [[Germans invaded the Netherlands]] in 1940, Posthumus was able to move the most valuable archives to London. During the war, many remaining IISG archives were transported to Nazi Germany. They were not destroyed. Most of the papers were rediscovered in Hannover in 1946, and some other parts were later found in archives in Moscow in 1991, and returned to Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/en/about/history-iish History of IISG (more)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the International Institute of Social History moved to new premises: an old warehouse at the Cruquiusweg in the eastern part of Amsterdam. This building also housed the [[Press Museum]] but in 2017 that museum became a part of the Dutch Institute for Image and Sound (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid) in Hilversum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beeldengeluid.nl/organisatie/persmuseum-en-beeld-en-geluid-verder-als-een-organisatie|title=Persmuseum en Beeld en Geluid: Verder als één organisatie|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=Beeld en Geluid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Archives ==
The personal archives at the International Institute of Social History are extensive, including (among many others) the collections of the papers of [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], [[Alexander Atabekian]], [[Angelica Balabanoff]], [[Bernt Carlsson]], [[Ruth Fischer]],  [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Arthur Lehning]], [[Max Nettlau]], [[Theodor Liebknecht]], [[Toma Sik]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Leon Trotsky]].

There are also many institutional archives, among which the archives of the Russian [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], the [[Red Army Faction]] and the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (well over 200 m.). One of its most famous archives are the archives of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and its political arm, the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI). These archives were smuggled out of Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and made their way to Paris branch of the IISG in secret. The archives contain information regarding military activities, correspondence and financial documents. Other anarchist archives were destroyed during the war or remain lost which makes these collection in the IISG all the more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialhistory.org/en/collections/spanish-civil-war-collection-guide|title=Spanish Civil War Collection Guide|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=International Institute of Social History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the last decades the IISG also acquired the archives of [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]].

A related institution is the [[Swiss Social Archives]] in Zurich.

Historian of anarchism [[Paul Avrich]] wrote that the institute is the foremost repository of anarchist documents in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Avrich |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul Avrich |title=Review of The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1467–1468 |date=1979 |doi=10.2307/1861661 |issn=0002-8762 |jstor=1861661 }}

'''Francisco Javier de Burgos y del Olmo''' (October 22, 1778, [[Motril]]&amp;mdash;January 22, 1848, [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[jurist]], politician, journalist, and translator.

==Early life and career==
Born into a noble but poor family, he was destined for a career in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but soon abandoned his studies in Granada and left for Madrid - where he took law courses. When the [[France|French]] invaded under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], at the start of the [[Peninsular War]] (1808-1814), Burgos, as one of the ''[[afrancesado]]s'' (supporters of [[List of Spanish monarchs|King]] [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]]), took up administrative duties in [[Andalusia]]. His willingness to collaborate had made him an enemy of the [[House of Bourbon]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} and made him leave for [[Paris]] in 1812.

In France, Burgos completed his academic training by studying the works of the [[Classics]], and started translating the works of [[Horace]] into [[Spanish language|Castilian]] (a version notably analysed by [[Andrés Bello]], who deemed Burgos "a poor translator, but an excellent commentator"). Much later (1844), Burgos published a revised version, which, although still flawed, has remained a reference - for instance, it is appreciated for its use of the [[sapphic stanza]] with [[free verse]].

==Prominence==
He returned to Madrid in 1819, and was appointed editor of ''El Imparcial'' in 1822 (the paper was a rallying point for moderate [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberalism]] and the ''afrancesados''). During the same period, Burgos showed himself to be a prolific author, writing a publishing a multiple volume work entitled ''Biografía universal''. He was also integrated in the Bourbon administration of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], being appointed undersecretary of State in [[Francisco Cea Bermúdez]]'s Ministry. Under the [[Regent|regency]] of [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]], as the driving force behind the [[1833 territorial division of Spain]], Burgos used his influence to turn Spain's previous administrative system into a [[Provinces of Spain|provincial]] one, advocating for the need of a [[centralized government]]. However, his design overtly conflicted with the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|self-government status]] held by the [[History of the Basque people#Revolution and war|Basque districts]], especially with Navarre, heavily conditioned but still [[Kingdom of Navarre|a free-standing Kingdom]]. The move was approved in November–December 1833, the same year he became [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Home Minister]].

He was a [[Spanish Senate|senator]] of the ''Moderado'' liberals regime established during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], as well as a royal counsellor and Interior Minister for the first [[President of the Government of Spain (list)|government]] of [[Ramón María Narváez y Campos, Duke of Valencia]]. His office as Minister was taken over by Narváez's successor, [[Francisco Javier Istúriz]].

He also wrote poems marking events such as the death of [[María Isabel de Braganza]] and the wedding of Ferdinand VII and Maria Christina, as well as the notable ''Oda a la Razón''.

'''John Massy Stacpoole''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE}} (30 September 1919 – 5 September 2018) was a New Zealand historian, heritage architect and bibliophile, who was responsible for the restoration of many historic buildings and wrote on colonial architecture and social history in New Zealand. 

==Early life and family==

Prof '''John Stuart Blackie''' [[FRSE]] (28 July 1809 – 2 March 1895) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] scholar and [[man of letters]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Glasgow]], on Charlotte Street, the son of [[Aberdeen]] banker, Alexander Blackie (d.1846) and Helen Stodart.&lt;ref name=fells&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |title=Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002 |website=Royal Society of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[New Academy]] and afterwards at the [[Marischal College]], in [[Aberdeen]], where his father was manager of the Commercial Bank.

After attending classes at [[Edinburgh University]] (1825–1826), Blackie spent three years at [[Aberdeen]] as a student of theology. In 1829 he went to Germany, and after studying at [[Göttingen]] and Berlin (where he came under the influence of [[Heeren]], [[Otfried Müller]], [[Schleiermacher]], [[August Neander|Neander]] and [[Böckh]]) he accompanied [[Christian Charles Josias Bunsen|Bunsen]] to Italy and Rome. The years spent abroad extinguished his former wish to enter the Church, and at his father's desire he gave himself up to the study of law.

He had already, in 1824, been placed in a lawyer's office, but only remained there six months. By the time he was admitted a member of the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (1834) he had acquired a strong love of the [[classics]] and a taste for letters in general. A translation of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]'', which he published in 1834, met with considerable success, winning the approbation of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]. After a year or two of desultory literary work he was (May 1839) appointed to the newly instituted chair of [[Humanities|Humanity]] ([[Latin]]) in the Marischal College.

Difficulties arose in the way of his installation, owing to the action of the [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]] on his refusing to sign unreservedly the [[Confession of Faith]]; but these were eventually overcome, and he took up his duties as professor in November 1841. In the following year he married. From the first his professorial lectures were conspicuous for the unconventional enthusiasm with which he endeavoured to revivify the study of the classics; and his growing reputation, added to the attention excited by a translation of [[Aeschylus]] which he published in 1850, led to his appointment in 1852 to the professorship of [[Greek language|Greek]] at [[Edinburgh University]], in succession to [[George Dunbar (classical scholar)|George Dunbar]], a post which he continued to hold for thirty years.

He was somewhat erratic in his methods, but his lectures were a triumph of influential personality. A journey to [[Greece]] in 1853 prompted his essay ''On the Living Language of the Greeks'', a favorite theme of his, especially in his later years; he adopted for himself a modern Greek pronunciation, and before his death he endowed a travelling scholarship to enable students to learn Greek at [[Athens]].

[[Scottish nationality]] was another source of enthusiasm with him; and in this connection he displayed real sympathy with [[Scottish Highlands|highland]] home life and the grievances of the [[crofters]]. The foundation of the [[Celt]]ic chair at Edinburgh University was mainly due to his efforts. In spite of the many calls upon his time he produced a considerable amount of literary work, usually on classical or Scottish subjects, including some poems and songs of no mean order.

Blackie was a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] and [[Scottish nationalist]] in politics, of a fearlessly independent type; possessed of great [[conversation]]al powers and general versatility, his picturesque eccentricity made him one of the characters of the [[Edinburgh]] of the day, and a well-known figure as be went about in his [[Full plaid|plaid]], worn [[shepherd]]-wise, over one shoulder and under the other, wearing a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a big stick.

In the 1880s and 1890s, he lectured at Oxford on the pronunciation of Greek, and corresponded on the subject with [[William Hardie]]. In May 1893, he gave his last lecture at Oxford, but afterwards admitted defeat, stating: "It is utterly in vain here to talk reasonably in the matter of Latin or Greek pronunciation: they are case-hardened in ignorance, prejudice and pedantry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Stuart |title=John Stuart Blackie: Scottish Scholar and Patriot |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7486-1185-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSsD5oylHKcC&amp;pg=PA189 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at 9 Douglas Crescent&lt;ref name=fells/&gt; in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/03/03/106079272.pdf |title=Death of John Stuart Blackie; The Life Related in the Works of Scotland's Great Scholar |work=New York Times |date=3 March 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] to the north side of the central path in the north section of the original cemetery. His nephew and biographer, Archibald Stodart Walker (1869-1934) is buried with him.

In 1895 a plaque, designed by [[Robert Lorimer]] was erected to his memory in [[St Giles Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jona Lendering''' (born 29 October 1964 in [[Beneden-Leeuwen]], [[Gelderland]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[historian]] and the author of books on [[Ancient history|antiquity]], [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch history]] and modern [[management]]. He has an MA in history from [[Leiden University]] and an MA in Mediterranean culture from the [[Vrije Universiteit|Amsterdam Free University]],&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |title=About Jona Lendering |work=Livius |url=http://www.livius.org/contributor/jona-lendering/ |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; taught history at the Free University, and worked as an [[archivist]] employed by the Dutch government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Livius.org |work=Livius |url=http://www.livius.org/about.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040219193759/http://www.livius.org/about.html |archivedate=19 February 2004 |accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming one of the founders of the history school Livius Onderwijs.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Career and works==
Lendering's biography of [[Alexander the Great]] (''Alexander de Grote'') attempted to make greater use than earlier scholars of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Babylonia]]n sources. For example, he argued from [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] that [[Darius III of Persia]] was deserted by his troops when he faced Alexander at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], rather than personally leading the retreat as reported by Greek sources.&lt;ref name=stronk&gt;{{cite web |author=Jan P. Stronk |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2005/2005-07-35.html |accessdate=2008-12-09 |title=Jona Lendering, ''Alexander de Grote. De ondergang van het Perzische rijk''. |date=July 2005 |work=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work, "Alexander de Grote. De ondergang van het Perzische rijk" was described by ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' contributor Jan P. Stronk from the University of Amsterdam, as "clear and compelling" and "manifestly written for the general public"-and although not sharing Lendering's love for psychological profiles, Lendering's work may be regarded as an incentive for serious scholars looking to expand their knowledge of new sources of ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-07-35.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2005.07.35 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a passage cited by one commentator as characteristic of recent unsympathetic interpretations of Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Betsy Carpenter |date=November 14, 2004 |title=Alexander's new look |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/041122/22alex.htm |accessdate=2008-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lendering argued that Alexander's respectful treatment of Darius' family was not just an act of chivalry but also a claim to be the "new king". ''Quality Non-Fiction from Holland'' called ''Alexander de Grote'' "fascinating" and highlighted Lendering's attention to non-Western evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jona Lendering, ''Alexander the Great'' (''Alexander de Grote''): The fall of the Persian Empire, 340–320 |journal=Quality Non-Fiction from Holland |year=2004 |url=http://www.nlpvf.nl/book/book2.php?Book=353 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient historian Jan P. Stronk thought it clear from Lendering's book that these sources could at best illuminate specific details of Alexander's life.&lt;ref name=stronk/&gt;

Lendering's interest in using western sources in combination with eastern sources can also be discerned in his book on ancient Rome (''Stad in marmer''), in which he quoted hitherto neglected [[Talmud]]ic sources,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and especially in his book on the legacy of [[Babylon]] and the world of [[Islam]] to Medieval Europe, ''Vergeten erfenis''.

In the ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'', Lendering's review of Kaveh Farrokh ''Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War'' was criticized as being "marred by a series of overt inaccuracies, misconceptions and mistakes with respect to the domain of ancient Iranian studies." Lendering was also described by the authors of the response as displaying "a consistent pattern of ignoring seminal works, journal publications, and research that contradict his points of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-02-02.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2009.02.02 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lendering and Arjen Bosman published "De rand van het Rijk: de Romeinen en de Lage Landen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2011/2011-12-02.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2011.12.02 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |date=2011-12-03 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Livius.org==
Since 1996, Lendering has maintained ''Livius'', a website containing numerous articles on ancient history. The site is divided into sections on specific regions&amp;nbsp;– Anatolia, Persia, Greece, etc.&amp;nbsp;– and an individual selection of topics is treated for each of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Kiely |date=May 20, 2004 |title=Full record display for ''Livius : articles on ancient history'' |work=[[Intute]] |url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=humbul11885 |accessdate=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mesopotamian section contains the recently discovered ''[[Babylonian Chronicles]] of the Hellenistic Period''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html |title=Livius.org: Mesopotamian Chronicles |work= |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Arts, [http://www.let.vu.nl/en/about-the-faculty/academic-staff/staff-listed-alphabetically/staff-l-s/prof-dr-r-j-van-der-spek/index.asp Prof. Dr. R.J.

==Livius Onderwijs==
Livius Onderwijs is an association of teachers interested in ancient Mediterranean societies. ("Onderwijs" is Dutch for "[[education]]".) The association is based in Amsterdam and among other services offers a series of lectures there and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://74.125.79.102/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://www.liviusonderwijs.nl/colleges.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Livius%2BOnderwijs%2522%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26newwindow%3D1%26rlz%3D1C1CHMP_en-GBGB291%26sa%3DG&amp;usg=ALkJrhj6EZldlvmFqIoPdW2Exx6NxEEZug |title=Livius Education: Colleges |work= |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2005 by Lendering and Marco Prins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://74.125.79.102/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://www.liviusonderwijs.nl/wiezijnwij.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Livius%2BOnderwijs%2522%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26newwindow%3D1%26rlz%3D1C1CHMP_en-GBGB291%26sa%3DG&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbdvcrL5nUtkxTjtCgA2D_fo_oxw |title=Livius Education: Who are we? |work= |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
After the publication of Lendering's ''Spijkers op laag water'', a book highly critical about the shortcomings of modern classicists, archaeologists, and historians, the research school of Dutch classicists and historians awarded him their annual "Oikos publieksprijs", recognizing Lendering's contributions to explaining Antiquity to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitgeverijathenaeum.nl/web/Artikel/Jona-Lendering-wint-de-OIKOS-publieksprijs-2010.htm |title=Jona Lendering wint de OIKOS publieksprijs 2010 |publisher=Uitgeverijathenaeum.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213351/http://www.uitgeverijathenaeum.nl/web/Artikel/Jona-Lendering-wint-de-OIKOS-publieksprijs-2010.htm |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he received the [[Nederlands Klassiek Verbond|NKV]] award for his book ''De rand van het rijk'' (later translated into English and published as ''Edge of Empire'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeonet.be/?p=18241|title=ArcheoNet Vlaanderen|work= |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet (now considered to be a copy of an older [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] source) was discovered alongside the seven creation tablets of the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' in the ruined [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] at [[Nineveh]] and was by [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] (1876) originally considered to have been a fragment of the "Tablet VI" detailing the [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian creation myth]], specifically the creation of man by [[Marduk]] (or Merodach, Mirku) and his instructions to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chaldean Account of Genesis", 1876, George Smith, London, pp.78-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyriologist [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] (1896) also considered the tablet to be a fragment of the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Das babylonische Weltschöpfungepos", 1896, pp. 19f, 54f., 88f., 111f.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist [[Leonard William King]] however discovered in 1902 that the tablet was not a fragment of the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', but a separate tablet source listing a brief creation story, but mostly moral precepts assigned to the Babylonian God [[Marduk]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Seven Tablets of Creation", 1902, p. 90 (footnote), p. 202 (Appendix II).&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet was later donated to the [[British Museum]], from which the tablet derived its name.&lt;ref&gt;CUNEIFORM TEXTS FROM BABYLONIAN TABLETS, &amp;c.,
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. PART XIII. 1901. Plate 29-30. [http://www.atla.com/CDRIImages/ETANACDR/01000001.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica tablet of K. 3364 but belonging to the [[Neo-Babylonian]] period was also discovered in the late 19th century and also belongs to the [[British Museum]] (No. 33851).

==Translation and Controversy==

The first translation of the tablet (both reverse and obverse) appeared in [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]]'s ''Chaldean Account of Genesis'' (1876). Smith erroneously assumed that the tablet list of moral laws or instructions were meant for the "newly created pair (man and woman) instructing them in their duties".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1876, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theophilus Pinches]] and [[Leonard William King]] however corrected Smith's misinterpretation, since the instructions or moral laws on the tablet are in fact assigned to [[Marduk]], but the tablet does briefly describe the creation of man.&lt;ref&gt;"The Old Testament...", Kessinger Publishing, 2005 (reprint), Pinches, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, 1902, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy arose specifically over line 18 on the obverse of the tablet since (in Smith's translation) it refers to the creation of a "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') by Marduk:

&lt;center&gt;{{quote|The god Mir-ku (noble crown) in concern, raised a protection?
&lt;center&gt;lord of noble lips, saviour from death&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;of the gods imprisoned, the accomplisher of restoration,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;his pleasure he established he fixed upon the gods his enemies,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;to fear them he made man,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;the breath of life was in him.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;May he be established, and may his will not fail,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;in the mouth of the '''dark races''' which his hand has made.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;The god of noble lips with his five fingers sin may he cut off;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;who with his noble charms removes the evil curse.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1876, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===Theories===

Various different theories have been proposed about the meaning of the "dark race" (line 18) since Smith's translation:

====Symbolic====

[[Gerald Massey]] argued the "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') of K.3364 is purely symbolic and not ethnological.&lt;ref&gt;"Book of the Beginnings", Vol. 2, Gerald Massey, Cosimo, Inc., 2007, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dark "red" skinned====

[[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] proposed that the "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') were the original inhabitants of [[Babylon]] (and the surrounding area of [[Mesopotamia]]) connecting them to the same race as the "Adamites", or descendants of (Biblical) [[Adam]], writing: "in various other fragments of these legends they are called Admi or Adami, which is exactly the name given to the first man in Genesis".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1876, pp.85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The "dark race" connection to [[Adam]] was further popularised by [[Archibald Sayce]] who noted that the Akkadian word ''Adamatu'', meaning "dark red" (earth),&lt;ref&gt;"A concise dictionary of Akkadian", Jeremy A. Black, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000,  p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; appears closely connected to the etymology of Adam and that it relates to dark red skin.&lt;ref&gt;"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments", Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint) Sayce, p. 27f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Chaldean Account of Genesis", 1876, George Smith, Ed. Sayce, 1880, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam in Hebrew translates as "ruddy" according to [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]],&lt;ref&gt;"Hebrew and English lexicon of the Old Testament", Wilhelm Gesenius, Crocker and Brewster, 1860, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; "red, of the colour of blood" according to [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Calmet]],&lt;ref&gt;"Calmet’s Dictionary of the Holy Bible", Augustin Calmet, Holdsworth and Ball, 1830, Vol. 1, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; or "ruddiness of flesh" ("ruddy") according to [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature", James Strong, Vol. A-B, 1867, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word [[Adam]] is ''dam'', meaning blood and some scholars have shown the parallels between this and the creation of man as described in the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' (Tablet VI). In Hebrew also, ''adom'' translates as "ruddy"  or "red", while ''adamah'' as "red soil".&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/hebrew/119.htm Strong's Hebrew Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/hebrew/127.htm Strong's Hebrew Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to [[Josephus]] (c. 94 AD): "This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that is red, because he was formed out of the red earth".&lt;ref&gt;''Antiquities'', book 1, chapter 1, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]], acknowledging the aforementioned links believed that the "dark race" described in K. 3364 (line 18) was a dark reddish skinned aboriginal race of "primitive Babylonia" that were invaded by a white skinned [[Semitic race]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Chaldean Account of Genesis", 1876, George Smith, Ed. Sayce, 1880, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sayce, the original "dark race" were [[Sumer]]ians of the [[Turanid race]], who "belonged to the dark-skinned division, though it is not necessary to suppose them to have been black as the Negro".&lt;ref&gt;Sayce, 1880, pp.82-84. Note: In Sayce's literature the Sumerians are found wrongly called "Accadians". This was before scholars had understood the Semitic Akkadians were distinct to the Sumerians.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] supported Sayce's views and further asserted that the ancient Babylonians knew of two principle races, as found in their inscriptions:  "the ''Adamu'', or dark race and the ''Sarku'', or light race".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1876, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarku (or Sarcu) Sayce and Rawlinson maintained were the Semitic colonists who were white skinned.&lt;ref&gt;"An Elementary Grammar", Sayce, Samuel Bagster and Sons, 1877, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson]] believed that both the aboriginal "dark race" and light skinned Semitic colonists are found preserved in Genesis. 6:1–7 as the "sons of God" and the "daughters of man".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1876, p. 86; Sayce, 1880, pp.83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Sayce concluded by asserting that the Sarku modified [[Adam]] to denote their own "white Semitic population" after the dark red skinned [[Sumer]]ian aborigines were conquered.&lt;ref&gt;"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments", Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 27; Sayce, 1880, pp.83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlinson equated the original "dark race" of [[Babylon]] to a "dark [[Caucasoid]] race", which in terms of later definition became defined as the [[Ethiopid race]] (Cushites).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in "The historical evidences of the truth of the Scripture records", United States Book Co., 1800, George Rawlinson, p. 279f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Winchell (geologist)|Alexander Winchell]], a Professor of Paleontology and history author discussed the racial identity of the "dark race" of K.3364 in his work ''Pre-adamites'' (1880) from which he maintained the "dark race" were sunburnt [[Hamitic|Hamites]] of the [[Mediterranean race]].&lt;ref&gt;"Preadamites; or, A demonstration of the existence of men before Adam", Griggs and company, 1880, pp.158-159, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were also drawn by [[Herbert Spencer]] in his ''The Principles of Sociology'' (1885).&lt;ref&gt;"The Principles of Sociology", 1, Volume 6; Volume 1884, Appleton, 1885, p. 809.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black haired====

Some scholars have argued that the "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') in line 18 of K.3364 refers to the "black-headed" [[Sumer]]ians, as their name suggests they derived it from the fact they were black haired.&lt;ref&gt;"The Quest for Sumer", Leonard Cottrell, Putnam, 1965, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; An array of earlier prominent [[Assyriologists]] have supported this position, noting that the aborigines of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] would only have employed such a name for themselves if they had encountered another people who possessed a different physiognomy, specifically fairer ([[blonde]]) hair: "this implies that there was also a blond race in the country from which their black hair and eyes distinguished them".&lt;ref&gt;"Huxley memorial lecture", Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1902, p. 162ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Waddell]] was also a notable proponent of this theory, but maintained that the Sumerian royal dynasty was blonde ([[Aryan race|Aryan]]) while the lower masses (or 'subject' people) dark black haired primitives.&lt;ref&gt;"Makers of Civilization in Race and History", 1929, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') has then been suggested to only refer to the black hair of the [[Sumer]]ian aborigines of Mesopotamia ([[Fertile Crescent]]) and not their skin complexion. Although some argue the "dark race" refers to both a dark skinned and black haired population.

"Sumerian was replaced by Akkadian in Mesopotamia. Akkadian is a Semitic language related to the tribal tongues of the desert nomads from Syria to Palestine. Semitic people and languages are typically associated with haplogroups E1b1b, T, J1 and J2. Akkadian being from northern Mesopotamia, where J2 is prevalent, early Akkadian speakers were likely to belong overwhelmingly to this haplogroup. However, it is likely that the deeper origins of all Afroasiatic languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Asiatic_languages) start exclusively with haplogroup E."

http://www.eupedia.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-25439.html

====Negroid====

[[Afrocentrism|Afrocentrics]] argue that the "dark race" (''zalmat-qaqadi'') refers to a [[Black African]] ([[Negroid]]) race,
although anthropological and DNA studies undertaken on Sumerian remains do not support this assertion, nor do linguistics connect the Sumerians to any known Negroid language.

“The proto-Afro-Asiatic group carrying the E-P2 mutation may have appeared at this point in time and subsequently gave rise to the different major population groups including current speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages and pastoralist populations.”

The '''Low Moor Ironworks''' was a [[wrought iron]] foundry established in 1791 in the village of [[Low Moor, Bradford|Low Moor]] about {{convert|3|mi}} south of [[Bradford]] in Yorkshire, England. The works were built to exploit the high-quality iron ore and low-sulphur coal found in the area. Low Moor made wrought iron products from 1801 until 1957 for export around the world. At one time it was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire, a major complex of mines, piles of coal and ore, kilns, blast furnaces, forges and slag heaps connected by railway lines. The surrounding countryside was littered with waste, and smoke from the furnaces and machinery blackened the sky. Today Low Moor is still industrial, but the pollution has been mostly eliminated.

==Background==

The ironworks depended on the excellent resources of high-quality coal and iron ore found in the vicinity.
The "better bed" coal came from a seam about {{convert|18|to|28|in}} thick resting on hard sandstone.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=56}}
This coal is particularly low in sulphur.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=346}}
About {{convert|120|ft}} above this coal seam there is a layer of "black bed" coal. The ironstone lies above this layer, holding about 32% iron.
The [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] coal beds lie about {{convert|230|yd}} below the better bed.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=56}}
At the time the ironworks were developed recent technological advances had made it practical to smelt iron using coal rather than charcoal 
and to use steam engines to power the steps in production of iron goods.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=345}}

Most of the land occupied by the iron works was part of the Royds Hall estate. Operation of a coal mine on the estate is mentioned in 1673. 
In 1744 the owner, Edward Rookes Leeds, began to actively develop the coal mines.
About 1780 a wooden railway was built from the Low Moor mines to the coal yard in the centre of Bradford, from where the coal could be carried via the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. Soon after, Leeds went bankrupt.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=2}}
The property was twice offered for sale by auction, in December 1786 and October 1787, but no suitable offer was made.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=344}}
Leeds committed suicide in 1787.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=343}}

In 1788 the estate was sold to a partnership of Richard Hird, a country gentleman, John Preston and John Jarratt for ₤34,000. 
After some sales of shares the partners were Richard Hird, Joseph Dawson,{{efn|Joseph Dawson came from a poor family, but was helped by a gentleman to attend school and then study at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He became a minister at [[Idle, West Yorkshire]], a poorly paying position. To make ends meet he also worked as a farmer, teacher, doctor and coal-master. He invested his savings in the Low Moor ironworks, and became a wealthy man.{{sfn|Crouzet|2008|p=82}} }} 
a minister, and John Hardy, a solicitor. Dawson was interested in metallurgy and chemistry and was a close friend of Dr. [[Joseph Priestley]]. 
He seems to have been the prime mover in the enterprise.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=344}} 
The partners planned to found an ironworks, and engaged an engineer from [[Wigan]] named Smalley to build the blast engine.
Smalley called on Thomas Woodcock to prepare plans for the furnaces, casting houses and other works.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=57}}
Woodcock moved to Low Moor, and was to be architect and general manager until his death in 1833.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=57-58}}

==Expansion==
[[File:Haut fourneau.png|thumb|Blast furnace for production of pig iron. Later the Low Moor furnaces used self-tipping wagons to deliver ore, coke and limestone.]]
Construction of the plant began in June 1790, including blast furnaces and casting shops.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=3}}
The furnaces had square bases, tapering as they rose to about {{convert|50|ft}} in height.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=4}} 
The two furnaces were blown in on 13 August 1791 and the first casting was made by the forgemen three days later.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=347}}
At first the works produced domestic goods, but soon began producing industrial products including parts for steam engines.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=4}}
In 1795 the company won contracts to provide guns, shot and shells to the government, which had been at war with [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] since 1793. By 1799 the works were producing about 2,000 tons of [[pig iron]] per year, from which iron goods were made that ranged from columns used in mill construction to garden furniture.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=6}}

The ironworks were owned by the families of the founders throughout the 19th century, with the addition of the Wickhams, who married into the Hirds.
The annually employed capital grew from ₤52,000 in 1793 to ₤250,000 in 1818.{{sfn|Koditschek|1990|p=44}}
The company started to produce wrought iron in 1801, at first using imported iron but by 1803 using Low Moor pig iron.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=6}}
In 1803 a regiment of volunteers was formed at Low Moor ready to repel the expected French invasion.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=351}}
The works were gradually mechanised. 
By 1805 there was a self-tipping inclined railway to charge the furnaces, a nail slitting mill, two nose-helve hammers and a plate-rolling mill.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=7}}
As the iron works grew, the company built workers' cottages in the district that took the name of North Brierley and a hostel for the boys who worked in the pits.
The boys were given free clothing and schooling. The company also ran several public houses.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=9}}

By the end of the war with France in 1814 the works were producing 33 tons of pig iron weekly.
Prices fell for a while as demand slackened after the war, but demand for gas pipes and street lights began to pick up in 1822.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=10}}
The [[Airedale]] poet John Nicholson wrote in 1829,
{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;When first the shapeless sable ore
Is laid in heaps around Low Moor,
The roaring blast, the quiv'ring flame,
Give to the mass another name:
White as the sun the metal runs,
For horse-shoe nails, or thund'ring guns
...
No pen can write, no mind can soar
To tell the wonders of Low Moor.{{sfn|Nicholson|1876|p=265-266}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}
By 1835 the works were handling a growing volume of orders. There was no room to expand in the original site, which was crowded by industrial works, offices and workers houses. Construction started on a new site to the southeast, and in 1836 two oven-topped blast furnaces came into operation there.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=14}}
In 1842 the company installed a new mill to roll iron plate for engine boilers. In 1843 four pairs of forge hammers were installed, driven by steam engines, and in 1844 the company decided to install one of [[James Nasmyth]]'s newly invented [[steam hammer]]s.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=15}}

==Process==
[[File:Puddling furnace.jpg|thumb|Puddling furnace (1881 illustration)]]
The process to convert ore into [[pig iron]] and then into [[wrought iron]] involved first converting the coal to coke to remove water and sulphur, a process that took 48 hours if done in piles in the yard, or 24 hours if done in ovens.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=59}} 
About 32% of the better bed coal would be lost in coking.{{sfn|Mushet|1840|p=901}}
The ironstone was allowed to weather for some time to free it from shale. Limestone was brought from [[Skipton]] to help separate clay from the iron ore.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=59}}
In 1832 it took {{convert|9750|lb}} of coal, {{convert|2800|lb}} of limestone and {{convert|8500|lb}} of ironstone to make {{convert|2,240|lb}} of pig iron.{{sfn|Scoresby|1839|p=333}}

The ironstone was baked with coke and limestone in a kiln, then emptied into a furnace, from which it came out as ore. 
This was cast into pigs with crystalline or granular structure, and then refined by cold blast, coming out flaky. There were four [[blast furnace]]s, with the air delivered by powerful steam engines.{{sfn|Murray|1867|p=410}}
The iron was then [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddled]], becoming granular and malleable. The steam hammers forged the glowing iron into malleable slabs, which were rolled into wrought iron plates.{{sfn|Murray|1867|p=410}}
Large quantities of slag from the blast furnaces were sold for use in road-making.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=57}}

==Full production==
[[File:James Nasmyth's patent steam hammer.jpg|thumb|[[James Nasmyth]]'s patent [[steam hammer]] ]]
[[Robert Wilson (engineer)|Robert Wilson]], Works Manager at [[James Nasmyth]]'s Bridgewater foundry in Patricroft near Manchester, had improved Nasmyth's 1842 design for a [[steam hammer]], inventing the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer – a critically important improvement.{{sfn|Rowlandson|1875|p=34}}
Nasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range.{{sfn|Nasmyth|Smiles|1883|p=259}}
Nasmyth's first steam hammer was built for the Low Moor Works.  
They rejected the machine, but on 18 August 1843 accepted an improved version with a self-acting gear.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=58}}
From 1845 to 1856 Robert Wilson was employed by the Low Moor Ironworks.{{sfn|Day|McNeil|2013|p=1318}}
While at Low Moor he improved the steam hammer with the "circular balanced valve".{{sfn|Gray|2004|p=77}}
In [[the Great Exhibition]] of 1851 at [[the Crystal Palace]] in London the ironworks exhibited an enormous cannon.{{sfn|Tallis|2011|p=167}}
The company also provided samples of ore, coal, pig iron and wrought iron, a smaller gun, a sugar cane mill, an olive mill and an elliptograph.{{sfn|Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851|1851|p=110}}

The Low Moor company bought the Bierley Ironworks in 1854.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=58}}
By 1855 Low Moor was producing 21,840 tons of iron per year, and was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire.
The foundries at Low Moor produced quantities of guns, shells and shot for troops fighting in the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56) and the [[Indian Mutiny]] (1857–58).{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=16}}
The arms business declined after this, as the government increasingly took charge of weapons production. The works turned to making weldless railway tyres, steam engine boilers, sugar pans for refineries in the West Indies, water pipes and heavy iron components for industrial purposes.{{sfn|The Low Moor Company: London Society 1879|p=350}}

By 1863 there were 3,600 employees at the works including 1,993 miners, 420 furnacemen, 770 forgemen and 323 engineers.
In 1864 a second steam hammer with an 8-ton ram was installed for heavy forgings. In 1871 a third steam hammer of 7 tons was installed. 
New rolling mills were also built to meet demand for iron plates in shipbuilding, supplied by slabs forged in the works.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=17}} 
By 1867 there were about 4,000 employees.{{sfn|Murray|1867|p=411}}  A description of the works at that time said 
{{blockquote|The accumulation of cinders and calcined shale actually overspreads the country, and will soon rival in cubic bulk the mass of the Pyramids. In some cases the hillocks of rubbish have been levelled, and covered with soil brought from a distance... Iron plates, bars and railway tires, sent to Russia, America, India, and, in fact, all over the world, are the principal manufactures here; but guns (from 32 to 68-pounders) are also made here... Every runlet of water for miles around is damned up to supply the works, and every drop is carefully economised. The great furnaces, with broad, flaring flames rising from them, of course attract attention as the works are approached. In form they resemble an ordinary lime-kiln, and, on the summit, in the midst of the eager flames, are strange-looking wheels–appendages of the machinery by means of which the ironstone and other matters are dragged up an inclined plane on iron waggons to the mouths of the furnaces, which waggons, self-acting, where no living power could perform the office, turn topsy-turvy, and there unload their contents.{{sfn|Murray|1867|p=409-410}} }}

In 1868 617,628 tons of Low Moor ironstone were raised, the peak production.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=17}}
In 1876 about 2,000 coal miners were employed in pits ranging in depth from {{convert|30|to|150|yd}} in the surrounding townships of North Bierley, [[Tong village|Tong]], Bowling, [[Shelf, West Yorkshire|Shelf]], [[Wyke]], [[Clifton, West Yorkshire|Clifton]], [[Hipperholme]] and [[Cleckheaton]].{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=56-57}}
Thirteen pumping engines were used to drain water from the mines. 
The company also employed about 800 miners in collieries to the east at [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], [[Churwell]], [[Osmondthorpe]] and [[Potternewton]], near [[Leeds]].
Minerals were carried to the works by horse-drawn wagons or by wagons on tramways drawn by stationary engines.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=57}}

The Low Moor mines produced about 60,000 tons of ore yearly by 1876. The iron was prized for its uniform and brilliant grain, commanding premium prices.
The quality seemed to be due in part to the nature of the ore and coal and in part to the manufacturing process.{{sfn|Cudworth|1876|p=56}}
Production came at the cost of aesthetics. An 1876 description said "the natural effect of the perpetual smoke-canopy under which the vegetation of the district exists is to give to it a dinginess not pleasant to look upon...

The company began to run into difficulty in the late 1880s. Its mines were increasingly scattered and expensive. The rail network had a variety of gauges and used a mix of stationary engines and locomotives. Some of the plant was obsolete and operations were generally inefficient.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=18}}
However, there was continued demand for "Best Yorkshire Iron" for applications where safety was critically important.
In 1888 Low Moor was converted to a limited liability company, although descendants of the founders retained control.
The directors planned two new blast furnaces at the New Works, each {{convert|70|ft}} high, with capacities of 340 and 240 tons per week.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=19}}
The first came into operation in 1892. In 1905 an electrical power station was built at the New Works, with boilers fired by gas from the blast furnaces. Apart from the heaviest machines, steam drives were replaced by electrical drives.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=21}} 
The outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914–1918) caused a temporary surge in demand for shell casings and drop forgings, including shoes for the tracks of the first tanks.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=20}}

After the war it was clear that future demand for wrought iron was uncertain. The company was taken over by Robert Heath &amp; Sons of [[Staffordshire]], creating a new company called Robert Heath And Low Moor Ltd. Efforts were made to reduce costs, although this affected quality.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=21}} 
Attempts to use high-sulphur coal created serious problems and destroyed the reputation of the works as a supplier of high quality iron, while a slump in heavy industry in the 1920s further reduced demand. The company poured money into attempts to diversify the operations, but did not succeed. In 1928 the company was declared bankrupt, and the Low Moor assets bought by Thos. W. Ward Ltd. Many of the mines, tracks and plant were closed or dismantled.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=22}} 
Some buildings were sold or leased to other companies, and some plant was modernised. Wrought iron production finally ended in 1957. 
As of 1971 new owners were producing alloy steel, making about 350 tons per week.{{sfn|Dodsworth|1971|p=23}}

The '''''Maulkuerfgesetz''''' ([[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]; "Muzzle law") was a proposed 1937 law in [[Luxembourg]]. Officially, it was entitled the "Law for the defence of the political and social order" ({{lang-fr|Projet de loi pour la défense de l'ordre politique et social}}) but was nicknamed ''Maulkuerfgesetz'' by its opponents. The law would have allowed the Luxembourgish government to ban the [[Communist Party of Luxembourg|Communist Party]] and dissolve any political organisation which they believed might endanger the constitutional institutions. The members of these parties or organisations would be stripped of their political offices and could not be employed by the state or by local governments.

The law was rejected in a referendum on 6 June 1937, and therefore never came into force.

==Background==
[[File:Joseph Bech (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Joseph Bech]], Prime Minister and proponent of the ''Maulkuerfgesetz'', photographed in 1933]]
The origins of the "Law for the defence of the political and social order", also named the ''Loi Bech'' after the prime minister [[Joseph Bech]], go back to the year 1934. The government, a coalition of the [[Party of the Right (Luxembourg)|Right Party]] and the [[Radical Liberal Party (Luxembourg)|Radical Liberal Party]], put the proposed law to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] on 2 May 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.forum.lu/pdf/artikel/1975_97_Dostert.pdf|title = Das Ordnungsgesetz und seine Autoren|last = Dostert|first = Paul|date = July 1987|journal = forum|accessdate = 6 December 2014|doi = |pmid = |issue = 97|pages = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little happened from then to December 1936.

The parties supporting the [[Bech Ministry]], the Right Party and the Liberals, were in favour of the law, the opposition (consisting of the Socialists and other left-wing parties) were not. It took almost 3 years until the law's text was clarified. To understand how a party that received just 9% of the vote in the Chamber elections (many of them protest votes) was seen as such a threat that it had to be banned, one must look at the political context of the time. Especially for the Christian-conservatives, communism was the embodiment of all evil; the Liberals, as representatives of industry and the world of business, were not much more well-disposed. Additionally, the prime minister Joseph Bech had never been a friend of [[universal suffrage]], introduced in 1919, and was nostalgic for census suffrage for the rest of his life.

==Chamber vote and referendum==
{{Main|Luxembourg political parties referendum, 1937}}
The debate in the Chamber started on 16 April 1937, and lasted 4 days. On 23 April the law was adopted by a majority (34 votes for, 19 against, 1 abstention).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.forum.lu/pdf/artikel/1973_97_Anonym.pdf|title = Die Ereignisse (1933-1937)|last = |first = |date = July 1987|journal = forum|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 December 2015|issue = 97|pages = 18–19|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the vote, however, opposition in the country increased rather than fading away, and therefore the Bech government decided to put the matter to a referendum. It was convinced that, with the support of the ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'' and the [[Catholic Church]], they would receive the population's assent. To many people's surprise, a slim majority (50,67 %) rejected the law on 6 June 1937.

==Aftermath==

Joseph Bech then offered his government's resignation to the [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess]]. The latter did not accept it immediately, and so it took until 5 November 1937 for the new [[Dupong-Krier Ministry]] to be sworn in, with Joseph Bech as Foreign Minister, Minister for Wine-growing, and Arts and Sciences.

'''Nicholas J. Saunders'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=nr88-10443}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British academic [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]]. He was educated at the universities of [[Sheffield University|Sheffield]] (BA Archaeology, 1979), [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] (MPhil Social Anthropology, 1981), and [[Southampton University|Southampton]] (PhD Archaeology, 1991). He has held teaching and research positions at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], the [[University of the West Indies]], Dumbarton Oaks, Washington D.C., and at [[University College London]], where he was Reader in Material Culture, and undertook a major [[British Academy]] sponsored investigation into the material culture anthropology of the First World War (1998–2004). {{As of|2014}} Saunders is Professor in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the [[University of Bristol]], where he is responsible for the [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes in [[historical archaeology]] and [[conflict archaeology]]. He is a prominent contributor to the nascent field of [[conflict archaeology]], and has authored and edited numerous academic publications in the field. In addition to his research specialising in the anthropology of 20th-century conflicts and the [[archaeology of World War I]] theatres in [[Belgium in World War I#Belgian_military_operations|Belgium]], [[Western Front (World War I)|France]] and the [[Middle-Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], Saunders has also conducted extensive fieldwork and research in [[pre-Columbian]] and historical archaeology of [[the Americas]]. He has been involved with major museum exhibitions in London, Ypres (Belgium), Tübingen (Germany), and at the [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]] (France). Saunders has investigated and published on [[material culture]]s and landscapes of [[Mesoamerica]], South America, and the [[Caribbean]]. His most recent research has been on the aesthetics of brilliance and colour in indigenous Amerindian symbolism, an extensive survey investigation of the [[Nazca Lines]] in Peru, and the anthropological archaeology of twentieth-century conflict (especially the First World War) and its legacies along the [[Soca (Isonzo) Front]] on the Slovenian-Italian border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''Dr. Nikolai Mossolow''' (1910-1988) was a well known [[Russia]]n-born [[Namibia]]n historian and archivist. He was born in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] on 1 July 1910, to Colonel Constantine Mossolow (1866-1924) and former dancer Xenia Vladimirovna Bosse (1886-1972). Mossolow first came to Namibia, then named [[South West Africa]], in 1931 to visit his mother who had emigrated to that country and married a German [[Karakul sheep|Karakul]] farmer shortly after his father's death. He returned to Europe to study History of Art, Anthropology, Archaeology and Ancient Languages at the [[University of Dorpat]] in [[Estonia]], the  [[Friedrich Wilhelms University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms University]] in [[Berlin]], and the [[German Archaeological Institute]] in [[Rome]]. but returned to South West Africa in 1939 when he saw that the outbreak of [[World War II]] was inevitable. He then worked as an archivist in the National Archives in [[Windhoek]] and later published numerous historical books and articles about South West African places, persons and events. Mossolow married Gisela Herta Alice Wollmann, and on his retirement in the early 1980s, he and his family moved to [[Somerset West]] outside [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], where he died on 9 November 1988.&lt;ref name="www.namibiana.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namibiana.de/namibia-information/who-is-who/autoren/infos-zur-person/nikolai-mossolow.html//about|title=Nikolai Mossolow|accessdate=2013-08-17|publisher=www.namibiana.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.eggsa.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=619863//about|title=MOSSOLOW Niklai 1910-1988|accessdate=2013-08-17|publisher=www.eggsa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namibiana.de/namibia-information/who-is-who/autoren/infos-zur-person/nikolai-mossolow.html|title=http://www.namibiana.de/namibia-information/who-is-who/autoren/infos-zur-person/nikolai-mossolow.html|last=Buchdepot|first=Namibiana|website=www.namibiana.de|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter is the well known South African [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] [[Sabina Mossolow]].&lt;ref name="www.classicsa.co.za"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classicsa.co.za/site/listings/view/classicsa_sabina_mossolow_soprano/?s=musicians&amp;f=ind&amp;m=2&amp;ms=1//about|title=Mossolow, Sabina|accessdate=2013-08-17|publisher=classicsa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Nucleocosmochronology''' or '''nuclear cosmochronology''' is a technique used to determine timescales for [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] objects and events. It compares the observed ratios of [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of heavy [[radionuclide|radioactive]] and [[stable nuclide]]s to the primordial ratios predicted by [[nucleosynthesis]] theory in order to calculate the age of formation of astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="Bland-Hawthorn Freeman 2014 pp. 1–144"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bland-Hawthorn | first=Joss | last2=Freeman | first2=Kenneth | title=The Origin of the Galaxy and Local Group | chapter=Near Field Cosmology: The Origin of the Galaxy and the Local Group | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | publication-place=Berlin, Heidelberg | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-642-41719-1 | issn=1861-7980 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41720-7_1 | pages=1–144| bibcode=2014SAAS...37....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleocosmochronology has been employed to determine the age of the [[Sun]] ({{val|4.57|0.02}} billion years) and of the Galactic [[thin disk]] ({{val|8.8|1.8}} billion years),&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/?0411698 del Peloso et al., "The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology I.

'''Paul Dayton Bailey''' (12 July 1906 — 26 October 1987) was the owner/publisher of Westernlore Press and a writer of many books himself that focused on the Western American experience and, in particular, [[Latter-day Saint]] history.

== Early years ==
Bailey was the son of Eli and Olive Bailey and the grandson of Joseph Forbes. He was raised in [[American Fork, Utah]] until the age of 13 when his father went to [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grant's Pass]], [[Oregon]] to take part in the building of a new [[sugar beet]]-processing [[factory]] for the [[Amalgamated Sugar Company|Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]]. As Eli helped build the factory, he sent letters and money home, finally persuading his family to join him.&lt;ref name=PolyMono&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Paul|title=Polygamy Was Better than Monotony|publisher= Westernlore Press|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family did not stay in Oregon long. Utah-Idaho failed to persuade local farmers to pick up the new crop and, two summers later, Eli was put in charge of dismantling the factory and loading it upon rail cars for reassembly in [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; The family, which had always been poor, grew more impoverished with each move, and the Yakima venture did not pull them out.

The factory was not reassembled in time for the first year's (bumper) crop, and before the second year's crop could be processed, [[World War I]] ended, dropping sugar prices to what Bailey would later describe as "catastrophic lows".&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|114}} The lowered prices were accompanied by a disease called "[[curly top]]" which reduced the previously enormous Washington yields to industry-killing scarcity.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

The Bailey family responded to the death of sugar with a disastrous attempt at [[Potato#Cultivation|potato farming]] in Washington, after which young Bailey ran away, back home to American Fork, where he set up residence with his maternal grandfather Joseph Barlow Forbes and his [[Plural marriage|first wife]]—Bailey's grandmother—Nancy. Living with them meant Bailey was not allowed to drop out of school and work as he had intended.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

A year after his return to American Fork, his mother and his [[siblings]] also returned. Elie moved to [[Idaho Falls]], [[Idaho]] to be foreman at a UISC factory there. Although Eli sent checks to his family, Bailey finally did drop out of school to help support his mother, who would soon divorce Eli, at which point Bailey left home for good with a move to [[Salt Lake City]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

Supporting himself with odd jobs, Bailey put himself through [[Stevens-Henager College|Henager's Business College]] and [[LDS Business College]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; While working at the county [[hospital]] as a night [[orderly]], Bailey met Evelyn Robison. Shortly after impulsively kissing her and getting slapped in return, he moved to [[California]] and she returned to her [[Fillmore, Utah|hometown]] due to illness.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

== Early writing career ==
Shortly after arriving in [[Los Angeles]], Bailey began work as an apprentice [[typographer]]. While working in newspapers, he remet Robison, who was working again at becoming a [[registered nurse]]. They were soon married, which resulted in her expulsion from General Hospital's School of Nursing.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; It was the eve of the [[Great Depression]].

Evelyn undertook secretarial training at Metropolitan College. Bailey's typographic work kept him busy and well employed throughout the Depression. However, he had developed a desire to write. He fed that need initially with fact-based, usually historical articles, including a serialized study of [[Samuel Brannan]], published in the LDS periodicals ''[[Improvement Era|Era]]'' and ''[[Millennial Star]]'', and, later, with much success, in book form.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; This began a string of successes with Church-owned publications, such as his novel ''For This My Glory''; about the [[Mormon Battalion]]. His books were popular in Utah and even used as Sunday School texts.

Meanwhile, he had taken reporting jobs at the ''Los Angeles Record'' and ''[[Hollywood Citizen]]'', followed by a sudden opportunity to purchase the ''Eagle Rock Advertiser'', one of two newspapers in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]], a small town outside of Los Angeles. The paper was on the verge of collapse, but since he had both editorial and typographical preparation, Bailey was able to keep costs down and eventually turn the ''Advertiser'' into Eagle Rock's premier paper. Evelyn, for her part, drummed up additional advertising revenue.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

== World War II ==
[[World War II]] brought on serious paper-rationing with smaller newspapers were powerless to work around. While larger LA-area papers were able to purchase Canadian pulp mills to keep in paper, smaller papers were forced to print fewer pages less frequently.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; The Baileys were particularly frustrated because during those boom years, the advertising available was much more than they had paper to print upon.

To supplement income, Bailey took a job reorganizing and running the [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]]'s ''Lockheed Star'', printing five separate editions for the five separate factories in the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] area.

Also during the war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity prevented most interested libraries from purchasing copies. To his surprise, this venture was eased by the [[War Production Board]]'s far less stringent requirements for acquiring book paper. The books published by Westernlore—on the same presses used by the ''Advertiser''—were immediate successes and every edition sold out.

During this time, Bailey also found time to write three new books. The first, a fictionalized version of his [[Samuel Brannan]] biography, and the second (also a novel) were "enthusiastically received by the Saints."&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|189}} The third, ''Jacob Hamblin, Buckskin Apostle'', became a source of controversy. Bailey received angry responses from LDS leadership and the [[Jacob Hamblin|Hamblin]] family—in large part because his book dealt with Hamblin's marriages to two [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] women and two white women, and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. In later years however, ''Buckskin Apostle'' would experience a renaissance in LDS circles—even being published by Church-owned publication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The end of the war saw larger corporations buying up impoverished smaller papers and forcing the others out of business. The ''Advertiser'' was one of the few, hardy small papers that survived the war rationing, only to be forced out of business by larger corporation shortly thereafter.

== Later life ==
Bailey ran Westernlore until 1973, when its inventory was lost in a fire and his son Lynn moved the company to [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="PhotoCollection"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paul Dayton Bailey Photograph Collection, ca 1940-1980|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/apps/history/findaids/C00414/c0414.xml|website=Utah Department of Heritage &amp; Arts|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years he ran it, Westernlore continued to publish books focused on the Western United States that were highly regarded by libraries and well purchased. Westernlore published some of Bailey's own work, but his better known books were published by larger companies.

Many of his later books proved, to his and his publishers' surprise, to be controversial. For instance, ''For Time and All Eternity''—a book about the anti-polygamy crusade in the 1890s—caused a small uproar among the Utah faithful (although, according to [[Samuel W. Taylor]], "Bailey . . . [said the uproar] resulted from the objections of one man to a single passage in the book"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Samuel W.|authorlink1=Samuel W. Taylor|title=Peculiar People, Positive Thinkers and the Prospects of Mormon Literature|journal=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]|date=Summer 1967|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–31|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V02N02_19.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as did his book on [[Zion's Camp]], the Missouri Contingent, the [[Nauvoo Legion]] and the Mormon Battalion— ''The Armies of God.'' Bailey believed the book was "a warm, honest appraisal of Mormon heroism in conquering the West" and his publisher had arranged for numerous interviews and signings in Utah; however, in the end the book was never so much as reviewed in the State.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|197}}

Although estranged in many ways from Mormonism, Bailey always embraced that part of his heritage.

{{quote|As a writer, the fact that I am steeped in Mormon lore, has been more hindrance than help to me. I've never been able to purge from my stubborn mind a conviction that the Mormon tale is one of the most unique and interesting human dramas in the annals of America. It has been my soaring wings; it has been my cement coffin".&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|195}}}}

Evelyn died in 1981. Bailey never remarried; he died in 1987. They were buried in [[Fillmore, Utah]].&lt;ref name=PhotoCollection/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dayton Bailey (1906-1987)|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14475232/paul-dayton-bailey|website=[[Find a Grave]]|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his papers are held by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Aid for the Paul Dayton Bailey Papers, 1940-1953|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1h4n981n/|website=The Online Archive of California|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phylidor''' (17??– 7 March 1829), also spelled "Phylidoor" or "Philidor", also known as "Paul Filidort" and probably the same as '''Paul de Philipsthal''', was a magician and a pioneer of [[phantasmagoria]] shows.

==Biography==
Phylidor's origins are unclear, as is his exact identity; it is believed that he took his name from [[François-André Danican Philidor]] and he was even thought to be the nephew of this French composer and chess master of the famous [[Philidor]] family.&lt;ref name="erzählung"/&gt;

Phylidor reportedly was from the [[Duchy of Brabant]] (now part of Belgium and The Netherlands).&lt;ref name="erzählung"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hghQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA474#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Erzählung einer neulichen Geisterzitation in Berlin|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also claimed to be from the neighboring [[County of Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=qFpDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA551#v=onepage&amp;q=philidor&amp;f=false|title=Histoire des mathématiques, Volume 3''|year=1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylidor reportedly spoke French when he was in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Reck&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hghQAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=philidorschen%20geisterbeschw%C3%B6rung&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nachricht von der Philidorschen Geisterbeschwörung|last=Von der Reck|year=1789|pp=456-}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was thought to be German when he came to Paris in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Magazin Encyclopédique|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k424100p/f21.item.r=phantasmagorie.zoom|date=1792-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1785 to 1800 Phylidor traveled through Europe as a showman (see below for details). He also (at least occasionally) traded in "physical instruments" and taught some of his tricks to paying customers.&lt;ref name=groninger1786/&gt;

By the time Phylidor came to Berlin in 1789 he was married and had a servant.&lt;ref name=chronic5/&gt; He probably was a rich man, at least in the early 1790s: wealthy enough to own a carriage and to bribe a high official, but he may have lost his fortune later on.&lt;ref name=Huhtamo2006&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://library.sdsu.edu/pdf/scua/ML_Gazette/MLGvol18no04.pdf|title=The Magic Lantern Gazette, Volume 18, Number 4|date=Winter 2006|last=Huhtamo|first=Erkki|pages=10–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In handbills, newspaper advertisements and announcements Phylidor sometimes claimed the praise of the royalty of several European courts.&lt;ref name=middelburg/&gt; In 1786 he claimed to have a privilege of the [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Menus-Plaisirs]] of the King of France.&lt;ref name=groninger1786&gt;''[[Groninger Courant]]'' 1786-03-17+21+28 and 1786-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Catherine the Great]] and her court members he reportedly received 1.000 [[Russian rubel|rubels]], a gold tobacco box and a brilliant ring as appreciation for his performance of physics experiments in January 1787.&lt;ref name=groninger1787&gt;{{cite book|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010107548:mpeg21:a0001|title=Groninger Courant|date=1787-01-26|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have gotten praise of the Dresden court for his new show in 1789.&lt;ref name=chronic5/&gt; At least once he claimed to be of nobility, when he was registered in Regensburg in 1792 as "Herr Baron von Phylidor, Physicus von Wien".&lt;ref&gt;Regensburgisches Diarium July 24, 1792&lt;/ref&gt;

Although perceived as a charlatan and a very mediocre magician by enlightened Berliners in 1789, in the eyes of others he gained the reputation of an extraordinary man with special powers. He reportedly helped a lady who came to him for advice about clothes that had been stolen from her house: Phylidor said he would make the thief very unhappy for the rest of his life, if the clothes were not returned the next day. On Phylidor's request she told this to all her servants and the next morning the clothes were back in place. Phylidor also made a barber believe that he had removed his head to shave himself, secretly using an imitation of his head made out of wax.&lt;ref name=chronic5&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZDZMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=phylidor&amp;f=false|title=Chronic von Berlin oder Berlinische Merkwürdigkeiten - Volume 5|year=1789|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around December 1798 to 1800 Phylidor collaborated on his shows with a business partner who was also advertised to be a physicist.&lt;ref name=haagsche1&gt;''[[Haagsche Courant]]''. 1798-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=groninger1800april29 /&gt;

In March 1799 Phylidor had a feud with Dutch glassblower J. Demmenie, who according to Phylidor had copied his show after Phylidor had used a tent of Demmenie's mother and had worked with his brother in law as an attendant. Phylidor took out an ad in two local newspapers to warn the public against this poor copy of his show.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Leydse Courant]]''. 1799.03.23&lt;/ref&gt; Demmenie replied in the newspapers by calling Phylidor an alien libeller and claiming that the used machinery had been known to physicists since a 100 years and shown by others in the region since six years.&lt;ref&gt;''Leydse Courant''. 1799.04.05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Nieuwe Haagse Nederlandse Courant]]''. 1799.04.20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul de Philipsthal==

Phylidor was very likely the same person as Paul de Philipsthal who lived in the U.K. and first performed Phantasmagoria shows in October 1801.&lt;ref name= Rossell2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; 

Philipsthal was granted a British patent for his Phantasmagoria on January 27, 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=qNU0AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;ots=YleFA7llQw&amp;dq=%22Paul%20de%20Philipsthal%22&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Paul%20de%20Philipsthal%22&amp;f=false|title=The Repertory of Patent Inventions - Vol. XVI|year=1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul de Philipsthal and his wife Mary had a son called Albert Augustus and a daughter called Paulina Theresa, both baptized in [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea]] on 13th August 1819.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

Paul de Philipsthal died unexpectedly on 7 March 1829 in Leeds, after a short illness that started the evening before. He had been performing in Leeds for six weeks, but his shows weren't very well attended and he had arranged to perform in Wakefield a few days later. He reportedly left his widow and three children unprovided for, so an appeal was made in the local newspaper to collect funds that would enable the family to move to Hull and get Mrs. Philipsthal established at a school over there.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds Intellegencer, 12-03-1829&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull Packet, 17-03-1829&lt;/ref&gt;
A benefit exhibition for the widow and children of Philipsthal's "Royal Mechanical &amp; Optical Museum" was shown in the Wakefield Theatre.&lt;ref name=Heard2006&gt;Heard, Mervyn. ''PHANTASMAGORIA: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''. The Projection Box, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Much of Phylidor's early shows and stage persona was based on the works of famous magician [[Joseph Pinetti]].&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; Pinetti had performed magic shows and exhibited ingenious mechanical devices across Europe, including performances at the [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Menus-Plasirs]] for the King of France in 1783. Pinetti publicized his shows cleverly. He claimed to be a professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and dressed in courtly attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5X5qlkwZo9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Illustrated%20History%20of%20Magic%20by%20Milbourne%20Christopher&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=pinetti&amp;f=false|title=Magic: A Picture History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylidor usually presented himself as a physicist in his advertisements.&lt;ref name=groninger1800april29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=phantasmorasi&gt;Phylidor ''Phantasmorasi'' handbill. 1792-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haagsche1798november14 /&gt;

Phylidor referenced [[Johann Georg Schröpfer]] and [[Cagliostro]] in several advertisements.&lt;ref name=phantasmorasi/&gt; In the early 1770s Johann Georg Schröpfer had performed [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] [[necromancy|necromantic]] rituals and experiments, raising ghosts that were probably created with many hidden techniques including [[magic lantern]] projections on smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8TWhiohOrcUC&amp;pg=PA181|title=The Masonic Necromancer: Shifting Identities In The Lives Of Johann Georg Schrepfer|first=Renko|last=Geffarth|year=2007|pages=181–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Schröpfer's death there was a boom of publications either attacking or defending his supposed supernatural abilities, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to try to recreate Schrepfer's séances.&lt;ref name= Rossell2001 /&gt; Cagliostro was thought to have performed similar séances.

==Performances==
In the beginning Phylidor's shows were presented as "black art" or "natural [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]" and included conjuring tricks and automata.&lt;ref name=chronic2/&gt; When these weren't received well in Berlin in 1789, he tried to make an impression with the evocation of ghosts.&lt;ref name=Reck/&gt; But Phylidor's first séance resulted in the accusation of being a fraud, he was ordered to stop his activities and was expelled from Berlin. A few months later he published a statement that he never had conjured up any spirits, but that he showed how people could be deceived by charlatans. He regarded his shows by no means as supernatural, but as an art which had already found praise at the Dresden court.&lt;ref name=chronic5/&gt; He further developed his ghost-raising show, probably making use of the recently invented [[Argand lamp]],&lt;ref name="Grau"&gt;[[Oliver Grau|Grau, Oliver]]. ''Remember the Phantasmagoria!'' chapter from ''MediaArtHistories'', MIT Press/Leonardo Books, 2007, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; into a show that could more easily be seen by large audiences.

Over the years his performances were advertised to include "black arts" or "natural magic", [[pyrotechnics]], [[physics]] experiments, [[hydraulics]], [[hydrostatics]] magnetic-mechanical experiments, mechanical pieces of art (including life-size mechanical figures), optical illusions / optical art (including apparitions of ghosts and absent persons) and  [[catoptrics]].

===Dutch Republic (December 1785 to March 1786)===
Phylidor's first known performances were advertised by "Charles Phyllidoor, professor in de physique en Mathematique" to take place at six in the evenings of 27, 29, and 31 December and 2 January 1786 at De Schuttershof in [[Middelburg]]. He promised different tricks for each evening and presented his show as "Zwarte Konst" (Black Art) in one of his newspaper advertisements.&lt;ref name=middelburg&gt;''[[Middelburgsche Courant]]'' 1785-12-27+31&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later "De heer Phylidoor, professor in de Physique en Mathemathique" arrived in Groningen and advertised two "Representations der Zwarte Konst" to take place in the local Concert Zaal at six in the evenings of 22nd and 23rd March. "Moved by the lively appreciation and polite manner of several distinguished gentlemen who engaged him" he would be back on 28 and 30 March for other "amusing experiments", including a trick which involved shooting away a ring that would be returned by Phyllidoor's dove and made to be found inside an orange. Spectators were requested to bring oranges for this purpose.&lt;ref name=groninger1786/&gt; In April he proposed to perform two more wondrous experiments, the first consisting of fireworks of inflammable air in which several animals could be seen. On command of the audience he would make the flames change into 25 different colors. For the second presentation Phylidoor would render a person of the audience unable to move, for as long as pleased him. Subscription to the performances was one [[Ducat]], which was perceived as rather expensive.&lt;ref name=groninger1786 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groningsche  Volksalmanak voor het Jaar 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin (8 February to 30 March 1789)===

====Magic shows====
Arriving from Russia, Phylidor first performed in Berlin on 8th February. The flyer promised "sehenswürdige Magische oder sogenannte Schwarzkunst nachahmende Kunststücke" (great magic tricks that imitate the so-called "black arts"). It would, among other surprises, include the following highlights:
*Theofrastus Paracelsus; a golden head that made lifelike movement and could answer all questions with certain signs
*a magic crystal column, circa 2 feet high, from which certain things would jump up on command of the audience
*der Großsultan; an Ottoman figure that on Phylidor's command would curtsy to the audience and answer questions by movements of his head, understanding questions in German as well as in French 
*a Dutch windmill, with a new sympathetic invention causing its sails to stop and turn according to one's wishes
*a clock on a crystal column, which would tell whatever time desired by the audience, without anyone touching it
*from a distance and without touching it, Phylidor would take the life of a bird that was being held by someone in the audience and then resurrect it
*a magnetic staff would make a round object move around and on command of the audience dance a waltz in the air&lt;ref name=chronic2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BTZMAAAAcAAJ&amp;vq=phylidor&amp;dq=editions%3Ae-z_4RfHC7gC&amp;pg=PA554#v=onepage&amp;q=phylidor&amp;f=false|title=Chronic von Berlin oder Berlinische Merkwürdigkeiten - Volume 2|year=1789|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his "Expériences physiques de St. Philidor" or "magical experiments" of the following weeks were perceived as mediocre magic tricks and raised little applause, Phylidor decided to try something else.&lt;ref name="erzählung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reck"/&gt;

====First failed necromantic session====
[[File:1783 funk - natürliche magie - zu finster zauberkunst.jpg|thumb|The room used by Phylidor reminded Von der Reck of this illustration in Christlieb Benedict Funk's ''Natürliche Magie'' (1783)]]
After twelve days of preparation Phylidor invited an audience of 14 men to an evocation of ghosts at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the 30th of March . The 14 distinguished men did not expect to see real ghosts, but intended to amuse themselves by trying to find out how this magician wanted to fool the audience. They agreed to keep their heads clear to witness the evocation as attentively as possible. Royal Theater director Von der Reck was among the 14 men welcomed by Phylidor's wife and a little man that she called "Professor", before being led through small and dark staircases up to the third floor.

Phylidor was dressed in black and led the visitors into a small darkened room with dazzling white walls, in which a rectangular area was fenced off with a construction of slats with a metal hand on each end. In the center of a chalk circle on the floor were a wand and a small lantern on a folded long black cloth. A container with almost burned out coals stood next to it. Phylidor asked the spectators not to speak, move or touch anything since they were surrounded by terrible dangers. He advised them to hold each other's hands and the ones on the end to hold the metal hands in order not to fall over and as a protection against the dangers. Von der Reck asked the man next to him to let go of his hand, because he did not want to get an electric shock. Phylidor then extinguished the lantern, leaving only the very weak light of the coals. Soon thick white odorous smoke started to spread across the room and Phylidor started the ritual. It included some incantations in a dull but commanding voice with the words "Helion, Melion, Tetragrammaton" (as reportedly used by [[Cagliostro]]), some French sentences like "Parois. Esprit terrible! Esprit terrible, épargne moi!" and the name of Jehovah mixed in repeatedly. A terrible thunder-like noise filled the room and as Phylidor called out: "Esprit, parois!" (Ghost, appear!), a streak of light appeared on the wall that gradually transformed into the (almost) life-size figure of [[Voltaire]], dressed in white and hovering a foot above the floor. Some spectators complained that this was a very poor apparition and clearly a projection of some transparent picture. Phylidor commanded the spirit to disappear and soon an apparition of [[Frederick the Great]] followed. When some visitors complained that the facial features weren't very clear, Phylidor replied that he was surprised that they expected to see this on a ghost. Then Von der Eck confronted Phylidor with the question if it wasn't all just optical illusions. Phylidor threatened with terrible dangers that would be caused by this behavior. Von der Eck and other audience members then demanded to see Phylidor raise the devil, if he would still insist that he really had supernatural powers. He pleaded not to have to do this, but instead to raise the spirit of the deceased father of an Englishman in the audience as they had agreed a few days before. He conjured this apparition, but the image showed a figure in too fashionable an outfit for someone who had died a few years before. In the meantime the smoke had become too irritating and some men called for light and wanted the door to be opened. Phylidor proposed to make [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Heinrich IV]] appear, but couldn't calm his audience and accepted his defeat. Some of the men warned him that it would not end well if he was to perform his deceitful tricks again.&lt;ref name="erzählung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reck"/&gt;

====Aftermath====
The morning after Phylidor's failed séance, he was told by the police not to perform his magic again, because it went "against religion and good manners", and he was ordered to leave Berlin.

After Phylidor had left, Von der Eck examined the room and found some evidence that the apparitions were created by rear projection on a transparent screen in the wall. He also found traces of a metal wire that had been attached to the walls, which he thought was intended to ignite some combustible materials to create the illusion of the complete room being on fire.&lt;ref name="Reck"/&gt;

===Vienna (February 1790 to January 1792)===
Phylidor had further developed his show when he came to Vienna and claimed to have perfected his ghostly apparitions with a totally new invention. He advertised his show in March 1790 as "Phantasmorasi, oder natürlicher Geister Erscheinungen" (Phantasmorasi, or natural ghost apparitions), besides very entertaining magnetic-mechanical experiments in his renewed Cabinet of Physics.&lt;ref name=phantasmorasi/&gt; Spectators would first gather and wait silently in an anteroom, until the physicist ordered them to enter a black-curtained room decorated with skeletons, two candles and a white circle on the ground. The very solemn performance would start with the sound of thunder that would grow louder and louder, accompanied by hail and wind. Lights would extinguish themselves one by one and flames would rise from the lamps before being extinguished and rendering the room in total darkness. Then ghosts of all sizes and shapes would fly around in a circle. After a very fierce storm a summoned, lifelike ghost of a person known to the audience would eventually rise from the floor to slowly sink back into the abyss in the ground. Ghosts would appear in various ways; one would suddenly be there, another would slowly shape itself from a grey cloud and yet another would approach from far away and come so close that one could touch it. Some apparitions would take a few steps closer to the audience before disappearing. Spectators were spared any annoyance of foul tastes or odors and could count on a pleasant experience. The show would start at seven in the evening and last one and a half hour. There would be three public performances a week and private shows for parties up to 24 people could be booked for the remaining days. One review stated that no optical or other tricks could be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Phylidor ''Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' flyer 1790&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wiener Zeitung''. 1790-03-13&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "review" could have been part of Phylidor's newspaper promotions: it is somewhat similar to advertisements and handbills that also described the show.

==="Phantasmagorie", Paris (December 1792 to July 1793)===
A "Phantasmagorie" by Paul Filidort in Paris was first advertised on 16 December 1792. It was several years into the [[French Revolution]] and the audience were particularly open to the idea of seeing their dead heroes.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;[http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/history/history7.html A History Of The Magic Lantern - Page 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009141024/http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/history/history7.html |date=2011-10-09 }} MagicLantern.org.uk. Accessed 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with tensions running high and Philidor's shows increasingly making political references it was not long until he found himself in trouble with the authorities. Philidor made references to well-known revolutionaries of the day, making [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Georges Danton]], and [[Jean-Paul Marat]] appear as if they were the devil.&lt;ref name="hoeveler"&gt;Long Hoeveler, Diane. [http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/gothic/hoeveler/hoeveler.html Smoke and Mirrors: Internalizing the Magic Lantern Show in Villette]. Accessed 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of Madame Tussaud, a "Monsieur Phillipstal" was arrested after the audience of a phanstasmagoria show protested at what they interpreted as a depiction of the rise of [[Louis XVI]] to heaven, caused by a mistake by an assistant who was removing the slide during projection. Phillipsthal's wife would have bribed authorities so he was released from prison. However, this may be only legend as also [[Étienne-Gaspard Robert|Robertson]] is associated with trouble after showing a slide of Louis XVI, which Tussaud might have read in Robertson's ''Mémoirs'' (1831-1833) and mixed-up with Philipsthal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://library.sdsu.edu/pdf/scua/ML_Gazette/MLGvol18no04.pdf|title=The Magic Lantern Gazette, Volume 18, Number 4|date=Winter 2006|last=Huhtamo|first=Erkki|pages=10–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batavian Republic (1798-1800)===
In 1798 "Phycisist" Phylidor exhibited his "Large Cabinet of Mechanical and Optical Arts" including ghostly apparitions and life-size mechanical figures in several cities of the Batavian Republic (now a large part of the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oprechte Haarlemse courant|date=1798-06-23|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010729569:mpeg21:a0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utrechtsche Courant|date=1798-07-11|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010728642:mpeg21:a0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Rotterdam during the summer of 1799 Phylidor advertised his cabinet to have considerably increased since the year before and especially mentions his peacock automaton, which ate and drank as if it were real. The performance took place in a tent in the Gebakken Pauwesteeg ("Baked Peacock Alley").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rotterdamse Courant]]''. 1799-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Groningen in 1800 "Physici Phylidor &amp; Compn." advertised their totally new wondrous mechanical and optical pieces of art, by candlelight and accompanied by music.&lt;ref&gt;''Groninger Courant''. 1800-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain (1801-1829)===
In October 1801 M. Philipsthal set up an exhibition of ''Phantasmagoria'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]].&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;[http://www.grand-illusions.com/articles/lantern_of_fear/page02.shtml The Lantern of Fear - Page 2] Grand-Illusions.com. Accessed 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a huge success and soon other showmen presented their versions of phantasmagoria. 

After a short break Philidor reopened his show with the wax museum of [[Marie Tussaud]] alongside. Tussaud had left France to join up with Philidor, who agreed to allow her to associate with his fame for half of her profits. She would go on to travel [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] until settling down for a permanent exhibition on [[Baker Street]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

Philipsthal would take his show to other large cities in Britain over the years.

Between May 1811 and April 1813 Philipsthal was joined by a mister Maillardet to exhibit the Royal Mechanical and Optical Museum in theatres in England. It consisted of their Musical Automatons, Mechanical Rope-Dancers, (as Large Life,) Singing Bird, and many other wonders.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Mercury, 13-04-1813&lt;/ref&gt;

Philipsthal gave his last shows with his Royal Mechanical and Optical Museum in February 1829 in Leeds&lt;ref&gt;Leeds Patriot and Yorkshire Advertiser, 21-02-1829&lt;/ref&gt;, a few weeks before his death.

'''Ranthambore Fort''' lies within the [[Ranthambore National Park]], near the town of [[Sawai Madhopur]], the park being the former hunting grounds of the [[Maharajah]]s of [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]] until the time of  [[Partition of India|India's Independence]]. It is a formidable fort having been a focal point of the historical developments of [[Rajasthan]]. The fort was held by the [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Chahamanas]] (Chauhans) until the 13th century, when the [[Delhi Sultanate]] captured it.

In 2013, at the 37th session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], Ranthambore Fort, along with 5 other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] under the group [[Hill Forts of Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/247/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=1947|title=UNESCO World Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=27 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Ranthambore fort was built by a Nagill [[Jat]] rulers, after few years when [[Chouhan]] Ruler capture this fort they do some changes although the exact name of the ruler is disputed. A widely held belief states that the fort was built the reign of Sapaldaksha, in 944 CE. Another theory states that the fort was built during the reign of Jayant, in 1110 CE. According to Government of Rajasthan's Amber Development &amp; Management Authority, it is likely that the construction started in the mid-10th century during the reign of Sapaldaksha, and continued a few centuries after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hillfortsrajasthan.nic.in/ranthambore-fort/history.html |title=Hill Forts of Rajasthan: Ranthambore |publisher=Amber Development &amp; Management Authority |accessdate=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Under Chauhans ===

Its earlier name was Ranastambha or Ranastambhapura. It was associated with [[Jainism]] during the reign of [[Prithviraja I]] of [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] (Chauhan) dynasty in the 12th century. Siddhasenasuri, who lived in the 12th century has included this place in the list of holy [[Jain]] tirthas. In Mughal period, a temple of Mallinatha was built in the fort.&lt;ref name="Singh2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Narendra|title=Encyclopaedia of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnJIIeHLB4sC&amp;pg=PA5538|volume=1|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Anmol Publications / Indo-European Jain Research Foundation|isbn=978-81-261-0691-2|page=5538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Prithviraja III]] (Prithviraj Chauhan) in 1192 CE, the fort came under the control of the Muslim [[Ghurid]] ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. Prithviraja's son [[Govindaraja IV]] accepted the Ghurid suzerainty, and ruled Ranthambore as his vassal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dasharatha Sharma |title=Early Chauhān Dynasties |publisher=S.

The Delhi Sultan [[Iltutmish]] captured Ranthambore in 1226, but the Chauhans recaptured it after his death in 1236. The armies of Sultan [[Nasir ud din Mahmud]], led by the future Sultan [[Balban]], unsuccessfully besieged the fortress in 1248 and 1253, but captured from Jaitrasingh Chauhan in 1259. Shakti Dev succeeded Jaitrasingh in 1283, and recaptured Ranthambore and enlarged the kingdom. Sultan [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji]] briefly besieged the fort in 1290-91. In 1299, [[Hammiradeva]] sheltered Muhammad Shah, a rebel general of Sultan [[Ala ud din Khalji]], and refused to turn him over to the Sultan. The Sultan [[Siege of Ranthambore (1301)|besieged and conquered]] the fort in 1301.

'''Sir Richard Baker''' (c. 1568 – 18 February 1645) was a politician, historian and religious writer.
He was the English author of the ''Chronicle of the Kings of England'' and other works.

==Family==
Richard Baker, born about 1568 at [[Sissinghurst]], Kent, was the elder son of [[John Baker (by 1531–1604/6)|John Baker]] and Katherine Scott, the daughter of Sir Reginald Scott (d. 16 December 1554) of [[Scot's Hall]] near [[Ashford, Kent]], and Emeline Kempe, the daughter of [[Sir William Kempe]] of [[Olantigh]], by Eleanor, daughter of Sir Robert Browne.{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=2}} Richard Baker's father, [[John Baker (by 1531–1604/6)|John Baker]], was the second son of [[John Baker (died 1558)|Sir John Baker]], the first [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].{{sfn|Martin|2004}}

Richard Baker had a younger brother named Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;christened on 3 April 1577 at [[St Stephen Coleman Street]], City of London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will of John Baker of Saint Stephen Coleman Street, City of London, 14 April 1606&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will of Sir Henry Baker of Cranbrook, Kent, 6 May 1624&lt;/ref&gt; who is doubtless the ancestor of William Baker of Lismacue House in [[County Tipperary]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"A genealogical and Heraldic History of The Landed Gentry", by Sir [[Bernard Burke]], revised by A.C Fox-Davies, published by Harrisons and Sons 1912, p.23, It stated incorrectly that William's ancestor Thomas was a follower of [[Henry Sidney|Lord Deputy Sussex]] instead of [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Lord Lieutenant Essex]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Baker entered [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hart Hall, Oxford]], as a commoner in 1584. He left the university without graduating, but was granted the degree of [[Master of Arts]] by decree in 1594, studied law in London, and afterwards travelled in [[mainland Europe]]. In 1593 he was chosen Member of Parliament for [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]], and in 1597 was elected to Parliament as the representative of [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]] as a nominee of [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]], his uncle.

In 1603 Baker was knighted by [[James I of England|King James I]] at [[Theobalds|Theobalds Palace]]. At the time he was living in [[Highgate]]. He held the office of [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Middlesex]]. In 1620 he was [[High Sheriff of Oxfordshire]], where he inherited the manor of [[Middle Aston]].

By making himself responsible for some debts of his wife's family he was reduced to great poverty, which led to the seizure of his Oxfordshire property in 1625. Penniless, he took refuge in the [[Fleet prison]] in 1635, and was still in confinement when he died 18 February 1645. He was buried in [[St Bride's Church]], [[Fleet Street]], London.

==Marriage and issue==
About 1600 Baker married Margaret Mainwaring (d.1654),&lt;ref&gt;Will of Dame Margaret Baker, widow, City of London, 9 February 1654&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[George Mainwaring (MP)|Sir George Mainwaring]] of [[Ightfield]], Shropshire, by whom he had three sons and four daughters:
*Sir Thomas Baker, born in 1602, who married on 9 April at St Mary in the parish of [[Lambeth]], Frances Wilford, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilford of Ileden, [[Kent]] and Elizabeth Sandys. They had eight children&lt;ref&gt;"The Oxinden Letters 1607–1642", Edited with Notes and an Introduction by Dorothy Gardiner, published by London Constable and Co ltd 1933, p.223-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mainwaring, born in 1603.
*Arthur (died in 1644), barrister at law.
*Anne, born in 1607.
*Margaret.
*Cecily.
*Frances, married on 18 October 1645 at [[St Anne and St Agnes]], London, Robert Smith, citizen and tailor of London. Smith is said to have burned a manuscript of Baker's life.

==Works==
During his imprisonment Baker spent his time mainly in writing. His chief work is the ''[[Baker's Chronicle|Chronicle of the Kings of England from the Time of the Romans' Government unto the Death of King James]]'' (1643, and many subsequent editions). It was translated into Dutch in 1649, and was continued down to 1658 by [[Edward Phillips]], a nephew of [[John Milton]], who became a strong Royalist. For many years the ''Chronicle'' was extremely popular, but owing to numerous inaccuracies its historical value is very slight.

Other writings:
*''Cato Variegatus or Catoes Morall Distichs, Translated and Paraphrased by Sir Richard Baker, Knight'' (London, 1636)
*''Meditations on the Lord's Prayer'' (1637)
*''Translation of New Epistles by Moonsieur D'Balzac'' (1638)
*''Apologie for Laymen's Writing in Divinity, with a Short Meditation upon the Fall of Lucifer'' (1641)
*''Motives for Prayer upon the seaven dayes of ye weeke'' (1642)
*a translation of [[Virgilio Malvezzi]]'s ''Discourses upon [[Cornelius Tacitus]]'' (1642)
*''Theatrum Redivivum, or The Theatre Vindicated, a reply to the Histrio-Mastix of [[William Prynne]]'' (1642).

Baker also wrote ''Meditations upon several of the psalms of David,'' which have been collected and edited by [[Alexander Grosart]] (London, 1882).

'''Rifa'a al-Tahtawi''' (also spelt '''Tahtawy'''; {{lang-ar|رفاعة رافع الطهطاوي}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Rifā‘ah Rāf‘i al-Ṭahṭāwī''; 1801&amp;ndash;1873) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer, teacher, translator, [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and renaissance intellectual. Tahtawi was among the first Egyptian scholars to write about Western cultures in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation and an understanding between Islamic and [[Christian civilization]]s. He founded the [[Faculty of Languages, Ain Shams University|School of Languages]] in 1835 and was influential in the development of science, law, literature and Egyptology in 19th-century Egypt. His work influenced that of many later scholars including [[Muhammad Abduh]].

==Background==

Tahtawi was born in 1801 in the village of [[Tahta]], Sohag, the same year the French troops evacuated Egypt. He was an [[Al-Azhar University|Azharite]] recommended by his teacher and mentor [[Hassan El-Attar]] to be the chaplain of a group of students [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]] was sending to Paris in 1826. Originally intended to be an [[Imam]], or Islamic "religious guide", he was allowed to associate with the other members of the mission through persuasion of his authoritative figures.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L., Bunton, Martin: ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', Westview Press, 2013, pp. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Many student missions from Egypt went to Europe in the early 19th century to study arts and sciences at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. According to his memoir ''Rihla'' (''Journey to Paris''), Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics and geometry. He read works by [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and [[Étienne Bézout|Bézout]] among others during his séjour in France.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, Tahtawi returned home to be part of the statewide effort to modernize the Egyptian infrastructure and education. He undertook a career in writing and translation, and founded the School of Languages (also knowns as ''School of Translators'') in 1835, which become part of [[Ain Shams University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alsun.asu.edu.eg//english/article.php?action=show&amp;id=7586#.VooiJfnhA0M Faculty of Al-Alsun: Historical background]&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Languages graduated the earliest modern Egyptian intellectual milieu, which formed the basis of the emerging grassroots mobilization against British colonialism in Egypt. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. They introduced his Egyptian audience to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or "good Egyptian"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 115-16&lt;/ref&gt; Tahtawi's work was the first effort in what became an Egyptian renaissance (''[[nahda]]'') that flourished in the years between 1860–1940.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Cairo]] in 1873.

==Muslim Modernity==
[[File:كتاب رفاعة الطهطاوي.jpg|thumbnail|Tahtawi agreement with his wife not to marry another woman اتفاق بين رفاعة الطهطاوى وزوجته التزم كاتب الأحرف رفاعة بدوي رافع لبنت خاله المصونة الحاجة كريمة بنت العلامة الشيخ محمد الفرغلي الأنصاري انه يبقى معها وحدها على الزوجية دون غيرها من زوجة أخرى أو جارية أياً ماكانت ، و علقت عصمتها على أخذ غيرها من نسا أو تمتع بجارية أخرى ، فإذا تزوج بزوجة أيا ما كانت ، كانت بنت خاله بمجرد العقد عليها خالصة بالثلاثة ، كذلك إذا تمتع بجارية ملك يمين ، و لكن وعدها وعدا صحيحاً لا ينتقض و لا ينحل انها ما دامت معه على المحبة المعهودة مقيمة على الأمانة و الحفظ لبيتها و لأولادها و لخدمها و جواريها ، ساكنة معه في محل سكناه ، لا يتزوج بغيرها أصلاً و لا يتمتع بجوار أصلاً ، و لا يخرجها من عصمته حتى يقضي الله لأحدهما بقضاء ، هذا ما انجعلت عليه العهود و شهد الله يبحانه و تعالى بذلك و ملايكته و رسله ، و إن فعل المذكور خلافه ، كان الله تعالى هو الوكيل العادل للزوجة المذكور يقتص لها منه في الدنيا و الآخرة ، هذا ما انجعل عليه الاتفاق ،و كذلك إن تعبته فهي الجانية على نفسهال]]
Tahtawi is considered one of the early adapters to [[Islamic Modernism]]. Islamic Modernists attempted to integrate Islamic principles with European social theories. In 1826, Al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris by Mehmet Ali. Tahtawi studied at an educational mission for five years, returning in 1831. Tahtawi was appointed director of the School of Languages. At the school, he worked translating European books into Arabic. Tahtawi was instrumental in translating military manuals, geography, and European history.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; In total, al-Tahtawi supervised the translation of over 2,000 foreign works into Arabic. Al-Tahtawi even made favorable comments about French society in some of his books.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L. (2008)"History of the Modern Middle East" (4th ed.) pg.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Tahtawi stressed that the Principles of Islam are compatible with those of European Modernity.

In his piece, ''The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris,'' Tahtawi discusses the patriotic responsibility of citizenship. Tahtawi uses Roman civilization as an example for what could become of Islamic civilizations. At one point all Romans are united under one Caesar but split into East and West. After splitting, the two nations see “all its wars ended in defeat, and it retreated from a perfect existence to nonexistence.”  Tahtawi understands that if Egypt is unable to remain united, it could fall prey to outside invaders. Tahtawi stresses the importance of citizens defending the patriotic duty of their country. One way to protect one's country according to Tahtawi, is to accept the changes that come with a modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Tahtawi, like others of what is often referred to as the 'Nahda' (Muslim Nahda), was spellbound and "seduced" by French (and Western in general) culture in his books. Shaden Tageldin has suggested that this produced an intellectual inferiority complex in his ideas that aided in an "intellectual colonization" that remains till today among Egyptian intelligentsia.&lt;ref&gt;Tageldin, Shaden. (2011). Disarming Words: Empire and the Seductions of Translation in Egypt. Berkeley: University of California Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''LeRoy Robert Ripley''' (December 25, 1890 – May 27, 1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/293/000113951/ |website=NNDb.com|title=Robert L. Ripley biography|accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[cartoonist]], [[entrepreneur]], and amateur [[anthropologist]] who is known for creating the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' newspaper panel series, radio show, and television show which feature odd facts from around the world.

Subjects covered in Ripley's cartoons and text ranged from sports feats to little-known facts about unusual and exotic sites. But what ensured the concept's popularity may have been that he also included items submitted by readers, who supplied photographs of a wide variety of small-town American trivia ranging from unusually shaped vegetables to oddly marked domestic animals, all documented by photographs and then depicted by his drawings.

==Biography==
In 1919 Ripley married [[Beatrice Roberts]]. He made his first trip around the world in 1922, delineating a [[travel literature|travel journal]] in installments. This ushered in a new topic for his cartoons: unusual and exotic foreign locales and cultures. Because he took the veracity of his work quite seriously, in 1923 he hired a researcher and [[polyglot]] named [[Norbert Pearlroth]] as a full-time assistant. In 1926 Ripley's feature moved from the ''New York Globe'' to the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Neal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/robert-ripley-believe-it-or-not |title=Robert Ripley: The Life and True Lies of Mr. Believe-It-Or-Not |magazine=Vanity Fair |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1920s, Ripley continued to broaden the scope of his work and his popularity increased greatly. He published both a travel journal and a guide to the game of [[Team handball|handball]] in 1925. In 1926, he became the New York State handball champion and also wrote a book on boxing. With a proven track record as a versatile writer and artist, he attracted the attention of publishing mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], who managed the [[King Features Syndicate]]. In 1929, Hearst was responsible for ''Believe It or Not!'' making its syndicated debut in seventeen papers worldwide. With the success of this series assured, Ripley capitalized on his fame by getting the first book collection of his newspaper panel series published.

On November 3, 1929, he drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon saying "Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizarremag.com/film-and-music/interviews/3120/robert_l_ripley.html Robert L. Ripley]. ''Bizarre Magazine''. February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the widespread belief that "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", with its lyrics by [[Francis Scott Key]] set to the music of the English drinking song "[[To Anacreon in Heaven]]", was the United States national anthem, Congress had never officially made it so. In 1931, [[John Philip Sousa]] published his opinion in favor of giving the song official status, stating that "it is the spirit of the music that inspires" as much as it is Key's "soul-stirring" words. By a law signed on March 3, 1931, by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]], "The Star-Spangled Banner" was adopted as the national anthem of the United States.

In the 1930s Ripley expanded his presence into other forms of media. In 1930, he began a fourteen-year run on radio and a nineteen-year association with the show's producer, Doug Storer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Ripleys PR |url=http://www.ripleysnewsroom.com/ripley-timeline |title=Company News - Ripley Entertainment Inc |website=Ripleysnewsroom.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for Ripley's celebrated travels around the world were provided by the Hearst organization, and he recorded live radio shows underwater and from the sky, the [[Carlsbad Caverns]], the bottom of [[The Grand Canyon]], snake pits, and foreign countries. The next year he hosted the first of a series of two dozen ''Believe It or Not!'' theatrical short films for [[Warner Bros.]] &amp; [[Vitaphone]], and King Features published a second collected volume of ''Believe it or Not!'' panels. He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, ''Seasons Greetings'' (1931), with [[Ruth Etting]], [[Joe Penner]], [[Ted Husing]], [[Thelma White]], [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], and others. After a trip to Asia in 1932, he opened his first museum, the [[Odditorium]], in [[Chicago]] in 1933. The concept was a success, and at one point there were Odditoriums in [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], [[Cleveland]], San Francisco, and New York City. By this point in his life, Ripley had been voted the most popular man in America by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rothstein, Edward |title=O, Believers, Prepare to Be Amazed! |date=August 24, 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]  |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/arts/design/24ripl.html |accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; received an honorary degree from [[Dartmouth College]], and visited 201 foreign countries.

During World War II, Ripley concentrated on charity pursuits rather than world travel, but after the war, he re-expanded his media efforts. In 1948, the year of the 20th anniversary of the ''Believe it or Not!'' cartoon series, the ''Believe it or Not!'' radio show drew to a close and was replaced with a ''Believe it or Not!'' television series. This was a rather bold move on Ripley's part because of the small number of Americans with access to television at this early time in the medium's development. He completed only thirteen episodes of the series before he became incapacitated by severe health problems. He reportedly passed out during the filming of his final show.{{Citation needed|reason=Reported by whom?|date=September 2017}}

His health worsened, and on May 27, 1949, at age 58, he succumbed to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in New York City. He was buried in his home town of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] in the [[Oddfellows Lawn Cemetery]], which is adjacent to the Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery.&lt;ref name=2015AmericanExperience&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: Ripley: Believe It or Not|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/introduction/ripley-introduction/|work=[[American Experience]]|publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The comic strip==
[[File:Pat mcdonald by Ripley cartoon.png|thumbnail|left|Early cartoon by Ripley, pre-"Believe It or Not," published in 1920. [[Pat McDonald (athlete)|Pat McDonald]], American Olympian.]]
Ripley's cartoon series was estimated to have 80&amp;nbsp;million readers worldwide, and it was said that he received more mail than the President of the United States. He became a wealthy man, with homes in New York and Florida, but he always retained close ties to his home town of Santa Rosa, California, and he made a point of bringing attention to The Church of One Tree, a church built entirely from the wood of a single 300-ft (91.4-m)-tall [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] tree, which stands on the north side of Juilliard Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

Ripley claimed to be able to "prove every statement he made" because he worked with professional fact researcher [[Norbert Pearlroth]], who assembled ''Believe it or Not!'''s array of odd facts and also verified the small-town claims submitted by readers. Pearlroth spent 52 years as the feature's researcher, finding and verifying unusual facts for Ripley and, after Ripley's death, for the King Features syndicate editors who took over management of the ''Believe it or Not!'' panel.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Another employee who edited the newspaper cartoon series over the years was Lester Byck. Others who drew the series after Ripley's death include Don Wimmer; Joe Campbell (1946-1956); Art Slogg; Clem Gretter (1941-1949); Carl Dorese; Bob Clarke (1943-1944); Stan Randall; [[Paul Frehm]] (1938–1975), who became the panel's full-time artist in 1949; and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Legacy==
Ripley's ideas and legacy live on in [[Ripley Entertainment]], a company bearing his name and owned since 1985 by the [[Jim Pattison Group]], Canada's largest privately held company. Ripley Entertainment airs national television shows, features publications of oddities, and has holdings in a variety of public attractions, including Ripley's Aquarium, Ripley's Believe it or Not! Museums, Ripley's Haunted Adventure, Ripley's Mini-Golf and Arcade, Ripley's Moving Theater, Ripley's Sightseeing Trains, Guinness World Records Attractions, and Louis Tussaud's wax Museums.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Roger W. Moss''' (born January 31, 1940) is an [[historian]], [[educator]], administrator and [[author]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Throughout a long career he has also been an aggressive and entrepreneurial advocate for the preservation and authentic restoration of historic buildings.  For forty years Moss directed the [[Athenaeum of Philadelphia]], a special collections library near Independence Hall, and for 25 of those years he also taught in the Graduate Program in Historic Preservation at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Early years==

'''Roger William Moss''' was born and raised in [[Zanesville, Ohio]], the only child of Roger William and Dorothy Elizabeth Martin Moss.  He received his B.S.Ed and M.A. degrees from [[Ohio University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio University Alumni Directory'' (Athens, Ohio, 2002), p. 821.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the summer of 1962 he was an assistant to the director of the [[Peace Corps]] staff preparing the first team destined for the [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Moss, ''Athenaeum Profiles: A Not-for-Profit Education'' (New Castle, DE, Oak Knoll, 2014), pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  While pursuing his Master of Arts degree he was curator of rare books at [[Ohio University Library]] which resulted in his first publications.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Roger W. Moss, ''The Morgan Collection in the History of Chemistry at Ohio University," ''Ohioiana (Winter, 1964), pp. 136-137.  Roger W. Moss, ''Morgan Collection in the History of Chemistry: A Checklist,'' (Athens, Ohio, Ohio University Press, 1965.) ''Athenaeum Profiles, pp. 9-14. Aaron J. Ihde, ''The Morgan Collection,'' ''Journal of Chemical Education'' (August, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964 Moss accepted a teaching fellowship from [[The University of Delaware]] leading to his Ph.D. with a major in early American history and a minor in American Material Culture at [[Winterthur Museum]].  During the summer of 1966 he studied English country houses and collections as an [[Attingham Trust]] Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Beard, ''Attingham: The First Forty Years, 1952-1991"" London, Attingham Trust, 1991, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the academic year 1967-68 he was an adjunct lecturer in history for the [[University of Delaware]] and the [[University of Maryland]] extension programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Athenaeum Profiles", p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Philadelphia==

In 1968 Moss became the Executive Director of [[The Athenæum of Philadelphia]], a member-supported library founded in 1814 and housed in a National Historic Landmark building near Independence Hall.  During his four-decade tenure there he restored and expanded the building&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Moss, ''Philadelphia Victorian: The Building of The Athenæum" (Philadelphia, PA: The Athenæum of Philadelphia, 1998)  "The Athenæum of Philadelphia," "The Magazine Antiques" (December 1978), CXIV, 1264-1279.&lt;/ref&gt; and reorganized the nearly moribund institution as an independent research library specializing in American architecture prior to 1930 and nineteenth-century material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wendorf (ed.), ''American Membership Libraries'' (Newark, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 2007), pp. 131-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction the research collections in architecture and Victorian-era design rapidly expanded, including the acquisition of the archives of numerous major American architects ranging from [[Thomas Ustick Walter]] (1804-1887) to [[Paul Philippe Cret (1876-1945)]].&lt;ref&gt;Nessa Forman, "The Grand Acquisitors," The Bulletin (Philadelphia, November 19, 1978).  Roger W. Moss, "Collecting Architectural Drawings," Antiquarian Bookman (Clifton, NJ, AB Bookman, 1985), pp. 1637-1641. Architectural Collections: The Athenæum of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA: The Athenæum of Philadelphia, 1990. Roger W. Moss, Collecting Architecture: A Quarter Century of Collecting Architectural Graphics, 1975-2000 (Philadelphia Athenæum, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Moss became a trustee of the [[Christopher Ludwick Foundation]], one of Philadelphia's oldest philanthropic institutions founded in 1799 to advance the education of the poor children of Philadelphia.  He would serve the foundation as an officer or trustee for forty-six years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ludwickfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

When The [[Victorian Society in America]] was founded in 1966, Moss became an early board member and officer.  He also capitalized on the explosion of popular interest in Victorian architecture and design in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hine, "Victoriana, Those Many Years of 'Ughs' Have Been Giving Way to 'Ahs!" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (May 22, 1986).  Maryann Ondovcsiki, "A Passion for Victoriana: The Victorian Society in America," ''Traditional Homes'' (Spring, 1987), pp.61-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his first steps was to invite the Victorian Society to establish its national office at the Athenæum which provided a base for the infant society and both national and international visibility for the Athenæum.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Seltzer, "Supersonic Note: Victorians Here," ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (October 9, 1969).  Ruth Seltzer, "Sideburns, Beards on Victorian Walk," ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (November 11, 1969).  Eileen P. Birk, "Current and Coming," ''The Magazine Antiques,'' (December, 1969) XCVI, p. 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Moss also proved to be an aggressive collector with remarkable fund raising ability, particularly for the acquisition, conservation, proper housing, and exhibition of architectural records, securing major grants from national, state, and local foundations for those purposes.  He also doubled the membership and raised substantial sums to endow the building, staff positions, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;The Athenæum of Philadelphia, ''Annual Reports,'' 1969-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 Moss launched a publication series to reprint rare Victorian design sources from the Athenæum collection, beginning with ''Exterior Decoration: A Treatise on the Artistic Use of Colors in the Ornamentation of Buildings'' originally published in 1885 by the Devoe Paint Company [[www.1754Paint.com]] complete with large color plates and authentic paint samples.  This reprint became a seminal influence in the nationwide movement to preserve, restore, and authentically repaint Victorian-era buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Keith N. Morgan, ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' 37:1 (March, 1978), pp. 52-53.  Ron Avery, "A Classic Library's Legacy: Athenæum Revives the 19th Century, ''Philadelphia Daily News'' (September 6, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973 Moss was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]], London, England.

Moss has been well known in [[historic preservation]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] for several decades. He has taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the historic preservation program since 1981.  His works at the Athenaeum of Philadelphia since 1968 include restoration of the institution's building, and amassing a significant collection of historic [[architectural drawing]]s and photographs for its library. He has written numerous books and articles.

One of his most influential contributions to preservationists and architects working in the field may be his landmark books on historic American [[paint]]s and [[color]]s.  His investigations led to the creation of the first full line of historic paint colors produced by [[Sherwin-Williams Paints]], the American paint manufacturer.

'''Shalimar''' is a [[perfume]] originally created by [[Jacques Guerlain]] in 1921 and currently produced by [[Guerlain]].&lt;ref name="Iconic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pellen|first1=Guenola|title=Iconic: Shalimar, the Perfume of the Roaring Twenties|url=https://france-amerique.com/objet-culte-shalimar-le-parfum-des-annees-folles/|website=France-Amerique|publisher=France-Amerique|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shalimar was created by [[Jacques Guerlain]] in 1921, but after another company claimed to already have a fragrance by the same name, Guerlain was forced to rename the fragrance "No. 90" until a legal dispute over the name was settled.&lt;ref name="Industrial"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shalimar de Guerlain: Discover This Vintage Fragrance|url=http://vintageindustrialstyle.com/shalimar-guerlain-discover-vintage-fragrance/|website=Vintage Industrial Style|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shalimar was re-released in 1925 at the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]].&lt;ref name="Industrial" /&gt;

Jacques Guerlain was inspired by [[Mumtaz Mahal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Guerlain/Shalimar-53.html Shalimar] ''fragrantica'' accessed 12/4/2014&lt;/ref&gt; the woman for whom the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] and the [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Gardens]] in [[Lahore]] were built.&lt;ref name="perfumeintelligence1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfumeintelligence.co.uk/library/perfume/s/s3/s3p3.htm |title=The Encyclopaedia of Perfume |publisher=Perfume Intelligence |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harmony of Shalimar was created when Jacques Guerlain poured a bottle of [[ethylvanillin]] into a bottle of [[Jicky]], a fragrance created by Guerlain in 1889.&lt;ref name="Iconic" /&gt;

[[Raymond Guerlain]] designed the bottle for Shalimar, which was modeled after the basins of eastern gardens and Mongolian stupa art. Shalimar's blue, fan-shaped bottle topper was inspired by a piece of silverware owned by the Guerlain family.The bottle was manufactured by [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat Crystal]] and received the International Decorative Arts Exhibition Award in 1925.&lt;ref name="Iconic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godin|first1=Virginie|title=Getting to Know the Oldest Fragrances on the Market|url=http://www.osmoz.com/inspiration/questions-selections/211/getting-to-know-the-oldest-fragrances-on-the-market|website=Osmoz|accessdate=9 January 2018|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, Shalimar was popular with [[flapper]]s which helped give it a "bad girl" reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best in Show: Shalimar by Guerlain (2017)|url=https://www.fragrantica.com/news/Best-in-Show-Shalimar-by-Guerlain-2017--10385.html|website=Fragrantica|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Shalimar was repackaged and presented encased in a Lucite box to commemorate the 60th anniversary of its original launch.&lt;ref name="perfumeintelligence1"/&gt; In 2004, Guerlain issued Shalimar Light by perfumer [[Mathilde Laurent]]. However, Shalimar Light was taken off the market and replaced by  Eau de Shalimar in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr |first=Chandler |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/scent-notes-eau-de-shalimar-by-guerlain/ |title=Scent Notes &amp;#124; Eau de Shalimar by Guerlain - NYTimes.com |publisher=nytimes.com |date= 2008-03-13|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalimar is preserved in its original 1925 formulation in the archives of the [[Osmothèque]], donated by [[Jean-Paul Guerlain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmotheque.fr/ Osmothèque - Conservatoire international des parfums. Official website. Web. 18 June 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, Shalimar was Guerlain's second best selling fragrance, behind La Petite Robe Noire, with approximately 108 bottles being sold every hour.&lt;ref name="Iconic" /&gt;

==Scent==
The fragrance contains notes of [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[lemon]], [[Iris (plant)|iris]], [[jasmine]], [[rose]], [[patchouli]], [[vetiver]], [[opopanax]], [[tonka bean]], [[frankincense]], [[sandalwood]], [[musk]], [[civet]], [[ambergris]], [[leather]], and [[ethylvanillin|vanilla]]. It is considered to be an Oriental perfume (see [[Fragrance wheel|Fragrance Wheel]]).&lt;ref name="basenotes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basenotes.net/ID10211632.html |title=Shalimar by Guerlain (1925) - Basenotes Fragrance Directory |publisher=Basenotes.net |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Teotihuacán''''') ({{IPA-es|teotiwa'kan|-|TeotihuacanPronunciation.ogg}}, {{audio|Teotiwakan.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}), is an ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n city located in a sub-valley of the [[Valley of Mexico]], located in the [[State of Mexico]] {{convert|40|km|mi}} northeast of modern-day [[Mexico City]], known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant [[Mesoamerican pyramids]] built in the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]].

At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the 1st millennium [[Common Era|CE]], Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more,&lt;ref name="Teotihuacan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millon, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; making it at least the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Millon, p. 17, who says it was the sixth largest city in the world in AD 600.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead and its vibrant [[mural]]s that have been well-preserved. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine [[obsidian]] tools that are found throughout Mesoamerica. The city is thought to have been established around 100 [[Before Common Era|BCE]], with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE.&lt;ref name="Teotihuacan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/teot/hd_teot.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Department of Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE.

Teotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Highlands around the first century CE. It became the largest and most populated center in the pre-Columbian Americas. Teotihuacan was home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate the large population.&lt;ref name="Teotihuacan" /&gt; The term Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacano) is also used for the whole civilization and cultural complex associated with the site.

Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of a state empire, its influence throughout [[Mesoamerica]] is well documented; evidence of Teotihuacano presence can be seen at numerous sites in [[Veracruz]] and the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|Maya region]]. The later [[Aztecs]] saw these magnificent ruins and claimed a common ancestry with the Teotihuacanos, modifying and adopting aspects of their culture. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is the subject of debate. Possible candidates are the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]] or [[Totonac]] ethnic groups. Scholars have suggested that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic state.

The city and the archaeological site are located in what is now the [[San Juan Teotihuacán]] [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the [[Mexico (state)|State of México]], approximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} northeast of [[Mexico City]]. The site covers a total surface area of {{convert|83|km2|sqmi}} and was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/414|title=Pre-Hispanic City of Teotihuacan|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most visited archaeological site in Mexico, receiving 4,185,017 visitors in 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estadística de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name ''Teōtīhuacān'' was given by the [[Classical Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]-speaking [[Aztec]]s centuries after the fall of the city around 550 CE. The term has been [[Gloss (transliteration)|glossed]] as "birthplace of the gods", or "place where gods were born",&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology of Native North America by Dean R. Snow.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] creation myths that were said to occur in Teotihuacan. Nahuatl scholar [[Thelma D. Sullivan]] interprets the name as "place of those who have the road of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Millon (1993), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the Aztecs believed that the gods created the universe at that site. The name is pronounced {{IPA-nah|te.oːtiːˈwakaːn|}} in [[Nahuatl]], with the accent on the syllable ''wa''. By normal Nahuatl orthographic conventions, a written accent would not appear in that position. Both this pronunciation and {{IPA-es|te.otiwaˈkan}} are used, and both spellings appear in this article.

The original name of the city is unknown, but it appears in [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] from the Maya region as ''puh'', or "Place of Reeds".&lt;ref&gt;Mathews and Schele (1997, p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that, in the [[Maya civilization]] of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic]] period, Teotihuacan was understood as a Place of Reeds similar to other [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] Central Mexican settlements that took the name of ''[[Tollan]]'', such as ''[[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula-Hidalgo]]'' and ''[[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]''.

This naming convention led to much confusion in the early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles. It now seems clear that ''Tollan'' may be understood as a generic Nahua term applied to any large settlement. In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, ''Tollan'' and other language equivalents serve as a [[metaphor]], linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the [[Lake|lacustrine]] environment of the [[Valley of Mexico]] and the large gathering of people in a city.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p. 170)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and foundation===
[[File:Classic sites 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Teotihuacan and other important Classic Era settlements]]

The early history of Teotihuacan is quite mysterious and the origin of its founders is uncertain.   Around 300 BCE, people of the central and southeastern area of Mesoamerica began to gather into larger settlements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart Volume 1 Concise Edition|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = New York|pages = 292|last2 = Rosenberg|first2 = Clifford|last3 = Tignor|first3 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teotihuacan was the largest urban center of Mesoamerica before the Aztecs, almost 1000 years prior to their epoch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The city was already in ruins by the time of the Aztecs. For many years, archaeologists believed it was built by the [[Toltec]]. This belief was based on colonial period texts, such as the [[Florentine Codex]], which attributed the site to the Toltecs. However, the Nahuatl word "Toltec" generally means "craftsman of the highest level" and may not always refer to the Toltec civilization centered at [[Tula, Hidalgo]]. Since Toltec civilization flourished centuries after Teotihuacan, the people could not have been the city's founders.

In the Late Formative era, a number of urban centers arose in central Mexico. The most prominent of these appears to have been [[Cuicuilco]], on the southern shore of [[Lake Texcoco]]. Scholars have speculated that the eruption of the [[Xitle]] volcano may have prompted a mass emigration out of the central valley and into the Teotihuacan valley. These settlers may have founded or accelerated the growth of Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secrets of the Dead]], episode ''Teotihuacan's Lost Kings'', PBS, 30 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have put forth the [[Totonac]] people as the founders of Teotihuacan. There is evidence that at least some of the people living in Teotihuacan immigrated from those areas influenced by the Teotihuacano civilization, including the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] peoples. The builders of Teotihuacan took advantage of the geography in the Basin of Mexico. From the swampy ground, they constructed raised beds, called chinampas, creating high agricultural productivity despite old methods of cultivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allowed for the formation of channels, and subsequently canoe traffic, to transport food from farms around the city. The earliest buildings at Teotihuacan date to about 200 BCE. The largest pyramid, the [[Pyramid of the Sun]], was completed by 100 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Millon (1993), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year 378: "Conquest" of Tikal===
In January 378, while [[Spearthrower Owl]] supposedly ruled in Teotihuacan, the warlord [[Siyah K'ak']] "conquered" [[Tikal]], removing and replacing the Maya king, with support from [[El Perú (Maya site)|El Peru]] and [[Naachtun]], as recorded by Stela 31 at Tikal and other monuments in the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://decipherment.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/naachtuns-stela-24-and-the-entrada-of-378/ Naachtun’s Stela 24 and the Entrada of 378, David Stuart, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year 426: "Conquest" of Copán and Quiriguá===
In 426, the [[Copán]] ruling dynasty was created with [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']] as the first king. The Dynasty went on to have sixteen rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=JhivGOEv9D8C&amp;pg=PT396&amp;lpg=PT396&amp;dq=In+426,+K'inich+Yax+K'uk'+Mo'+takes+over+as+king+of+Cop%C3%A1n+in+present-day+Honduras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XkFKrNmqHy&amp;sig=-YhMHkLmcrXi9NRQSWFzecxQkxM&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20426,%20K'inich%20Yax%20K'uk'%20Mo'%20takes%20over%20as%20king%20of%20Cop%C3%A1n%20in%20present-day%20Honduras&amp;f=false|title=Honduras and the Bay Islands|last=Fiallos|first=Maria|date=2006|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=9781588436023|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copán is located in modern-day Honduras, as described by [[Copán Altar Q]](???).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=WAxZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=In+426,+K'inich+Yax+K'uk'+Mo'+takes+over+as+king+of+Cop%C3%A1n+in+present-day+Honduras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wIXsy_ft5f&amp;sig=jEJVVP0jCm-oGz1y3Ha7TUJ9Wdc&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20426,%20K'inich%20Yax%20K'uk'%20Mo'%20takes%20over%20as%20king%20of%20Cop%C3%A1n%20in%20present-day%20Honduras&amp;f=false|title=The Legacy of Mesoamerica: History and Culture of a Native American Civilization|last=Carmack|first=Robert M.|last2=Gasco|first2=Janine L.|last3=Gossen|first3=Gary H.|date=2016-01-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317346791|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon thereafter, Yax K'uk' Mo' installed [[Tok Casper]] as king of [[Quiriguá]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km north of Copán.

===Zenith===
The city reached its peak in 450 CE, when it was the center of a powerful culture whose influence extended through much of the Mesoamerican region. At its peak, the city covered over 30&amp;nbsp;km² (over {{frac|11|1|2}} square miles), and perhaps housed a population of 150,000 people, with one estimate reaching as high as 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malmström (1978, p. 105) gives an estimate of 50,000 to 200,000 inhabitants. Coe ''et al.'' (1986) says it "might lie between 125,000 and 250,000". Millon, p. 18, lists 125,000 in AD 600. Taube, p. 1, says "perhaps as many as 150,000".&lt;/ref&gt; Various districts in the city housed people from across the Teotihuacano region of influence, which spread south as far as [[Guatemala]]. Notably absent from the city are fortifications and military structures.

[[File:Piramide de la Luna 072006.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the [[Pyramid of the Moon]] from the [[Pyramid of the Sun]]]]

The nature of political and cultural interactions between Teotihuacan and the centers of the Maya region (as well as elsewhere in Mesoamerica) has been a long-standing and significant area for debate. Substantial exchange and interaction occurred over the centuries from the Terminal Preclassic to the Mid-Classic period. "Teotihuacan-inspired ideologies" and motifs persisted at Maya centers into the Late Classic, long after Teotihuacan itself had declined.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell (2003, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars debate the extent and degree of Teotihuacano influence. Some believe that it had direct and militaristic dominance; others that adoption of "foreign" traits was part of a selective, conscious, and bi-directional [[cultural diffusion]]. New discoveries have suggested that Teotihuacan was not much different in its interactions with other centers from the later empires, such as the Toltec and Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0610/feature5/index.html|title=Mexico's Pyramid of Death|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2006|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041203084345.htm|title=Sacrificial Burial Deepens Mystery At Teotihuacan, But Confirms The City's Militarism|publisher=[[ScienceDaily]]|date=2004|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Teotihuacan had a major influence on the Preclassic and Classic Maya, most likely by conquering several Maya centers and regions, including Tikal and the region of Peten, and influencing Maya culture.

[[File:MW-Teotihuacan8.jpg|thumb|Platform along the Avenue of the Dead showing the ''[[talud-tablero]]'' architectural style]]
[[File:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuacán).jpg|thumb|Restored portion of Teotihucan architecture showing the typical Mesoamerican use of red paint complemented on gold and jade decoration upon marble and granite.]]

Architectural styles prominent at Teotihuacan are found widely dispersed at a number of distant Mesoamerican sites, which some researchers have interpreted as evidence for Teotihuacan's far-reaching interactions and political or militaristic dominance.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Cheek (1977, ''passim.''), who argues that much of Teotihuacan's influence stems from direct militaristic conquest.&lt;/ref&gt; A style particularly associated with Teotihuacan is known as ''[[talud-tablero]]'', in which an inwards-sloping external side of a structure (''talud'') is surmounted by a rectangular panel (''tablero''). Variants of the generic style are found in a number of Maya region sites, including [[Tikal]], [[Kaminaljuyu]], [[Copan]], [[Becan]], and [[Oxkintok]], and particularly in the [[Petén Basin]] and the central Guatemalan highlands.&lt;ref&gt;See Laporte (2003, p. 205); Varela Torrecilla and Braswell (2003, p. 261).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''talud-tablero'' style pre-dates its earliest appearance at Teotihuacan in the Early Classic period; it appears to have originated in the [[Tlaxcala-Puebla]] region during the Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell (2003, p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses have traced the development into local variants of the ''talud-tablero'' style at sites such as Tikal, where its use precedes the 5th-century appearance of iconographic motifs shared with Teotihuacan. The ''talud-tablero'' style disseminated through Mesoamerica generally from the end of the Preclassic period, and not specifically, or solely, via Teotihuacano influence. It is unclear how or from where the style spread into the Maya region. During the zenith main structures of the site, including the pyramids, were painted in dark-red ([[maroon]] to [[Burgundy (color)|Burgundy]]) colors (only small spots remain now) and were a very impressionable view.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell (2003, p. 11); for the analysis at Tikal, see Laporte (2003, pp. 200–205)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was a center of industry, home to many potters, jewelers, and craftsmen. Teotihuacan is known for producing a great number of [[obsidian]] artifacts. No ancient Teotihuacano non-[[ideogram|ideographic]] texts are known to exist (or known to have existed). Inscriptions from Maya cities show that Teotihuacan nobility traveled to, and perhaps conquered, local rulers as far away as [[Honduras]]. [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]] note an individual nicknamed by scholars as "[[Spearthrower Owl]]", apparently ruler of Teotihuacan, who reigned for over 60 years and installed his relatives as rulers of [[Tikal]] and [[Uaxactun]] in [[Guatemala]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Scholars have based interpretations about the culture at Teotihuacan on archaeology, the murals that adorn the site (and others, like the [[Wagner Murals]], found in private collections), and hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors. The creation of murals, perhaps tens of thousands of murals, reached its height between 450 and 650.

Scholars had thought that invaders attacked the city in the 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the [[ruling class]].&lt;ref name = "Manz1"&gt;Linda R. Manzanilla. [http://www.pnas.org/content/112/30/9210.full Cooperation and tensions in multiethnic corporate societies using Teotihuacan, Central Mexico, as a case study], ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] (PNAS/PNAS Online)'', July 28, 2015, vol. 112 no. 30 (2015), pp. 9210–9215, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1419881112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. They say the invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. The sculptures inside palatial structures, such as Xalla, were shattered.&lt;ref&gt;Manzanilla L. (2003) The abandonment of Teotihuacan. The Archaeology of Settlement Abandonment in Middle America, Foundations of Archaeological Inquiry, eds Inomata T, Webb RW (Univ of Utah Press, Salt Lake City), pp 91–101/&lt;/ref&gt; No traces of foreign invasion are visible at the site.&lt;ref name = "Manz1"/&gt;

Evidence for population decline beginning around the 6th century lends some support to the internal unrest hypothesis. The decline of Teotihuacan has been correlated to lengthy [[droughts]] related to the [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|climate changes of 535–536]]. This theory of ecological decline is supported by archaeological remains that show a rise in the percentage of juvenile skeletons with evidence of [[malnutrition]] during the 6th century. Which is why there is different evidence that helps indicate that famine is most likely one of the more possible reasons for the decline of Teotihuacan. The majority of their food came from agriculture, they grew things such as maize, bean, amaranth, green tomatoes(tomatillos?), and pumpkin. But their harvest was not nearly sufficient to feed a population as big as it is believed lived in Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historiacultural.com/2010/10/cultura-teotihuacana.html|title=Cultura Teotihuacana|website=www.historiacultural.com|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding does not conflict with either of the above theories, since both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman (2001, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Other nearby centers such as [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], [[Xochicalco]], and [[Cacaxtla]] competed to fill the power void left by Teotihuacan's decline. They may have aligned themselves against Teotihuacan to reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites emulate Teotihuacan forms, but also demonstrate an eclectic mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The sudden destruction of Teotihuacan was common for Mesoamerican city-states of the Classic and Epi-Classic period. Many Maya states suffered similar fates in the coming centuries, a series of events often referred to as the [[Classic Maya collapse]]. Nearby in the Morelos valley, Xochicalco was sacked and burned in 900 and Tula met a similar fate around 1150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean R.|title=Archaeology of Native North America|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a theory&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Kingdoms of Central America'', [[BBC Four]] (British television, Saturday 28 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; that the collapse of Teotihuacan was caused by its agriculture being devastated by the 535 CE eruption of [[Lake Ilopango|the Ilopango volcano]] in [[El Salvador]].

==Culture==

[[File:Incensario Lid,Teotihuacan style, 400-700 C.E.,75.148.jpg|thumbnail|''Incensario Lid'', Teotihuacan style, 400–700 CE, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic city, with distinct quarters occupied by [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Nahua peoples]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The [[Totonac]]s have always maintained that they were the ones who built it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Aztecs repeated that story, but it has not been corroborated by archaeological findings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2001, [[Terrence Kaufman]] presented linguistic evidence suggesting that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]] or [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoquean]] linguistic affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/anthro/maldp/Nawa.pdf Terrence Kaufman, "Nawa linguistic prehistory"], SUNY Albany&lt;/ref&gt; He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe–Zoquean languages in many other [[Mesoamerican languages]], whose people did not have any known history of contact with either of the above-mentioned groups. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity, because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan both before and after the Classic period and not during the middle period.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |author=Wright Carr |author2=David Charles |date=2005 |title=El papel de los otomies en las culturas del altiplano central 5000 a.C - 1650 d.C|journal=[[Arqueología mexicana]] |volume=XIII |issue=73 |pages=19|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
In ''An Illustrated Dictionary of the Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya'', Miller and Taube list eight deities:&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Storm God&lt;ref&gt;Instead of "Storm God", Miller and Taube call this deity "[[Tlaloc]]", the name of the much later Aztec storm god. Coe (1994), p. 101, uses the same term. However, the use of [[Nahuatl]] Aztec names to denote Teotihuacan deities has been in decline (see Berlo, p. 147).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Great Goddess
* The [[Feathered Serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Instead of "the Feathered Serpent", Miller and Taube call this deity "[[Quetzalcoatl]]", the name of the much later Aztec feathered serpent god.&lt;/ref&gt; An important deity in Teotihuacan; most closely associated with the [[Feathered Serpent Pyramid]] (Temple of the Feathered Serpent).
* The Old God
* The War Serpent. Taube has differentiated two different serpent deities whose depictions alternate on the Feathered Serpent Pyramid: the Feathered Serpent and what he calls the "War Serpent". Other researchers are more skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama (1992), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Netted Jaguar
* The [[Pulque]] God
* The Fat God. Known primarily from figurines and so assumed to be related to household rituals.&lt;ref name = "Pasztory 1997, p. 84"&gt;Pasztory (1997), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Esther Pasztory adds one more:&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1997), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Flayed God. Known primarily from figurines and so assumed to be related to household rituals.&lt;ref name = "Pasztory 1997, p. 84" /&gt;

[[Image:Great Goddess of Teotihuacan (T Aleto).jpg|right|thumb|300px|A mural showing what has been identified as the [[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan]]]]

The consensus among scholars is that the primary deity of Teotihuacan was the [[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowgill (1997), p. 149. Pasztory (1992), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant civic architecture is the pyramid. Politics were based on the state religion; religious leaders were the political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious leaders would commission artists to create religious artworks for ceremonies and rituals.The artwork likely commissioned would have been a mural or a [[censer]] depicting gods like the [[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan]] or the [[Feathered Serpent]]. [[Censer|Censers]] would be lit during religious rituals to invoke the gods including rituals with [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teotihuacan : art from the city of the gods|last=Manzanilla|first=Linda|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=1993|isbn=0500277672|editor-last=Berrin|editor-first=Kathleen|location=New York, New York|pages=95|editor-last2=Pasztory|editor-first2=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teotihuacanos practiced [[human sacrifice]]: human bodies and animal sacrifices have been found during excavations of the pyramids at Teotihuacan. Scholars believe that the people offered human sacrifices as part of a dedication when buildings were expanded or constructed. The victims were probably enemy warriors captured in battle and brought to the city for ritual sacrifice to ensure the city could prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some men were decapitated, some had their hearts removed, others were killed by being hit several times over the head, and some were buried alive. Animals that were considered sacred and represented mythical powers and military were also buried alive, imprisoned in cages: cougars, a wolf, eagles, a falcon, an owl, and even venomous snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama: 109, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous stone masks have been found at Teotihuacan, and have been generally believed to have been used during a funerary context,&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|author=Birmingham Museum of Art|author-link=Birmingham Museum of Art|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|date=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location= Birmingham, AL |isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 |page =83|url= http://artsbma.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars call this into question, noting that masks "do not seem to have come from burials".&lt;ref&gt;Pasztory (1993), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
Teotihuacan was a mix of residential and work areas. Upper-class homes were usually compounds that housed many such families, and one compound was found that was capable of housing between sixty and eighty families. Such superior residences were typically made of plaster, each wall in every section elaborately decorated with murals. These compounds or apartment complexes were typically found within the city center. The vast lakes of the Basin of Mexico provided the opportunity for people living around them to construct productive raised beds, or chinampas, from swampy muck, construction that also produced channels between the beds.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Different sections of the city housed particular ethnic groups and immigrants. Typically, multiple languages were spoken in these sections of the city.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Archaeological site==
Knowledge of the huge [[ruins]] of Teotihuacan was never completely lost. After the fall of the city, various squatters lived on the site. During Aztec times, the city was a place of pilgrimage and identified with the myth of Tollan, the place where the sun was created. Today, Teotihuacan is one of the most noted archaeological attractions in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Excavations and investigations===
[[File:SunPyramid.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Pyramid of the Sun and the Teotihuacán Diorama at the Teotihuacán Museum.]]

In the late 17th century [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]] (1645–1700) made some excavations around the Pyramid of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907021755/http://www.milenio.com/node/501242 Tunnel under Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent under exploration in 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Minor archaeological excavations were conducted in the 19th century. In 1905 Mexican archaeologist and government official, in the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]], [[Leopoldo Batres]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Leopoldo Batres|es:Leopoldo Batres]]&lt;/ref&gt; led a major project of excavation and restoration. The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1910. The site of Teotihuacan was the first to be expropriated for the national patrimony under the Law of Monuments (1897), giving jurisdiction under legislation for the Mexican state to take control. Some 250 plots were farmed on the site. Peasants who had been farming portions were ordered to leave and the Mexican government eventually paid some compensation to those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins'', pp. 80, 192–95,&lt;/ref&gt; A feeder train line was built to the site in 1908, which allowed the efficient hauling of material from the excavations and later to bring tourists to the site.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins'', pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, the [[International Congress of Americanists]] met in Mexico, coinciding with the centennial celebrations, and the distinguished delegates, such as its president [[Eduard Seler]] and vice president [[Franz Boas]] were taken to the newly finished excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins'', 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further excavations at the ''Ciudadela'' were carried out in the 1920s, supervised by [[Manuel Gamio]]. Other sections of the site were excavated in the 1940s and 1950s. The first site-wide project of restoration and excavation was carried out by [[INAH]] from 1960 to 1965, supervised by [[Jorge R. Acosta|Jorge Acosta]]. This undertaking had the goals of clearing the Avenue of the Dead, consolidating the structures facing it, and excavating the Palace of ''[[Quetzalpapalotl]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

During the installation of a "sound and light" show in 1971, workers discovered the entrance to a tunnel and cave system underneath the Pyramid of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Heyden (1975, p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars long thought this to be a natural cave, more recent examinations have established the tunnel was entirely manmade.&lt;ref&gt;Šprajc (2000), p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the Pyramid of the Sun has never been fully excavated.

In 1980-82, another major program of excavation and restoration was carried out at the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent and the Avenue of the Dead complex. Most recently, a series of excavations at the Pyramid of the Moon have greatly expanded evidence of cultural practices.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Recent discoveries====

In late 2003 a tunnel beneath the [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]] was accidentally discovered by [[Sergio Gómez Chávez]] and Julie Gazzola, archaeologists of the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH). After days of heavy rainstorm Gómez Chávez noticed that a nearly three-foot-wide [[sinkhole]] occurred near the foot of the temple pyramid.&lt;ref name="INAH-2010-08-03"&gt;National Institute of Anthropology and History ([[INAH]]), Mexico.

First trying to examine the hole with a flashlight from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk he realized it was a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was aware that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the [[Pyramid of the Sun]], and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Associated Press]]. [https://phys.org/news/2010-12-experts-ancient-mexicans-crossbred-wolf-dogs.html Experts: Ancient Mexicans crossbred wolf-dogs], ''[[Phys.org]]'' (Science X network), December 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] GmbH. [https://phys.org/news/2011-05-tunnel-temple-mexico.html Tunnel found under temple in Mexico], ''[[Phys.org]]'' (Science X network), May 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary planning of the exploration and fundraising took more than six years.&lt;ref name="INAH-2010-08-03"/&gt;

Before the start of excavations, beginning in the early months of 2004, Dr. [[Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera]], from [[UNAM]] Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of [[ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a [[remote-controlled]] [[robot]] called [[Tlaloc II-TC]], equipped with an infrared camera and a [[laser scanner]] that generates [[3D scanner|3D visualization]] to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.&lt;ref name="INAH-2010-08-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtDaily-2010-11-12"&gt;[http://artdaily.com/news/42504/First-Images-of-the-Interior-of-Teotihuacan-Tunnel-Captured-by-Camera-on-Small-Robot First Images of the Interior of Teotihuacan Tunnel Captured by Camera on Small Robot], ''ArtDaily'', November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossella_Lorenzi"&gt;Rossella Lorenzi.

In 2009, the government granted Gómez permission to dig. By the end of 2009 archaeologists of the [[INAH]] located the entrance to the tunnel that leads to galleries under the pyramid, where rests of rulers of the ancient city might have been deposited. In August 2010 Gómez Chávez, now director of ''Tlalocan Project: Underground Road'', announced that INAH's investigation of the tunnel - closed nearly 1,800 years ago by Teotihuacan dwellers - will proceed. The INAH team, consisted of about 30 persons supported with national and international advisors at the highest scientific levels, intended to enter the tunnel in September–October 2010. This excavation, the deepest made at the Pre-Hispanic site, was part of the commemorations of the 100th anniversary of archaeological excavations at Teotihuacan and its opening to the public.&lt;ref name="INAH-2010-08-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;

It was mentioned that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, deliberately sealed with large boulders nearly 2,000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance; a vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel. At 14 meters deep, the entrance leads to a nearly 100-meter long corridor that ends in a series of underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel, a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced slowly and with painstaking care; excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock [[jade]] and [[quartz]], elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of [[Metallizing|metallized]] spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimetres, the balls have a core of [[clay]] and are covered with a yellow [[jarosite]] formed by the [[oxidation]] of [[pyrite]]. According to [[George Cowgill]] of [[Arizona State University]], the spheres are a fascinating find: ''"Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally, the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no idea what they mean."''&lt;ref name="Rossella_Lorenzi"/&gt; All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;

One of the most remarkable findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] representing lakes.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Yuhas. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/liquid-mercury-mexican-pyramid-teotihuacan Liquid mercury found under Mexican pyramid could lead to king's tomb], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of [[magnetite]], [[pyrite]] (fool's gold), and [[hematite]] to provide a glittering brightness to the complex, and to create the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld.&lt;ref name="Rossella_Lorenzi"/&gt; At the end of the passage, Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] statues, wearing garments and beads; their open eyes would have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and appearing to contemplate up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - likely the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;

After each new segment was cleared, the [[3D scanner]] documented the progress. By 2015 nearly 75,000 fragments of artifacts have been discovered, studied, cataloged, analyzed and, when possible, restored.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-2016-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtDaily-2010-11-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossella_Lorenzi"/&gt;

The significance of these new discoveries is publicly explored in a major exhibition at the [[De Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]], which opened in late September 2017.&lt;ref name="Laity-Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="De_Young2017"/&gt;

As of January 23, 2018 the name "Teotihuacan" has come under scrutiny by experts, who now feel that the site's name may have been changed by Spanish colonizers in the 16th century. Archaeologist Veronica Ortega of the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] states that the city appears to have actually been named "Teohuacan", meaning "City of the Sun" rather than "City of the Gods", as the current name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Teotihuacan ruins may have been 'Teohuacan'|url=http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/mexicos-teotihuacan-ruins-may-have-been-teohuacan|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=National Post|date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site layout===

The city's broad central [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]], called "Avenue of the Dead" (a translation from its Nahuatl name ''Miccoatli''), is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture, including the immense '''[[Pyramid of the Sun]]''' (third largest in the [[World]] after the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]). '''[[Pyramid of the Moon]]''' and '''The Ciudadela''' with '''[[Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Teotihuacan|Temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzalcoatl]]''' are placed at the both ends of Avenue while '''[[Quetzalpapálotl|Palace-museum Quetzalpapálot]]''', fourth basic structure of site, situated between two main pyramids. Along the Avenue are many smaller talud-tablero platforms also. The Aztecs believed they were tombs, inspiring the name of the avenue. Scholars have now established that these were ceremonial platforms that were topped with temples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Teotihucan layout.gif|thumb|A recreation of a map of the city featured in the June 1967 issue of Scientific American and the captioned source.]]

The Avenue of the dead is roughly forty meters wide and four Kilometers long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pueblosoriginarios.com/meso/valle/teotihuacan/muertos.html|title=Calzada de los Muertos. Zona arqueológica de Teotihuacan|website=pueblosoriginarios.com|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further down the Avenue of the Dead, after small river, is the area known as the Citadel, containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzalcoatl. This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city. The name "Citadel" was given to it by the Spanish, who believed it was a fort. Most of the common people lived in large apartment buildings spread across the city. Many of the buildings contained workshops where artisans produced pottery and other goods.

The urban layout of Teotihuacan exhibits two slightly different orientations, which resulted from astronomical criteria, rather than topographic. The central part of the city, including the Avenue of the Dead, conforms to the orientation of the Sun Pyramid, while the southern part reproduces the orientation of the Ciudadela. The two constructions recorded sunrises and sunsets on particular dates, allowing the use of an observational calendar. During the time of 100 A.D., “the sunrises on February 11 and October 29 and sunsets on April 30 and August 13. The interval from February 11 and October 29, as well as from August 13 to April 30, is exactly 260 days”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomical alignments at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=Latin American Antiquity |date=2000 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recorded dates are in multiples of 13 and 20 days, which align with the traditional Mesoamerican calendar. Furthermore, the Sun Pyramid is aligned to Cerro Gordo to the north, which means that it was purposefully built there to witness the sunrises on these specific dates along the horizon of the hills.  The artificial cave under the pyramid additionally attests to the importance of this spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomical alignments at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=Latin American Antiquity |date=2000 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=403-415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fact that both orientations belong to alignment groups that are widespread in Mesoamerica can only be explained with the use of astronomical references at the horizon. Teotihuacan belongs to the [[E-Group]], meaning that the alignment of their structures are in order to organize a calendar from the sunrises and sunsets of [[solstices]], proving that the placement of the structures did not rely heavily on topographic criteria, but rather on astronomical alignments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the rejection of the natural lay of the land is the placement of the San Juan River, as its placement was modified to bend around the structures as it goes through the centre of town eventually to return to its natural course outside of Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony |title=Skywatchers |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=United States of America |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the E-Group were all in the same general region of Mesoamerica, means their calendar was used for agricultural purposes. The E-Group’s significance of the four main dates of their calendric year was for the purpose of agriculture. These dates signified the cycle of maize farming: February was for preparations, May brought rain which meant it was time to plant the maize, August was when the maize would begin to grow, and November was the time to harvest. This 260-day calendar was made by the Aztecs and was called the [[tonalpohualli]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomical alignments at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=Latin American Antiquity |date=2000 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=403-415}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony |last2=Hartung |first2=Horst |last3=Buckingham |first3=Beth |title=The Pecked Cross Symbol in Ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Science 202 |date=1978 |volume=4365 |page=267}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malmstrom |first1=Vincent |title=Geographical Diffusion and Calendrics in Pre-Columbiam Mesoamerica |journal=Geographical Review 82 |date=1992 |volume=2 |page=113-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions served as a way to design the urban grid, and as a way to read their 260-day calendar. The urban grid had great significance to city planners when constructing Teotihuacan, as the cross is pecked into the ground in the Pyramid of the Sun in specific places throughout Teotihuacan in precise degrees and angles over three kilometres in distance. The layout of these crosses suggest it was there to work as a grid to the layout of Teotihuacan because they are laid out in a rectangular shape facing the Avenue of the Dead. These crosses point to the direction of rising and setting sun during the solstices, showing another way the seasons were observed. Some of the crosses marked the [[Tropic of Cancer]], which also places significance in the position of the sun. The direction of the axes of the crosses don’t point to an astronomical North and South direction, but instead point to their own city’s North. This was to ensure the people of Teotihuacan could see the skyline without any obstructions. Numerology also has significance in the cross pecking because of the placement and amount of the holes, which count to 260 days, which was the Aztec’s traditional calendar. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aveni, Hartung, Buckingham |first1=Anthony, Horst, Beth |title=The Pecked Cross Symbol in Ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Science 202 |date=1978 |volume=4365 |page=267-279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the pecked-cross circles also resemble an ancient Aztec game called, [[patolli]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony |title=Skywatchers |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=United States of America |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
These pecked-cross circles can be found not just in Teotihuacan, but also throughout Mesoamerica. The ones found all share certain similarities. These include, having the shape of two circles, one being inside of the other. They are all found pecked on the ground or onto rocks. They are all created with a small hammer-like device that produces cuplike markings that are 1 centimetre in diameter and 2 centimetres apart. They all have axes that are in line with the city structures of the region. Because they are aligned with the structures of the cities, they also align with the position of significant astronomical bodies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony |title=Skywatchers |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=United States of America |page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ciudadela was completed during the Miccaotli phase, and the Pyramid of the Sun underwent a complex series of additions and renovations. The Great Compound was constructed across the Avenue of the Dead, west of Ciudadela. This was probably the city’s marketplace. The existence of a large market in an urban center of this size is strong evidence of state organization. Teotihuacan was at that point simply too large and too complex to have been politically viable as a chiefdom.

The Ciudadela is a great enclosed compound capable of holding 100,000 people. About 700,000 cubic meters (yards) of material was used to construct its buildings. Its central feature is the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, which was flanked by upper class apartments. The entire compound was designed to overwhelm visitors.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Threat from development==
The archaeological park of Teotihuacan is under threat from development pressures. In 2004, the governor of [[Mexico state]], [[Arturo Montiel]], gave permission for [[Wal-Mart]] to build a large store in the third archaeological zone of the park. According to Sergio Gómez Chávez, an archaeologist and researcher for Mexico's [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH) fragments of ancient pottery were found where trucks dumped the soil from the site.&lt;ref&gt;David Barstow and Alejandra Xanix von Vertrab. December 17, 2012 [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/business/walmart-bribes-teotihuacan.html?pagewanted=all The Bribery Aisle: How Wal-Mart Got Its Way in Mexico], [[New York Times]] Wal-Mart Abroad&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Teotihuacan has become the center of controversy over Resplandor Teotihuacano, a massive light and sound spectacular installed to create a night time show for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Prensa Latina, [http://www.banderasnews.com/0902/nr-pyramidproject.htm ''Protesters Demand Stop on Pyramid Project''], Banderas News, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prensa Latina, [http://twocircles.net/2009feb18/tourists_reject_sound_and_light_show_mexican_pyramids.html ''Tourists reject sound and light show at Mexican pyramids''], TwoCircles.net, February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics explain that the large number of perforations for the project have caused fractures in stones and irreversible damage, while the project will have limited benefit.

'''USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education,''' formerly '''Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation,''' is a nonprofit organization dedicated to making audio-visual interviews with survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides a compelling voice for education and action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Us|url = http://sfi.usc.edu/about|publisher = USC Shoah Foundation|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 1994, one year after completing his [[66th Academy Awards|Academy Award-winning film]] ''[[Schindler's List]].'' The original aim of the Institute was to record testimonies of survivors and other witnesses of the [[Holocaust]] (which in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is called the ''[[Shoah]]'') as a collection of videotaped interviews.

In January 2006, the Foundation partnered with and relocated to the [[University of Southern California]] and was renamed the '''USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education.'''

The Foundation conducted nearly 52,000 video testimonies between 1994 and 1999, and currently has more than 55,000 testimonies. The bulk of the video testimonies expound on the Holocaust, including such experiences as Jewish Survivors, Rescuers and Aid-Providers, Sinti and Roma Survivors, Liberators, Political Prisoners, Jehovah's Witness Survivors, War Crimes Trial Participants, Eugenic Policies Survivors, Non-Jewish Forced Laborers and Homosexual Survivors,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but USC Shoah Foundation's [[Visual History Archive]] expanded in 2013 to include testimonies of Tutsi survivors of the [[Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda]] and has expanded in recent years to include interviews with survivors of other genocides, including the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Cambodian Genocide]], [[Guatemalan Genocide]], [[Nanjing Massacre]] in Nanjing, China, and the current violence against the [[Rohingya]] in Myanmar.

The vast majority of the testimonies contain a complete personal history of life before, during, and after the interviewee's firsthand experience with genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The testimonies are preserved in the Visual History Archive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the VHA|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/what_is_the_vha|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest digital collections of its kind in the world. The Visual History Archive is digitized, fully searchable via indexed keywords, and hyperlinked to the minute. With more than 112,000 hours of testimony stored in the Archive, indexing technology is essential for enabling users to pinpoint topics of interest. Indexing allows students, teachers, professors, researchers and others around the world to retrieve entire testimonies or search for specific sections within testimonies through a set of nearly 64,000 keywords and phrases, 1.8 million names, and 695,000 images. Each testimony is indexed by a native speaker and each minute of video is timecoded in English to a proprietary search engine using Institute-patented technology. They average a little over two hours each in length and were conducted in 63 countries and 41 languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Institute has access to other primary resources in addition to the audio-visual testimonies. A Holocaust and Genocide Studies collection recently acquired by USC's Doheny Library contains more than 1,000 original Nazi books and pamphlets, Jewish publications, microfilms with original documents such as Nazi newspapers and a nearly complete series of original transcripts of the International Nuremberg trials. Also included in the Doheny collection: early Holocaust historiography; early post-war publications of diaries and testimonies in various languages; and original papers of German and Austrian refugees from the Third Reich, including those of the famous German-Jewish writer Lion Feuchtwanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocaust Studies Collection at USC Doheny Memorial Library|url=http://dornsife.usc.edu/2020-resistance-holocaust-collection|publisher=USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Institute's Visual History Archive is expanding its collection to include testimony from survivors and witnesses of other genocides, including the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda,&lt;ref name="Rwanda Genocide"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Anne Marie|title=Every Genocide Leaves a Legacy|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/pressroom/releases/every-genocide-leaves-legacy|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nanjing Massacre, Armenian Genocide and Guatemalan Genocide. Sixty-four Rwandan testimonies were added in the spring of 2013, and 12 testimonies from survivors of the Nanjing Massacre&lt;ref name="Nanjing Massacre collection"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=Nanjing Massacre Collection Integrated Into Visual History Archive|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/02/nanjing-massacre-collection-integrated-visual-history-archive|accessdate=2014-02-28|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; were added in the spring of 2014, and 18 more were added in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/10/6742-eighteen-new-testimonies-recorded-nanjing-massacre-collection|title = Eighteen New Testimonies Recorded for Nanjing Massacre Collection|date = October 8, 2014|access-date = February 1, 2016|publisher = USC Shoah Foundation|last = Migdol|first = Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute currently has 332 testimonies from the Armenian Genocide in the VHA,&lt;ref name="Armenian Genocide Collection"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=Armenian Film Foundation Delivers 400 Digitized Testimonies to USC Shoah Foundation |url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/04/armenian-film-foundation-delivers-400-digitized-testimonies-usc-shoah-foundation|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were then integrated into the Visual History Archive by the event's April 24, 2015 centennial and to commemorate the 20th century's first genocide.

== Research ==
The Institute aspires to be the world's academic authority on the study of genocide and personal testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/research|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to incorporate new collections of genocide eyewitness testimonies while simultaneously fostering scholarly activities that confront real-world problems the testimonies address. Scholars in many fields have utilized the vast resources of the Visual History Archive to teach more than 400 university courses across four continents, including 112 courses at USC. Researchers and thought leaders have utilized the testimonies in more than 121 scholarly works and the archive has been central to dozens of conferences across a range of disciplines.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Center for Advanced Genocide Research is the research and scholarship unit of the Institute. Founded in 2014, the Center is dedicated to advancing new areas of interdisciplinary research on the Holocaust and genocide, specifically discussing the origins of genocide and how to intervene in the cycle that leads to mass violence..
The Center holds international conferences and workshops and hosts fellows and scholars in residence to conduct research using the vast resources available at the University of Southern California.
The Center will award up to 10 fellows every year.
Institute fellows, staff and student interns participate in more than a dozen academic events on the USC campus annually. It distinguishes itself by focusing on interdisciplinary study organized around three themes to advance the analysis of genocide and systematic mass violence on an international scale. Resistance to Genocide and Mass Violence focuses on acts of resistance and elements of defiance that slow down or stop genocidal processes. Violence, Emotion and Behavioral Change studies the nature of genocide and mass violence and how they impact emotional, social, psychological, historical and physical behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Institute, in conjunction with the Center for Advanced Genocide Research, held an international conference in November 2014 at USC titled "Memory, Media and Technology: Exploring the Trajectories of Schindler's List," examining the trajectories of memory, media and technology throughout a range of disciplines and from a variety of vantage points and venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/research/conferences/2014_international|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Center for Advanced Genocide Research in collaboration with the [[USC Thornton School of Music|Thornton School of Music]] and USC Visions and Voices hosted  the international conference titled "Singing in the Lion's Mouth: Music as Resistance to Violence"  which include two days of programming that highlight the use of music as a tool to resist oppression and spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://sfi.usc.edu/events/usc-shoah-foundation-center-advanced-genocide-research-singing-lions-mouth-music-resistance|title = USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research: "Singing in the Lion's Mouth: Music as Resistance to Genocide"|date = October 11, 2015|access-date = February 3, 2016|publisher = USC Shoah Foundation|last = Migdol|first = Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Genocide Studies ==
Digital Genocide Studies examines how big data and large datasets, including the 53,000 testimonies in the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive, can be used to find patterns in the field of mass violence and its resistance. The Institute also organizes a yearly series of academic events that brings scholars to USC to present lectures, film screenings and panel discussions. The Visual History Archive is fully viewable at 51 subscribing institutions in 13 countries around the world, mainly universities and museums. The Institute also offers a subscription for partial access to the Archive. About 211 institutions in 34 countries have contracted for these smaller collections.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

About 1,200 testimonies are also available to any member of the public with an Internet connection who registers to access the Visual History Archive Online. In addition to broadening its reach, the Institute dedicates considerable attention to maintaining each testimony's audio-visual quality, to protect it from degrading over time. With contributions from technology companies, the Institute devised a preservation system where the original videos were digitized into a variety of commonly used formats. The digitization of the entire Archive took five years to complete, from 2008 to 2012. During the digitization project, it was discovered that about 5 percent of the 235,005 tapes had audio or visual problems, some to the point of being unwatchable. Finding there were few existing options for restoring tape-based material, the Institute's ITS team created new software programs to help them recover both audio and visual problems. To ensure that the world's largest database of genocide testimony lives in perpetuity, the Institute has created a digital collections management technology used by clients to preserve their aging media. Among them are the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and Warner Bros. Pictures. Also under the Access umbrella is the Institute's collections unit, which works to expand the Visual History Archive by conducting additional interviews, integrating testimony taken by other institutions, and providing training on the Institute's preferred methodology for gathering testimony.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Education ==
Using testimony from the Visual History Archive, the Institute develops teaching tools for educators across the disciplinary spectrum, such as social studies, English Language Arts, government, foreign language, world history, American history, and character education. The Institute also provides professional development to prepare educators worldwide to use testimony in relevant and engaging ways—providing an experience that takes students beyond the textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/teach_and_learn|website=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IWitness, the Institute's flagship educational website for teachers and their students, provides students access to 1,600 testimonies for guided exploration. Students can engage with the testimonies and bring them into their own multimedia projects via a built-in video editor.  
Approximately 17,000 high school students and over 5,000 educators in 57 countries and all 50 U.S. states have used IWitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=Hundreds of Students and Teachers Piloting IWitness in Rwanda|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/06/hundreds-students-and-teachers-piloting-iwitness-rwanda|issue=June 16, 2014|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute has trained more than 39,000 educators around the world to incorporate testimony into classroom lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teacher Trainings on the Rise|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2013/07/teacher-trainings-rise|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More than 200 educators have participated in advanced training and the Teaching with Testimony in the 21st Century programs in the U.S., Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=USC Shoah Foundation To Participate in Czech-Polish Seminar on Teaching with Testimony|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/05/usc-shoah-foundation-participate-czech-polish-seminar-teaching-testimony|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's other education programs include:
* '''Teaching with Testimony in the 21st Century''' – A two-year professional development program to help educators build their capacity to use testimony and digital learning tools such as IWitness appropriately and effectively in their learning environments.
* '''ITeach''' – A one-day seminar that includes an introduction to USC Shoah Foundation's educational programs, the Visual History Archive, methodology, social psychology and pedagogical theory, and the introduction of a testimony-based lesson a teacher has already developed.
* '''IWalks''' – An interactive education program that connects the Visual History Archive and other primary sources, to physical locations with memories of historical events that took place on these locations in several European cities. IWalks have been created in Budapest, Hungary; Prague in the Czech Republic; and Warsaw, Poland.
* '''Teacher Innovation Network''' – A system created by the Institute to foster collaboration among teachers around the world who have intersected with the Institute's education programs. Membership is automatic based on educators' participation in the Institute's professional-development programs or their registration in IWitness. Monthly e-blasts keep members updated on the activities of the Institute, and invite dialogue among educators.
* '''Echoes and Reflections''' – A Holocaust- focused multimedia professional development program providing secondary teachers in the United States with accurate and authentic Holocaust information for their classrooms. Developed by the USC ShoahFoundation, Yad Vashem, and the Anti- Defamation League, Echoes and Reflections hold workshops around the country at no cost to teachers or schools. Participants receive a complimentary copy of the 10-part Teacher's Resource Guide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Global access ==
Testimony is reaching a broad international audience through the Institute's Visual History Archive, as well as IWitness, its YouTube channel, and its Web portals in 12 languages. The complete Visual History Archive is available at 49 institutions around the world, while smaller collections are available at 199 sites in 33 countries. The Institute will continue to develop digital technologies to preserve and enhance the Visual History Archive, while building access pathways for a broad audience of students, educators, scholars and the general public. 
Approximately 1.6 million students, researchers, teachers and laypersons view the testimonies every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=Freie University Berlin Offering Summer School Course on the Visual History Archive|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/07/5652-freie-university-berlin-offering-summer-school-course-visual-history-archive|issue=July 2, 2014|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Visual History Archive Online (vhaonline.usc.edu) features more than 1,200 testimonies accessible worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migdol|first1=Robin|title=Dartmouth College Is a Visual History Archive Full Access Site|url=http://sfi.usc.edu/news/2014/05/dartmouth-college-visual-history-archive-full-access-site|publisher=USC Shoah Foundation|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an eye toward expanding its audience, USC Shoah Foundation broadcasts its content across many platforms. In 2015, to underscore this priority, the Institute added Global Outreach as its fourth organizational pillar. The progress has been remarkable. In one year — between 2013–14 and 2014–15 — the number of people intersecting with the Institute's testimony nearly doubled, from 3.6 million to 6.5 million. The number increases to 15 million when including media exposure, TV broadcasts, museum exhibits, presentations at conferences and workshops, and social media. Global outreach is conducted through owned media such as websites and Institute supported documentaries and exhibits; earned media including prominent national and international press coverage about its programs; and shared media distributed across a wide range of social platforms.
* On a daily basis, the Institute posts stories and blogs about projects and people, as well as a new clip of testimony culled from the Visual History Archive.
* The Institute boasts a strong following on Facebook and Twitter, and recently launched an Instagram account.
* In 2014 the Institute initiated a successful social media campaign called #BeginsWithMe to engage with the millennial generation.
* USC Shoah Foundation and Comcast launched a five-year partnership in 2014 to annually bring programming to millions of customers over the course of seven weeks in the spring commemorating Genocide Awareness Month. Each year, the series is themed with a feature film anchoring the program offerings. The 2015 theme, Music, was anchored by The Pianist and introduced by actor Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for his role in the film. To expand its reach further and continue placing testimony at the forefront of its global engagement efforts, the Institute seeks to accelerate media production to generate new testimony-based content across multiple channels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In 2017 the Institute initiated a successful multi-channel campaign called #strongerthanhate in order to provide teachers, parents and community leaders educational tools to help "confront the seeds of hate" &lt;ref&gt;"Stronger Than Hate Home" https://sfi.usc.edu/sth&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Factor''' is a view of modern history that promotes the United States as the contingent reason for the Allied Powers winning both [[World War]]s and for preventing any powerful rival political regime from becoming mainstream in the 21st century world.

== Background ==

[[Azar Gat]], argues that this "United States Factor" is both widely overlooked and the reason for democracy's victory over totalitarianism in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gat2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=565–567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States Factor notion, "if it were not for the existence of the USA the liberal democracies would most probably have lost the great struggles of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt;

== United States Factor in History ==

The 20th century did appear to witness what many theorists have seen as the end of the battles of political ideology, with the political model of [[liberal democracy]] coming out on top. Indeed, [[political scientist]]s, including [[Francis Fukuyama]], hailed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] as the "end of history" in which the ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy [becomes] the final form of human government." (See [[End of History and the Last Man]])

In the view of the United States Factor, this "end of history" is made possible only because the USA was in a unique space economically, geographically, politically, and militarily throughout the 20th century that made it possible for the United States to "rescue" the [[Old World]] powers from the threat of [[totalitarianism]]. These menaces included both right wing totalitarian regimes, such as [[Nazism]], as well as left wing totalitarianism—better known as Soviet-era Communism. (See [[State ideology of the Soviet Union]])

Though Gat acknowledges that the victory of democracy over totalitarianism was not necessarily "preordained" at the outset of either World War, he goes on to remark that the sheer fact that the USA existed gave liberal democracies their "edge" in the battle against totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt; This was achieved mainly by the USA's contributions to the European Allies' war efforts from a distant location that was geographically large and politically united.&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt;

== American Exceptionalism ==

This is a view of modern history that fits within the political theory of [[American exceptionalism]]. American exceoptionalism, as defined by Jentleson, is a theory that holds that the United States possesses an inherent uniqueness and "special virtue" that is rooted in American principles and can be traced throughout American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jentleson|first=Bruce|title=American Foreign Policy: The Dynamics of Choice in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-393-93357-4|pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the United States is exceptional, or extraordinary, simply because it is the United States is a political philosophy that has been in existence for several decades and is a leading contributor to contemporary American political culture. (See [[Politics of the United States]])

== Competing Views ==

There are many other ideas as to the behaviors of states and how they react and interact in the world. Such views that provide alternate theories to American exceptionalism and the United States Factor include [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], and [[idealism]], just to name a few. These are some of the popular theories used in today's discussions about International Relations. They put emphasis on states' behaviors and how to forecast potential outcomes of the entire spectrum of international affairs, from militarized conflict to diplomacy.

{{Contains Indic text}}
[[File:Vaimanika Shastra title page.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Title page of the English translation of ''Vyamanika Shastra'' published in 1973]]
The '''''Vaimānika Śāstra''''' ({{lang|sa|वैमानिक शास्त्र}}, lit. "[[shastra]] on the topic of [[Vimana]]s"; or "science of aeronautics", sometimes also rendered ''Vimanika, Vymanika, Vyamanika'') is an early 20th-century [[Sanskrit]] text on [[aerospace]] [[technology]].  It makes the claim that the ''[[Vimana|vimāna]]s'' mentioned in ancient [[Sanskrit epics]] were advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles.

The existence of the text was revealed in 1952 by G. R. Josyer who asserted that it was written by Pandit Subbaraya Shastry (1866&amp;ndash;1940), who dictated it during the years 1918&amp;ndash;1923. A Hindi translation was published in 1959, while the Sanskrit text with an English translation was published in 1973. It contains 3000 [[shloka]]s in 8 chapters which Shastry claimed was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu [[Maharishi|sage]] [[Bharadvaja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Childress|1991|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The text has gained favour among proponents of [[ancient astronaut theories]].

A study by aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]], in 1974 concluded that the aircraft described in the text were "poor concoctions" and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Regarding the "Rukma Vimana", the study noted, "If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say, it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility".&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974 page=12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mukunda|1974|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and publication==
Subbaraya Shastry was a mystic from [[Anekal]], who was reputed to speak out verses (''[[sloka meter|slokas]]'') whenever he got inspiration, described by Josyer as "a walking lexicon gifted with occult perception". According to Josyer, he dictated the text to  G. Venkatachala  Sharma in the early 1900s (completing it in 1923).  According to the history unearthed by Mukunda et al.,&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974"/&gt; Shastry was born in a small village in [[Hosur]] Taluk.  His parents died at a young age and he was diseased and in a poor state.  While wandering, he met a great saint at [[Kolar]], who initiated him into spirituality and revealed to him several shastras, including the Vimana Shastra. Afterwards, Shastri settled into normal life.  Shastri had no formal schooling and learnt to read and write only after returning from his encounter with the saint. It is unlikely the text was his own invention.{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}

Subbaraya Shastry died in 1941, and Venkatachala took his manuscripts into keeping. The ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' manuscript appeared at Rajakiya Sanskrit Library, [[Baroda]] by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mukunda|1974}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text was published in [[Hindi]] in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parivrajaka|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in English by G.R. Josyer, titled ''Vymanika Shastra''.&lt;ref name="Shastry 1973"/&gt; Josyer's edition also added illustrations drawn by T. K. Ellappa, a draughtsman at a local engineering college in [[Bengaluru, India|Bangalore]], under the direction of Shastry, which had been missed in the 1959 edition.&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mukunda|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence was first announced publicly in a 1952 press release by G.R. Josyer, who had founded his "International Academy of Sanskrit Research" in [[Mysore]] the year before. In the foreword to the 1973 publication that contained the full Sanskrit text with English translation, Josyer quotes a 1952 press release of his which was "published in all the leading dailies of India, and was taken up by Reuter and other World Press News Services":&lt;ref name="Shastry 1973"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shastry|Josyer|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. G. R. Josyer, Director of the International Academy of Sanskrit Research in Mysore, in the course of an interview recently, showed some very ancient manuscripts which the Academy had collected. He claimed that the manuscripts were several thousands of years old, compiled by ancient rishis, Bharadwaja, Narada and others, dealing, not with the mysticism of ancient Hindu philosophy of Atman or Brahman, but with more mundane things vital for the existence of man and progress of nations both in times of peace and war.
[...] One manuscript dealt with Aeronautics, construction of various types of aircraft for civil aviation and for warfare. [...] Mr. Josyer showed some types of designs and drawing of a helicopter-type cargo-loading plane, specially meant for carrying combustibles and ammunition, passenger aircraft carrying 400 to 500 persons, double and treble-decked aircraft. Each of these types had been fully described.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Josyer then tells how he was visited by "Miss Jean Lyon, journalist of Toronto and New York" for an interview, and how Lyon in her ''Just Half a World Away'' (1954) concluded that he was "guilty of a rabid nationalism, seeking to wipe out everything since the [[Veda]]s".

A critical review pronounced Josyer's introduction to be "least scholarly by any standards" and said that "the people connected with publication – directly or indirectly – are solely to blame either for distorting or hiding the history of the manuscripts", perhaps in an attempt to "eulogise and glorify whatever they can find about our past, even without valid evidence". By tracing the provenance of the manuscript, interviewing associates of Shastry (including G. V. Sharma to whom the text was originally dictated), and based on the linguistic analysis of the text, the review concluded that it came into existence sometime between 1900 and 1922.&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974"/&gt;

Unlike modern treatises on aeronautics that begin by discussing the general principles of flight before detailing concepts of aircraft design, the ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' starts with a quantitative description, as though a particular aircraft is being described. The topics covered include, "definition of an airplane, a pilot, aerial routes, food, clothing, metals, metal production, mirrors and their uses in wars, varieties of machinery and yantras, planes like ‘mantrik’, ‘tantrik’, and ‘kritak’" and four planes called ''Shakuna'', ''Sundara'', ''Rukma'', and ''Tripura'' are described in greater detail. The extant text is claimed to be only a small (one-fortieth) part of a larger work ''Yantra Sarvaswa'' ("All about machines"&lt;ref name="Shastry 1973"/&gt;) composed by Maharishi Bharadwaj and other sages for the "benefit of all mankind".&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974"/&gt;

==Appraisal==
J. B. Hare of the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] in 2005 compiled an online edition of Josyer's 1973 book, in the site's "UFOs" section. In his introduction, Hare writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' was first committed to writing between 1918 and 1923, and nobody is claiming that it came from some mysterious antique manuscript. The fact is, there are no manuscripts of this text before 1918, and ''nobody is claiming that there are''. So on one level, this is not a [[hoax]]. You just have to buy into the assumption that 'channeling' works.
...
there is no exposition of the theory of aviation (let alone antigravity). In plain terms, the VS. never directly explains how Vimanas get up in the air. The text is top-heavy with long lists of often bizarre ingredients used to construct various subsystems. 
...
There is nothing here which [[Jules Verne]] couldn't have dreamed up, no mention of exotic elements or advanced construction techniques. The 1923 technical illustration based on the text ... are absurdly un-aerodynamic. They look like brutalist wedding cakes, with [[minaret]]s, huge [[ornithopter]] wings and dinky propellers. In other words, they look like typical early 20th century fantasy flying machines with an Indian twist.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1974 study by researchers at the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]], found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' described were aeronautically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating [[Newton's laws of motion]]. The study concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mukunda|1974|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any reader by now would have concluded the obvious – that the planes described above are the best poor concoctions, rather than expressions of something real. None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist flying. The text and the drawings do not correlate with each other even thematically. The drawings definitely point to a knowledge of modern machinery. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that Shri Ellappa who made the drawings was in a local [[engineering college]] and was thus familiar with names and details of some machinery. Of course the text retains a structure in language and content from which its 'recent nature' cannot be asserted. We must hasten to point out that this does not imply an oriental nature of the text at all. All that may be said is that thematically the drawings ought to be ruled out of discussion. And the text, as it stands, is incomplete and ambiguous by itself and incorrect at many places.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors expressed puzzlement at the contradiction and errors in the ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' text, especially since its compilers supposedly had access to publications that did not make such errors (such as [[Dayanand Saraswati]]'s commentary on the [[Rigveda]] published in 1878 or earlier).&lt;ref name="Mukunda 1974 page=12"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{main|2015 Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy}}
The 102nd [[Indian Science Congress]] held at the [[Mumbai University]] in January 2015 organised a session on "ancient sciences through [[Sanskrit]]" in which a presentation on ''Vaimānika Śāstra'' was included. It was delivered by Anand J. Bodas, a pilot, and Ameya Jadhav, who holds in an M.A. in [[Sanskrit]] as well as an M.Tech. degree. Bodas, speaking to the news media, has said that the aeroplanes of Vedic times could fly not only from country to country, but also "from planet to planet." "In those days, aeroplanes were huge in size, and could move left, right, as well as backwards, unlike modern planes which only fly forward," he added. Ram Prasad Gandhiraman, a NASA scientist, launched an on-line petition demanding that the talk be cancelled as it represents pseudo-science.&lt;ref name=pseudoscience&gt;[http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Pseudo-science-must-not-figure-in-Indian-Science-Congress/articleshow/45698353.cms Pseudo-science must not figure in Indian Science Congress, Mumbai Mirror, 31 December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/india/indian-science-congress-vedic-myth-must-not-be-masqueraded-as-science-says-nasa-scientist-2024755.html Indian Science Congress: Vedic myth must not be masqueraded as science, says Nasa scientist, Firstpost, 31 December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abbot Walter Bower''' (or '''Bowmaker'''; {{circa|1385}}{{snd}}24 December 1449) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[canon regular]] of [[Inchcolm Abbey]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], who is noted as a [[chronicler]] of his era. He was born about 1385 at [[Haddington, East Lothian]], in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="shr97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=D E R|date=April 1997|title=A National Treasure?

==Life==
Bower was trained at the [[University of St Andrews]] and became the [[abbot]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian community]] on Inchcolm in 1417.&lt;ref name="shr97"/&gt; He also acted as one of the commissioners for the collection of the [[ransom]] of King [[James I of Scotland]] in 1423 and 1424. Later, in 1433, he took part in a diplomatic mission to [[Paris]] to discuss the possibility of marriage of the king's daughter to the [[Dauphin of France]]. He played an important part at the Council of Perth of 1432 in the defence of Scottish rights.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bower, Walter|volume=4|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Bower's closing years he was engaged on his work, the ''[[Scotichronicon]]'', on which his reputation now chiefly rests. This work, undertaken in 1440 by desire of a neighbour, Sir David Stewart of [[Rosyth Castle]], was a continuation of the ''[[Chronica Gentis Scotorum]]'' of [[John of Fordun]]. The completed work, in its original form, consisted of sixteen books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun's—or mainly his, for Bower added to them at places. In the later books, down to the reign of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] (1371), he was aided by Fordun's ''[[Gesta Annalia]]'', but from that point to the close the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for James I, with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the two remaining years of Bower's life he was engaged on a reduction or "abridgment" of this work, which is known as the ''Book of Cupar'', and is preserved in the [[Advocates' library]], [[Edinburgh]] (MS. 35. 1. 7). Other abridgments, not by Bower, were made about the same time, one about 1450 (perhaps by [[Patrick Russell (monk)|Patrick Russell]], a [[Carthusian]] [[monk]] of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]), also preserved in the Advocates' library (MS. 35. 6. 7) and another in 1461 by an unknown writer, preserved in the same collection (MS. 35. 5. 2). Copies of the full text of the ''Scotichronicon'', by different scribes, still exist. There are two in the [[British Library]], in ''[[The Black Book of Paisley]]'', and in [[Harleian Library|Harl. MS.]] 712; one in the Advocates' library, from which [[Walter Goodall]] printed his edition (Edin., 1759), and one in the library of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

See also [[William Forbes Skene|W. F. Skene]]'s edition of Fordun in the series of ''Historians of Scotland'' (1871). Personal references are to be found in the ''Exchequer Rolls of Scotland'', iii. and iv.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A revised and updated translation of Bower's work was produced under the leadership of Professor [[D. E. R. Watt]], in nine volumes, published between 1987 and 1997. The critical edition of Bower's Latin text in Watt et al. has been amended and corrected by Chris Nighman in light of the discovery that Bower made extensive use of Thomas of Ireland's collection of authoritative quotations, the ''[[Manipulus florum]]'' (1306).
