      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1123">The '''AGO system''' is the industrial process for manufacturing stitchless ([[Adhesive|glued]]) shoes. 

The first effective and reliable [[adhesive]] was invented and patented in 1909 by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[chemist]] [[Francesco Rampichini]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampichini.it/F-Rampichini.pdf Un pioniere della moderna industria conciaria e calzaturiera: Francesco Rampichini (1878-1958)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206200306/http://www.rampichini.it/F-Rampichini.pdf |date=December 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also developed the whole manufacturing process and the relevant machinery in 1910&amp;ndash;13.

The name AGO (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ago'', meaning "attract", "fasten"), still used in the industry, was chosen by Rampichini for the glue and the process in 1910.

'''Abdul Aziz bin Fahd''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالعزيز بن فهد بن عبد العزيز آل سعود}}) is a [[Saudi Arabian people|Saudi Arabian]] Prince and member of the Royal [[House of Saud]].

==Early life and education==
His mother is [[Al Jawhara bint Ibrahim Al Ibrahim]], belonging to the wealthy Al Ibrahim family.&lt;ref name=ajcenter&gt;{{cite web|title=HH Princess Al-Jawhara bint Ibrahim|url=http://al-jawhara-center.kau.edu.sa/Content.aspx?Site_ID=287&amp;lng=EN&amp;cid=40127|publisher=King Abdulaziz University|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Aziz bin Fahd received a bachelor of arts degree in administrative sciences from [[King Saud University]].&lt;ref name=webpage&gt;{{cite web|title=Index |url=http://www.abdulazizbinfahad.com/en_index.html |publisher=Web page dedicated to Abdul Aziz bin Fahd |accessdate=23 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502233511/http://www.abdulazizbinfahad.com/en_index.html |archivedate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional experience==
Prince Abdul Aziz was first appointed as minister of state without portfolio in May 1998.&lt;ref name=sonline&gt;{{cite web|title=The Council of Ministers|url=http://www.saudia-online.com/Government%20Council%20of%20Ministers.htm|publisher=Saudia Online|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he was made head of the Office of the Council of Ministers in January 2000, when he was 28 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakr|first=Naomi|authorlink=Naomi Sakr|title=Whys and Wherefores of Satellite Channel Ownership|journal=Satellite Realms: Transnational Television, Globalization and the Middle East|year=2001|url=http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=13&amp;reading_id=1029&amp;sequence=3|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that after [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]'s death, he began to live in [[Switzerland]] and came to [[Saudi Arabia]] to participate in the meetings of the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prens Abdülaziz bin Fahd'ın çöküşü (The Fall of Abdulaziz bin Fahd) |url=http://www.diplomatikgozlem.com/TR/belge/1-7316/prens-abdulaziz-bin-fahdin-cokusu.html |publisher=Diplomatik Gözlem (Turkish, Diplomatic Observation) |accessdate=12 April 2012 |date=14 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615022826/http://www.diplomatikgozlem.com/TR/belge/1-7316/prens-abdulaziz-bin-fahdin-cokusu.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2011, he was relieved from his position as head of the court of Cabinet affairs by a royal decree.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Abdul Ghafour (26 June 2011):[http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article462235.ece "Cabinet court merged with royal court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630104155/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article462235.ece |date=30 June 2011 }}. Arab News.&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared that he resigned from his posts of minister of State and member of the Council of Ministers at his own request in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fahd bin Abdul Aziz’s exemption from the Presidency of the Prime Ministry Cabinet Office|url=http://www.islamtimes.org/vdcg3y97.ak9t74j5ra.html|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=Islam Times|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
His ties with [[Saudi Oger]] were well known in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The company was founded by [[Rafik Hariri]], who built Saudi Oger into a large company with the assistance of [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. Hariri said ‘The meat on my shoulder is from King Fahd,’ according to [[As'ad Abu Khalil]], a professor of political science at [[California State University Stanislaus]], who has written several books and runs the blog [[The Angry Arab News Service]]. Hariri, also a former prime minister of [[Lebanon]], was assassinated in 2005. His son, [[Saad Hariri]], took over Saudi Oger and became Lebanon’s prime minister for 14 months before he was ousted in 2011. Saad Hariri and Prince Abdul Aziz are known to be close.&lt;ref name=russ&gt;{{cite news|last=Buettner|first=Russ|title=At a Rape Trial, Two Views of a Prince’s Wealth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/nyregion/at-rape-trial-2-views-of-a-saudi-princes-wealth.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Aziz bin Fahd  owned fifty percent of the [[MBC Group|MBC]], of which the remainder is owned by his maternal uncle [[Waleed bin Ibrahim al Ibrahim]]. It is reported that Prince Abdul Aziz dealt with both the profits and the ideology of MBC Channels, including [[al Arabiya]].&lt;ref name=wikileaks09&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideological and Ownership Trends in the Saudi Media|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|publisher=Cablegate|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=11 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116083750/http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|archive-date=16 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged in a [[New York Supreme Court]] affidavit that he was the secret owner of a $1 billion property portfolio in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Foley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-saudi-royals-secret-1bn-us-empire-7817936.html|title=Revealed: Saudi royals' secret $1bn US empire|publisher=The Independent|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which owns the American headquarters of the oil giant [[BP]] and the defence contractor [[BAe Systems]]. In January 2002 The Daily Telegraph newspaper valued the portfolio at £4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8272597/Former-Credit-Suisse-executive-Pierre-Rolin-owes-43m.html |title=Former Credit Suisse executive Pierre Rolin 'owes £43m'|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affidavit, which was subsequently partially sealed by the judge but had already become available on internet blogs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96621795/Secret-1B-Saudi-Property-Empire|title=Secret $1B Saudi Property Empire|publisher=Scribd|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sethhettena.com/2012/documents-reveal-secret-1b-saudi-property-empire/ |title=Docs Reveal Secret $1B Saudi Property Empire"Seth Hettena |publisher=Seth Hettena |date=10 June 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815081659/http://www.sethhettena.com/2012/documents-reveal-secret-1b-saudi-property-empire/ |archivedate=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the properties were being managed by a group which included Sheikh Majid Al Ibrahim, Prince’s maternal uncle, and that total control of the portfolio was ultimately seized by Interventure Capital Group and Interventure Advisers, both of [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. According to a press release issued by Hyatt Hotels Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.hyatt.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=228969&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1656251&amp;highlight=|title=Hyatt Hotels Corporation|publisher=Investors|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventure Capital Group is run by Jaber Al Ibrahim and is an adviser to Naseel Holding Company, the Al Ibrahim family investment vehicle chaired by Sheikh Majid Al Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naseel.com/message.asp|title=Chairman Message|publisher=Naseel|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in October 2010, Interventure Capital Group is also behind another major portfolio of properties which had been controlled by a UK-based company, StratREAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8057153/Tory-donor-Pierre-Rolin-accused-of-stealing-30m-from-Gulf-investor.html|title=Tory donor Pierre Rolin accused of stealing £30m from Gulf investor |publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assets purchased by StratREAL on behalf of Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd included Fifth Street Towers, a Minneapolis office complex, for $294 million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StratREAL|url=http://www.bensoncairns.com/stratreal/images/5_news/pr2007/Minnesota.pdf|publisher=Srtrategic Real Estate Advisors|accessdate=24 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122035626/http://www.bensoncairns.com/stratreal/images/5_news/pr2007/Minnesota.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, following a foreclosure on the complex for mortgage default, Fifth Street Towers was sold at a sheriff's auction for $1 over the outstanding debt of $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Webber|first=Maura |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577390702752284054|title=Venture Pays $1 Over Debt To Win Minneapolis Tower|work=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mansion at 5 Palace Green, on London's [[Kensington Palace Gardens]] (nicknamed "Billionaires' Row"), was reported to be being offered for sale by Abdul Aziz in July 2013 for £100 million.&lt;ref name='Hipwell 2013'&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/property/article3827926.ece Billionaire Saudi’s £100m London home up for sale], ''[[The Times]]'', 29 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliances==
Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was previously one of [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]]'s closest aides. However, later, he seemed to have had a falling out with the monarch and to have been close to his uncle, the late [[Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Crown Prince Nayef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapoor|first=Talal|title=Nayif's Return – A Lame Duck Crown Prince?|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=79251&amp;pageNum=2|publisher=Datarabia|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fortune==
Abdul Aziz received exactly half of all profits of the successful Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC).&lt;ref name=wikileaks09/&gt; He had a number of palaces in Saudi Arabia and around various other parts of the world which have cost over $2 billion&lt;ref&gt;[http://syrianthinkers.org/countries/saudi/articles/TheSaudiTrap.pdf The Saudi Trap]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728080139/http://syrianthinkers.org/countries/saudi/articles/TheSaudiTrap.pdf |date=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

* London Mansion on the Billionaire's row in [[Kensington]], now for sale at £100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/prince-abdul-aziz-bin-fahd-al-saud-mansion/|title=Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd Al Saud Mansion |publisher=Virtual Globetrotting|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* A very large private stately residential complex with the replica of [[Alhambra]] and several other famous forts set within well maintained splendid gardens covering an area of 134 acres in the exclusive area overlooking Wadi Hanifa in Riyadh. {{Coord|24.645808|N|46.643202|E}}

* In [[Jeddah]] he has several palaces with private yacht berths and each palace has more than twenty guest houses .{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In addition, he reportedly owned "the Pyramid House" on Hillcrest Road in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavatore|first=Alison|title=Saudi Prince Reportedly Overhauling Beverly Hills Pyramid House|url=http://www.hauteliving.com/2013/02/saudi-prince-reportedly-overhauling-beverly-hills-pyramid-house/339276/|publisher=Houte Living|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/a-abdul-aziz-bin-fahda-pyramid-house/ |title=Abdul Aziz bin Fahd pyramid house |publisher=Virtual Globetrotting |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807103557/http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/a-abdul-aziz-bin-fahda-pyramid-house/ |archivedate=7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
The fate of Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd is uncertain.

The '''Bank of America Building''', also known as '''10 Light Street''' and formerly as the '''Baltimore Trust Company Building''', is a 34 story, {{convert|155.15|m|abbr=on}} [[skyscraper]] located at the corner of [[Baltimore Street-Fayette Street|East Baltimore]] and [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|Light Street]]s in [[downtown Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

==Description==
10 Light Street was the tallest building in the state, and the tallest office building in the United States south of New York City when constructed in 1929.  The [[Art Deco]] building was designed by the firm of Taylor and Fisher, and completed in eighteen months, fashioned from Indiana sandstone and local brick over a steel frame&lt;ref name=mhs&gt;Kelly, Denwood N., Shank Jr., Armand M., and Gordon, Thomas S. (1996). ''Money &amp; Banking in Maryland''. p. 48. [[Maryland Historical Society]], Baltimore. {{ISBN|0-938420-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of (U.S.) $3 million.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Olson, Sherry H. (1997). ''Baltimore: The Building of an American City''. pp. 314-15. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland. {{ISBN|0-8018-5640-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's exterior is decorated with carved Romanesque human and animal images, stylized eagles, and is capped with a copper and gold roof. The ornate, two-story main banking lobby is highly decorated with [[mosaic]] floors designed by [[Hildreth Meiere]], and historic [[mural]]s by Griffith Baily Coale and McGill Mackall on historic themes:  the [[Great Baltimore Fire|Baltimore fire of 1904]], and the writing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] at the [[Battle of Baltimore]] during the [[War of 1812]]. These murals are planned to be covered by artificial turf, so that the historic lobby can be used as an [[Under Armour]] gym.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/11/11/rare-artwork-underfoot-could-soon-be-out-of-sight/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Shortly after the Baltimore Trust Company moved into the building in 1929, the [[Great Depression]] began and the company foundered. The building was essentially vacant within a year, as the bank went into bankruptcy in 1933 and receivership in 1935.&lt;ref name=mhs /&gt; The empty building was subsequently used by the [[New Deal]]'s [[Public Works Administration]] in Maryland.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

From the 1940s into the 1960s, the building was first known as the Mathieson Building and then the O'Sullivan Building, reflecting its then-current major tenants.

During those years, Semmes, Bowen and Semmes, a major Maryland law firm with origins in the 19th century, occupied the twenty-first floor, and later as many as four whole floors (when the firm employed almost 150 attorneys), remaining in 10 Light Street until approximately 1990, at what was called the "Baltimore Trust Building," according to the 1952 memoir of [[Whittaker Chambers]], whose Semmes attorneys were [[Richard F. Cleveland]] (youngest son of President [[Grover Cleveland]]) and William D. Macmillan.&lt;ref name=witness&gt;

| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b1F3AAAAMAAJ
| date = 1952
| accessdate = 25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the building was purchased by [[MBNA|Maryland National Bank]], successor of Baltimore Trust, and the building name was changed to "Maryland National Bank Building." Maryland National was itself purchased by [[NationsBank]] in 1993, and the name of the building was changed again, to "NationsBank Building." The structure then obtained its current name following the NationsBank merger with [[Bank of America|BankAmerica]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=mhs /&gt; Major portions of the building were restored, including the copper-clad dome, which is once again floodlit at night.

In December 2012 the building was acquired by a Virginia firm which plans to convert the upper floors into residential apartments.&lt;ref name="Residential"&gt;{{cite news | title=10 Light Goes Residential | work=The Daily Record | date=December 4, 2012 | page=1 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank of America announced that it would close the ground floor banking center in May 2013. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, a prominent Baltimore law firm, had maintained offices in the building since 1932 when one of the firm's founders, [[Clarence Miles]], moved into the building.&lt;ref name="Residential"/&gt;

A bill of sale is a document that transfers ownership of goods from one person to another. It is used in situations where the former owner transfers possession of the goods to a new owner. Bills of sale may be used in a wide variety of transactions: people can sell their goods, exchange them, give them as gifts or mortgage them to get a loan. They can only be used:
* to transfer ownership of goods that people already own;
* to transfer ownership of moveable tangible goods; and
* by individuals and unincorporated businesses.
Bills of sale exist at [[common law]] quite independently of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces of legislation: the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. This area of the law was subject to review by the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]], which published a proposal for change in 2017.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123&gt;{{cite report |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662596/PRINT_-_From_Bills_of_Sale_to_Goods_Mortgages.pdf |title=From Bills of Sale to Goods Mortgages |isbn=978-1-5286-0110-8 |publisher=House of Commons |work=Law Commission |id=HC 495/Law Com No 376 |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bills of sale in the US ==

===Historical origin===
The term “bill of sale” originally referred to any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions is that the owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as a security for a grant, albeit without notice of the first mortgagee. This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud.

The evolution of various bills of sale laws, within the USA, was to curb the use of the bill of sale as a means of defrauding innocent persons. The first of such being the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]] which was repealed and re-enacted by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] which was almost on all fours with the 1854 act. Further developments led to the enactment of the [[Bills of Sale Act 1882]].

A bill of sale has been defined as a legal document made by the seller to a purchaser, reporting that on a specific date at a specific locality and for a particular sum of money or other value received, the seller sold to the purchaser a specific item of personal property, or parcel of real property of which he had lawful possession . The Black’s Law Dictionary  on its part defines a bill of sale as “an instrument for the conveyance of title to personal property, absolutely or by way of security”. According to Omotola the bill of sale is “a form of legal mortgage of chattels”. Bullen and Leake and Jacobs define a bill of sale as “a document transferring a proprietary interest in personal chattels from one individual (the “grantor”) to another (the “grantee”), without possession being delivered to the grantee”.

In essence, a bill of sale is a written instrument showing the voluntary transfer of a right or interest or title to personal property, either by way of security or absolutely, from one person to another without the actual physical possession of the property leaving the owner and being delivered to the other party. It is clear from the definitions above that the bills of sale are essentially of two types: The absolute bill of sale and the conditional bill of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.documatica-forms.com/usa/bill-of-sale/more-info.php |title=What is a USA Bill of Sale or Documented Sales Receipt? |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The absolute bill of sale===
Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere [[contract of sale|contracts of sale]] of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law.

===The conditional bill of sale===
The conditional bill of sale refers to any assignment or transfer of personal chattels to a person by way of security for the payment of money.  The conditional bill of sale creates a security in favour of the grantee of the bill whereby the grantee is given personal right of seizure giving right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

There are other forms of security over goods such as a pledge and contractual lien which also only give right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

An example of a conditional bill of sale can be found where a creditor gives a loan and has transferred to himself, as collateral or security for the loan, the title of the goods or other personal property of the debtor. The physical goods or other property however remains with the debtor.

=== Historical perspective ===
Bills of sale have existed at common law since at least the [[Middle Ages]], when they were most commonly used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the [[Victorian era]], bills of sale came to be used as a form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of:&lt;blockquote&gt;''all and every the household goods, furniture, plate, linen, china, books, stock in trade, brewing utensils and all the effects.''&lt;ref&gt;J Weir, "The Law of Bills of Sale" (1896) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most often, people would grant bills of sale over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. Bills of sale used in this way are known as “security bills”.

Sometimes, bills of sale would transfer ownership outright, such as when a person sold their goods to another while retaining possession. Bills of sale used for purposes other than borrowing money are known as “absolute bills”.

=== Bills of Sale Acts ===
The increased use of bills of sale in the Victorian era created a “false wealth” problem. Potential purchasers and other lenders could be misled into thinking that the person in possession of goods still owned them. The person in possession could sell the goods or use them to secure another loan. In both cases, the transaction was fraudulent, but the purchaser or lender had no way of discovering that the goods were already subject to a bill of sale.

As a result, Parliament passed the Bills of Sale Act 1878. This largely replicated the provisions of an earlier Bills of Sale Act 1854. It requires all bills of sale to be registered at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

The Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 had a different purpose. The 1878 Act led to a rise in the use of security bills. Concerns were expressed that such transactions could lead “thousands of honest and respectable people to their ruin”.&lt;ref name=hansard-1882&gt;Hansard (HC), 20 March 1882, vol 267, cc1398-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament noted that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many money-lenders advertised under the names of fictitious banks; and sometimes they advertised in this form – “A widow, with capital to spare, will be happy to lend on easy terms. Strict secrecy. Five per cent.”… Having entrapped a man into his office, the money-lender proceeded in this way – He produced a bill of sale containing a large number of clauses, which it was impossible for the borrower to read or understand in the time allowed...&lt;ref name=hansard-1882/&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In response, Parliament enacted the 1882 Act, which was an early attempt at consumer protection.

Both the 1878 Act and the 1882 Act remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by the 1882 Act and the 1878 Act, to the extent that its provisions are consistent with those of the 1882 Act.

=== Bills of sale in the 21st century ===
In the twenty-first century, bills of sale are overwhelmingly used in the form of so-called “[[Logbook loan|logbook loans]]”.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/09/cp225_bills_of_sale.pdf |title=Bills of Sale - A Consultation Paper |id=Consultation Paper No 225 |publisher=Law Commission |year=2015 |isbn=9780108561702 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} These are security bills secured on the borrower’s vehicle. Borrowers transfer ownership of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for the loan. While making repayments, borrowers keep possession of their vehicle and continue to use it. Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C registration document – or “logbook” – but this is purely symbolic and has no legal effect.

=== Criticism and reform of the law ===
The law of bills of sale has been criticised on a number of occasions. The Crowther report in 1971&lt;ref&gt;Report of the committee on consumer credit (1971) Cmnd 4596.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Diamond report in 1986&lt;ref&gt;A Diamond, ''A review of security interests in property'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; both considered the Acts, with the latter recommending repeal. 

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission made a number of criticisms of the law as it stood in 2015. It proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgages Act.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission identified five key problems with the Bills of Sale Acts:
* undue complexity;
* highly technical documentation;
* the registration regime is in need of modernisation;
* they offer little protection to borrowers;
* they offer no protection to third party purchasers.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|7}}
The Law Commission proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgage Act that would address each of the criticisms identified in the consultation paper.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

'''Business''' is the activity of making one's living or making [[money]] by producing or buying and selling [[Product (business)|products]] (such as [[goods and services]]).&lt;ref&gt; Compare: [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=business American Heritage Dictionary] "business [:] 1. The activity of buying and selling [[commodity | commodities]], products, or services".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longman Business English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/business Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English] "business [:] 1 [...] the activity of making money by producing or buying and selling goods, or providing services".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/business Oxford Living Dictionaries] "business [:] 2 The practice of making one's living by engaging in [[commerce]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton's Legal Thesaurus'', 4E. S.v. "business." Retrieved April 1, 2018 from https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/business&lt;/ref&gt; 

Having a [[business name]] does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.  If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.  A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.

The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a [[company]]. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for [[limited liability]], as well as [[corporate tax]] rates.  A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.

== Forms ==
{{Main|List of business entities}}

Forms of business ownership vary by [[jurisdiction]], but several common entities exist:

* '''Sole proprietorship:''' A [[sole proprietorship]], also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire [[employees]]. A sole proprietor has unlimited [[legal liability|liability]] for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from [[operating cost]]s or [[judgment]]s against the business. All [[asset]]s of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any [[inventory]], [[manufacturing]] equipment, or [[retail]] [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]], as well as any [[real property]] owned by the sole proprietor.
* '''Partnership:'''  A [[partnership]] is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are [[general partnership]]s, [[limited partnership]]s, and [[limited liability partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|doi=10.5465/amj.2013.0581 |title=Friends and Profits Don't Mix: The Performance Implications of Repeated Partnerships |journal=Academy of Management Journal |volume=59 |issue=2 |page=460 |year=2014 |last1=Holloway |first1=S. S. |last2=Parmigiani |first2=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Corporation:'''  The owners of a [[corporation]] have [[limited liability]] and the business has a separate [[legal personality]] from its owners.  Corporations can be either [[State-owned enterprise|government-owned]] or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as [[nonprofit organization]]s. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its [[shareholder]]s, who elect a [[board of directors]] to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff.  A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either [[privately held company|privately held]] by a small group of individuals, or [[public company|publicly held]], with publicly traded [[Share (finance)|shares]] listed on a [[stock exchange]].
* '''Cooperative:''' Often referred to as a "co-op", a [[cooperative]] is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either [[Consumers' co-operative|consumer cooperatives]] or [[worker cooperative]]s. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of [[economic democracy]].
* [[Limited liability company|Limited liability companies (LLC)]], limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from [[business failure]] by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure US Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbusinesschamberofcommerce.blogspot.com/ Small Business Chamber of Commerce, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Franchises:''' A [[franchising|franchise]] is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/definition-franchise-business-4467.html Definition of a Franchise Business]&lt;/ref&gt;  Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse.  One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.&lt;ref&gt;h{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/1046669X.2011.533109|title=A Comparison of Retail Franchises, Independent Businesses, and Purchased Existing Independent Business Startups: Lessons from the Kauffman Firm Survey|journal=Journal of Marketing Channels|volume=18|page=3|year=2011|last1=Welsh|first1=Dianne H. B.|last2=Desplaces|first2=David E.|last3=Davis|first3=fAmy E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A [[Private company limited by guarantee|company limited by guarantee]]:'''  Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.  The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[Liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in [[England]]. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having [[share capital]].
* '''A [[Private company limited by shares|company limited by shares]]:'''  The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."&lt;ref name="Black's"&gt;Black's Law and lee Dictionary. Second Pocket Edition. Bryan A. Garner, editor. West. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of company is common in [[England]] and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
** [[Public company|publicly traded company]] or a
** [[privately held company]]
* '''A company limited by guarantee with a share capital:'''  A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.  This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A [[limited liability company]]:''' "A company—statutorily authorized in certain states—that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.&lt;ref name="Black's" /&gt; LLC structure has been called "hybrid" in that it "combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has "flow-through taxation to the members" and must be "dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp#ixzz2CEzgE239|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) Definition - Investopedia|author=root|work=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''An [[unlimited company]] with or without a share capital:''' A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.
''Less common types of companies are:''
* '''Companies formed by letters patent:'''  Most corporations by letters patent are ''[[Corporation sole|corporations sole]]'' and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
* '''[[Royal charter|Charter corporations]]:'''  Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies.  Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the [[Bank of England]] is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
* '''Statutory companies:'''  Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.
Note that "Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC ([[public limited company]]) indicates that its shares are widely held."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plc.asp|title=Investopedia - Public Limited Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the [[shareholder]]s. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some [[Offshore financial center|offshore jurisdictions]] have created special forms of [[offshore company]] in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include "[[Segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]" and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between '''[[Public limited company|public companies]]''' and '''[[Privately held company|private companies]]'''. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a [[stock exchange]] which imposes [[Listing (finance)|listing requirements]]/[[Listing Rules]] as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A [[parent company]] is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.

=== Finance ===
{{Main|Finance}}
Finance is a field that deals with the study of [[investments]]. It includes the dynamics of [[asset]]s and [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected [[rate of return]]. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: [[public finance]], [[corporate finance]] and [[personal finance]].

=== Manufacturing ===
{{Main|Manufacturing}}
[[Manufacturing]] is the production of [[merchandise]] for use or sale using labour and [[machine]]s, [[tool]]s, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from [[handicraft]] to [[High tech manufacturing|high tech]], but is most commonly applied to [[Industry|industrial]] production, in which [[raw material]]s are transformed into [[finished good]]s on a large scale.

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing}}
Marketing is defined by the [[American Marketing Association]] as ''"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."''&lt;ref&gt;Marketing definition approved in October 2007 by the [[American Marketing Association]]: [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/DefinitionofMarketing.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services.  Marketing tactics include [[advertising]] as well as determining product [[pricing]].

With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called [[digital marketing]]. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.

=== Research and development ===
{{Main|Research and development}}
Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Safety ===
{{Main|Safety}}
Safety is a key business concept that is defined by [[Merriam-Webster]] as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/safety Definition of "safety"], [[Merriam-Webster]], updated February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, J.

The efficient and effective [[Business operations|operation of a business]], and study of this subject, is called [[management]]. The major branches of management are [[finance|financial management]], [[marketing]] management, [[organizational studies|human resource management]], [[strategic management]], [[manufacturing|production management]], [[operations management]], [[service management]], and [[information technology management]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources.  These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Restructuring state enterprises ===
In recent decades, states modeled some of their [[asset]]s and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the [[People's Republic of China]] modeled 80% of its [[state-owned enterprise]]s on a company-type management system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/data/China_in_brief/Economy/Major%20Industries.html Major Industries]. People.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.

Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.{{who|date=October 2013}} &lt;!-- also what does this have to do with state enterprises? --&gt;

== Organization and regulation ==
{{See also|Theory of the firm}}
Most legal [[jurisdiction]]s specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of [[commercial law]] for each type.

The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

* '''The size and scope of the business firm''' and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the [[theory of the firm]]. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a [[stock market]] or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
* '''The sector and country.''' Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
* '''[[Tax advantage]]s.''' Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.
* '''Disclosure and compliance requirements'''. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of [[shareholder]]s, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from [[Legal liability|personal liability]] for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.

Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a ''sole proprietor'', whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.

A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

# General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
# Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called [[double taxation]], because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
# In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
# "Going public" through a process known as an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public [[Limited liability company|LLC's]] that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, [[real estate investment trust]]s in the USA, and [[unit trust]]s in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

=== Commercial law ===
{{Main|Corporate law}}
[[File:Downtownplazala.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Office]]s in the [[Los Angeles]] Downtown Financial District]]
A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to [[Freight transport|shipping]] costs and dealings between merchants and [[broker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/assyria/hammurabi.html|title=Law Code of Hammurabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "corporation" derives from the Latin ''corpus'', meaning body, and the [[Maurya Empire]] in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/cbl/Khanna_Ancient_India_informal.pdf |title=The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India |author=Vikramaditya S. Khanna |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095432/http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/cbl/Khanna_Ancient_India_informal.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, [[Health and Safety Executive|worker protection and safety]], discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage,  as well as [[Trade union|unions]], worker compensation, and working hours and leave.

Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.

Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, [[Public utility|public utilities]], investment securities, banking, insurance, [[broadcasting]], [[aviation]], and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.

=== Capital ===
[[File:Bolsa Mexicana de Valores.png|thumb|left|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] in [[Paseo de la Reforma]], Mexico City]] When businesses need to raise money (called [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), they sometimes offer [[Security (finance)|securities]] for sale.

Capital may be raised through private means, by an [[initial public offering]] or IPO on a [[stock exchange]], or in other ways.

Major stock exchanges include the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], [[Singapore Exchange]], [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]], [[New York Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]] (the USA), the [[London Stock Exchange]] (UK), the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] (Japan), and [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.

Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).

The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.

Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.

=== Intellectual property ===
{{Main|Intellectual property}}
Businesses often have important "[[intellectual property]]" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, or preservation of [[trade secret]]s. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international [[treaty|treaties]] concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.

=== Trade union ===
{{Main|Trade union}}
A trade union (or labor union) is an [[Political organisation#Labour unions|organization of workers]] who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better [[working conditions]]. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt: rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates [[Labour and employment law|labor contracts]] ([[collective bargaining]]) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their [[employment]]".&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Sidney |last2=Webb|first2= Beatrice |title=History of Trade Unionism |publisher=Longmans and Co. London |year=1920}} ch. I&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the negotiation of [[wage]]s, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] and policies.

The '''Canadian Astronomical Society''' (CASCA; {{lang-fr|link=yes|'''La Société Canadienne d'Astronomie'''}}) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] society of professional [[astronomer]]s, founded in 1971 and incorporated in 1983.  The society is devoted to the promotion and advancement of knowledge of the universe through research and education, and its membership is open to people with a professional involvement in astronomy and related sciences.

The main activities of the Society are its annual scientific meetings, the planning and realization of scientific projects, the support of the scientific activities of its members, and the dissemination of related information among members and other interested people.

== History ==
Before World War II, there were few professional astronomers in Canada. There were two government-run, national observatories, the [[Dominion Observatory]], which opened in 1905 in  [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] and the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]], which opened in 1918 in [[Saanich, British Columbia]]. In addition, the [[University of Toronto]]'s  [[David Dunlap Observatory]], which opened in 1935 in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], housed the only significant university faculty and the only centre for graduate studies in astronomy in Canada.

During this period, the most prominent astronomical organization in Canada was the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]], which counted both amateurs and professional astronomer as members. Canadians also held leadership positions and attended meetings of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS). Beginning with Ottawa in 1911, several Canadian cities hosted AAS meetings. Canada was also an early member of the [[International Astronomical Union]], with activities coordinated through the Dominion Observatory.

In the 1960s, University programmes in science expanded rapidly and astronomy groups and departments appeared across Canada. This influx of astronomers, along with the closure of the Dominion Observatory in 1970, created demand for a professional society of Canadian astronomers.

CASCA was founded in May 1971 by a committee of the Canadian government's [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and [[Helen Sawyer Hogg]] was elected as the first president. CASCA was incorporated in 1983 as a society of professional astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History| url = 
http://casca.ca/?page_id=53 | publisher = Canadian Astronomical Society  | accessdate = 8 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The quarterly newsletter of the Society, called ''Cassiopeia'' is published at [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s.

She was recently named among Oxford University’s [[Said Business School]]’s [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Entrepreneurship_Centre/Docs/ec-and-skoll-wall-of-fame-sep15.pdf 42 top graduate entrepreneurs.]
[[File:Elizabeth Filippouli Muna AbuSulayman Becky Anderson 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Dubai, UAE - November 2014: Elizabeth Filippouli with CNN's Becky Anderson and Entrepreneur &amp; Philanthropist Muna AbuSulayman]]

Filippouli's background is in media, having worked as a journalist with Greek press and TV and international organizations such as Al Jazeera English and CNN. She moved to Qatar in 2005 to join AJE as a presenter and correspondent and lives in London since 2007, dedicating time travelling for the needs of GT and GTF.
She serves on the boards of NewsXchange, the International News Safety Institute, and is also a member of the Royal Television Society and the Certified Institute of PR.

==Broadcasting==
As a journalist, Filippouli has been a member of the [[Al Jazeera English]] (AJE) launch team based in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]. She was the presenter of flagship programs, such as: ''People &amp; Power'', ''Witness'' and ''Crossroads Europe''. For AJE she also produced a number of documentaries, such as: ''Greekgate'' and ''Italygate'', investigating two espionage scandals of massive proportions which rocked the political systems in Italy and Greece.

Workshops, roundtables and networking events are organised under the editorial umbrella of GTF in various cities around the world. The Global Thinkers Forum advisory board features world acclaimed thought leaders and brands. Filippouli has coined the terms [[Digimocracy]] ('Digital Democracy' as a new form of participatory Democracy generated by ICT) and [[Globonomy]] (the term refers to the reality of a globalized economy and the various collaboration and other needs pushing towards the formation of a new economic model). Filippouli is a regular speaker at international conferences discussing leadership issues and global trends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4670">'''Esteban José Handal Pérez''' (born 7 January 1965 in [[San Pedro Sula]]) is a Honduran politician and businessman who is also known as the "Red Bull."&lt;ref name="LT"&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=132337 La Tribuna (Honduras), 16 May 2010, accessed 27 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the former President of the Liberal Youth of Honduras and previously sought the nomination to be a Honduran Presidential candidate on behalf of the Liberal Party. He served in the national parliament of Honduras from 1997 to 2001. He is currently leader of the United Liberal Movement and has announced that he will seek the leadership of the Liberal Party in the internal elections scheduled for 2012.

==Biography==
Esteban José Handal Pérez was born in San Pedro Sula, in the department of Cortes, Honduras.

==Education==
Handal Pérez studied at the International School in Sampedrana in his home city. He completed his studies at the [[University of Texas]] and the [[Louisiana State University]], graduating in Industrial Engineering in 1987.

==Political career==
Shortly after his graduation from University, Handal returned to Honduras and became involved in politics supporting the then presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, Carlos Roberto Flores in 1989, although Roberto Flores lost to the National Party candidate, Rafael Leonardo Callejas. Handal was elected President of the Liberal Youth of San Pedro Sula in 1989. Subsequently he was campaign coordinator for Ramon Villeda Bermudez and in August 1993 participated in the Congress of Liberal Youth where he was elected president of the Liberal Youth, serving until 2001. In 1997 he won the nomination for Congress and was elected in the [[Honduran general election, 1997|1997 General election]] for the constituency of Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=137520 Interview in La Tribuna, 29 May 2010] accessed 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as deputy, he emphasized always being firm with his convictions, but shortly after winning the Provincial Council, he was nominated by the Liberal Party as a presidential candidate with the "New Generation" movement. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During his presidential campaign, people began calling him "the Red Bull," a nickname that is recognized throughout Honduras.

During his presidential campaign, Mr. Esteban Handal Perez revamped "the renewal of the Liberal Party of Honduras with young men and women in thought, the democratization of the Liberal Party, the rescue of the liberal principles, and the guarantee of food, health, education, employment, security, and shelter for all Hondurans," among other things. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In the internal elections of the Liberal Party on 3 December 2000, Esteban Handal Pérez, the "Red Bull", received 150,000 votes, which no were not sufficient at that time to win the nomination for the Presidency by the Liberal Party. Professor Rafael Pineda Ponce lost in the general election to Ricardo Maduro Joest of the National Party. After the elections, Esteban Handal temporarily retired from politics to dedicate himself to pastoral and entrepreneurial work.

On 16 May 2010, he publicly announced in an interview with "La Tribuna," a newspaper, his intention to return to national politics and run for the Presidency as a Liberal. He justified his return with the sentiment that "the Honduran people need profound changes in the political system and also because I believe that there should be a greater social awareness by large majorities"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=132337 Vuelve el "Toro Colorado"]&lt;/ref&gt; and their lack of involvement in the events of 28 June 2009. Mr. Handal Pérez currently leads the Liberal Unity Movement and has publicly declared its intention to run in the presidential elections in 2012, with the intentions of "the construction of a new Honduras, with more opportunities for all, more democratic, more free, more developed, more just, and more worthy." {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Gabriel Milan''' (or Gavrī'el Mil'ō (גבריאל מילאו), ''c'' 1631 &amp;ndash; 26 March 1689) was governor of the [[Danish West Indies]] (now known as the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) from 7 May 1684 to 27 February 1686. Though he mainly went by the name of 'Gabriel Milan', he identified himself as '''''Don Franco de Tebary Cordova''''' in his correspondence with King [[Frederick III of Denmark]]. Like many of the early Danish West Indies governors, Milan's term was short and stormful, as he disagreed with the Danish management on several issues. He was called to Denmark after less than two years and executed after a lengthy trial.

== Early life ==
Milan came from a reputable [[Sephardic Jew]]ish family, likely from [[Spain]], and had connections in [[Portugal]], [[Flanders]], and [[Hamburg]]. Some genealogists note that he is the son of Manuel Cardoso de Millao and Sara de Caceres.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, [http://www.heymannfamily.com/web/HeymannGed4Web-J6/n_2efa.html#0 Heymann Family Web Site], accessed February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, his family was forced into a [[Catholic]] [[baptism]],&lt;ref&gt;Terslin, Milan, 9&lt;/ref&gt; however, they had re-assumed their Jewish identity by the time of Milan's life.&lt;ref&gt;Locker, 'Yehūdīm', 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan was first married to the daughter of [[Benjamin Musaphia]], a [[Jew]]ish scholar and author of a number of scientific works regarding [[archaeology]], [[Semitic languages|Semite]] [[philology]], and [[alchemy]].  His wife's given name was not recorded in any sources, except that her last name was [[De Castro]] and her family's [[coat of arms]] depicted a [[negro]] head.&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 10"&gt;Terslin, Milan, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his family was related by marriage to the well-known [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-Jewish houses of [[da Costa]].&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 10"/&gt; Among the people connected to this family was [[Emanuel Teixiera Cardosa de Milan]] (also known as ''Isaac Haim Senior Teixeira'' &amp;ndash; d. 1705), a wealthy merchant of the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg]] who was Milan's uncle by marriage. Another of Milan's uncles was [[Moseh Abenzur]], a shipowner and [[Jewellery|jeweller]] who was also known by the names, ''Paulo de Milao,'' ''Milan'', and ''Poul Didricksen''.&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 13"&gt;Terslin, Milan, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Moseh's oldest son, [[Josua Abenzur]], was the brother-in-law of Milan and in his early dealings, Milan often borrowed money from Josua.

Milan begun his career as a soldier, notably as a [[colonel]] in the Spanish [[cavalry]] in Flanders (1654–55).  He participated in the [[Thirty Years' War]] on the [[Spain|Spanish]] side against [[France]] in 1657,&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 13"/&gt; and fought at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of Dunkerque]]. During this period, Milan was living in [[Brussels]] and later served under [[Cardinal Mazarin]].

In 1667, Milan was an [[Amsterdam]] merchant, concerned with financing [[Prince George of Denmark]].  In 1668, he was made Danish [[Factor (agent)|Factor]], and, in 1670, Factor-General in Amsterdam.  In this capacity, Milan composed reports on political and commercial matters, which afforded him confidential relations with various important people at the Danish Court. Here Milan learned to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Milan's first wife died in 1675, leaving behind two children.  Shortly thereafter, Milan married the widow [[Juliane Regina von Breitenbach]]. With Juliane, Milan had five children (see [[#The children of Gabriel Milan|The children of Gabriel Milan]]).

By 1684, the affairs of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] were moving too swiftly for the comfort of the directors at Copenhagen.  [[George Iversen]], the first Governor of St. Thomas, recounted that he was forced to conform to [[Adolph Esmit]] and later, Esmit's older brother, [[Nicolai Esmit|Nicolai]], and was held in his office until a new incumbent was secured.  The patience of the English government was exhausted, and they had no interest in hearing Esmit's complaints.  At a [[shareholders' meeting]] on March 10, the directors of the Danish company were asked to choose a new Governor.

Two candidates presented themselves, Balthasar Lachmann, who was an [[auditor]], and Gabriel Milan.  Milan was selected because for his [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge and business ability.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation, dated March 14, was signed by the executive committee of the directors, consisting of [[Albert Gyldensparre]], a brother of the disgraced Count Griffenfeld; Abraham Wüst, later to become a member of the Board of Trade; and Edward Holst.  On May 7, 1684, the King issued an order that deposed Adolph Esmit and named Gabriel Milan as Governor of St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Christian V. to A. Esmit.  A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governorship ==
To take the new governorship and his retinue over to the West Indies, the King set aside the warship ''Fortuna'', armed with forty guns, and provided the ship with a crew of eighty men. Captain George Meyer, a German-speaking officer who was in the Danish service for five years, commanded the boat.  Milan brought his family (his wife; his grown son, Felix; and his other four children), a [[governess]], three [[maid]]s, three [[Lackey (manservant)|lackeys]] and [[Labour (economics)|laborer]], and a [[Tartars|Tartar]].&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The directors also sent Niels Lassen as Lieutenant Governor of sorts, and John Lorentz to serve as an assistant.

Lavish provisions were made for the Governor's comfort. Various foreign wines were on board, and place was found for six to seven dogs.  The King furnished Milan with 6,000 [[Danish West Indian rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] (rdl) cash for Milan's immediate needs and gave him part of his salary in advance.  Captain Meyer was entrusted with the secret order directing that, in case of Milan's death, Lassen would succeed him as the Governor.  In case of Lassen's death, Lieutenant [[Christopher Heins]] of St. Thomas would take charge.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan tried in vain to get an appointment to the Board of Trade on the ground that he knew the tricks of traders and [[Bureau de Change|money-changers]], and he accumulated a list of claims against his royal master for services rendered in the [[Netherlands]] &amp;mdash; from [[espionage]] to loans of money &amp;mdash; which he had small chance of collecting in cash.   His prospects of getting into the employ of the state were improved when, on January 18, 1682, he secured a certificate showing that he had discussed with a Hamburg [[Lutheran]] minister the relative merits of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], and thereby become convinced of the truth of the [[Augsburg Confession]], and partook of the [[Holy Communion]]. In depending upon the favor of princes, he had been forced, even before his appointment as Governor, to drink deep from the cup of misfortune.  However praiseworthy the King's selection of this 53-year-old [[Mercenary|soldier of fortune]] for service in the company might have been from motives of [[Compassion|humanity]], his choice could scarcely have been looked upon by hard-headed business men with anything but misgivings.

The ''Fortuna'' arrived at [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] on October 13, 1684, after a voyage of about nine weeks.&lt;ref name="Krarup, Milan, 6"&gt;Krarup, Milan, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Nevis]] Milan called on October 6 to pay his respects to Governor Stapleton and to receive the latter's "instruction".  Sir William seems to have availed himself of the opportunity to accompany Milan and to witness Adolph Esmit's final disgrace. Esmit handed over the reins of office without delay or resistance. He also handed over a treasury so empty that when the English were ready to depart, after having been entertained for ten days, the money needed for the purchase of parting gifts for English dignitaries had to be borrowed by the government from a planter. What was worst of all, Esmit handed over to Milan an island that had become an outlaw among its more reputable neighbors. This was shown clearly enough two months before the latter's arrival, when, on May 22, a Spanish captain, Antonio Martino, landed and carried fifty-six slaves off to [[Hispaniola]] or [[Haiti]]. Lieutenant Heins had been sent over with two planters to demand the return of the loot, but without success.&lt;ref name="Krarup, Milan, 6"/&gt;

That Esmit had been prepared for the present contingency there could be no doubt. The gold, silver, and other property that he was able to scrape together had been sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] island of [[St. Eustatius]], whence they were to be shipped to [[Vlissingen|Flushing]]. Although Milan had been instructed only to secure the persons of Esmit and his family and to have them sent to Copenhagen, he took it upon himself to try to secure the latter's property as well, by sending Niels Lassen to [[Louis Houtcooper|Governor Houtcooper]] of St. Eustatius with an alleged copy of his instructions and a demand for the delivery of the goods. But neither this nor subsequent attempts availed the crafty governor. Instead of seeking redress through diplomatic channels, as his masters expected him to do, he authorized Captain Delicaet to take the company's ship ''Charlotte Amalie'' (named after [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel]] or Hesse-Cassel), find the skipper who had transported the goods and make his ship lawful prize.&lt;ref&gt;Personalhistorisk Tidskrift, 3 R. 2 B., 9. The skipper's name was Jochum Samuelsen.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to avoid just this sort of complication that Esmit had been displaced. But Milan was an exponent of direct action, he sought advice from none, and the council dared not oppose his will.

Instead of sending his deposed predecessor back to Copenhagen to answer for his stewardship over the company's affairs, and to act as defendant in a suit brought by his brother Nicholas, he clapped him into confinement, first keeping him at the fort as his guest, but later putting him in a prison cell.&lt;ref&gt;Esmit to Gyldensparre (September 23, 1686). A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Esmit had rightly decided that she could be more useful in Copenhagen than in St. Thomas and had started on her journey before Milan arrived. By this time, matters had grown rather beyond her power of control despite all her influential friends and her genius for intrigue, so she confined herself to taking measures to save what she could of the family property. She returned to St. Thomas in December to share the hardships of prison life with her husband.

The story of how Governor Milan, his sick body racked with fever almost from the first, restlessly suspicious and ofttimes with reason of his fellow men, jealous of his official power and position, administered the affairs of St. Thomas during his sixteen months' incumbency may be dealt with rather briefly. In Captain Meyer's attempt to provide the Fortuna,  with a good return cargo, the governor took but an indifferent interest, and as to the Esmits' returning on the Fortuna, he would have none of it. Just why he should deliberately keep with him persons who could not but be a source of trouble as long as they were near, is difficult to explain on other grounds than cupidity. Milan had been unable to lay his hands on Esmit's gains. In his relations with his council, he showed his arbitrariness and wilfulness. In place of Lieutenant Heins, who happened to be absent on the company's business when Milan arrived, the governor promptly appointed his son, Felix.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of selecting permanent councilors from among the planters as he had been instructed to do under certain specified conditions, he put in now one, now another, until fourteen planters had taken part in the government with him.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other planters Milan was equally whimsical. For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser man would have overlooked the whole matter.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 12, 23, 26, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Offending negroes were made to feel the pressure of the governor's heavy hand. A runaway who might have been mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.

When in the spring following the departure of the Fortuna (on March 31, 1685), Milan got wind of what he at once suspected to be a nefarious plot against his life, he vented his fury upon the unfortunate persons with swift and fiendish vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of charges and counter-charges, one fact stood out with a clearness that was unmistakable. Milan's stewardship of his own plantation property was above reproach; seventy negroes remained on the plantation even after twenty-five had been returned to an Englishman from whom they had been forcibly seized.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here prosperity was rife.

In Copenhagen, Captain Meyer's arrival was naturally awaited with a good deal of interest, even anxiety.  The captain's report when he arrived on June 10, 1685, without Adolph Esmit, and even without a word from Milan, gave the directors and shareholders food for thought. Although they had only the captain's unsupported word, the small cargo and Milan's silence could not but rouse their fears that something was seriously wrong at St. Thomas. A meeting of the Company's shareholders was held within two days, and it was decided that the situation was serious enough to justify sending a memorial to the king asking once more for the loan of the Fortuna,  and for the sending thence of a commissioner with power to settle all the difficulties. They suggested an attorney or fiscal in the navy department, [[Mikkel Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariager MS., 49, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The king could do nothing but fall in with the company's recommendations.

Commissioner Mikkelsen, armed with full power, left Copenhagen on the Fortuna October 15, 1685, touched at Nevis on February 19 to get the latest St. Thomas advices, and arrived at his destination on February 24, 1686. The governor's son, Ferdinand, had already sent his father a warning from Copenhagen that it was planned to send out a new governor, namely, Captain Meyer, whom the governor had blamed for most of his misfortunes, even his illness. Milan, whose nerves had scarcely recovered from the shock of the "conspiracy," called the planters together in the "German" &lt;!--Dutch Reformed?--&gt; church. There he informed them of this last "conspiracy," namely, the attempt to place this "rascal" Mikkelsen in the governor's seat "whom he ought to be hanged to the highest tree.".&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He counselled resistance, exhorted their aid, and by cajolings and threats secured their signatures to a document by which they pledged themselves to leave the land before they would see their governor leave them.

But if he proposed to give battle, he needed to secure the sinews of war. He chose a method consistent with his nature. On February 17, 1686, just as the royal commissioner was approaching the West Indian Waters, the governor authorized Captain Daniel Moy to take the company's ship, Charlotte Amalia, and  cruise upon the Spaniards wherever they might be of thirty men; Captain Moy put to sea to make war upon the kingdom of Spain. The Charlotte Amalia had no difficulty in finding a Spanish ship on the Porto Rico coast, but the latter vessel had the temerity to answer Captain Moy's fire, wounding one man, killing another, and forcing the valiant captain to beat a nasty retreat to St. Thomas. It was withal an inglorious ending to a sorry enterprise, and not calculated to redeem the good name of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commissioners had arrived in the harbor before the news of the "reprisal" fiasco could reach the governor, and before his "valet," Moses Caille, could return from the French islands, whence he had been sent by the desperate governor in search of help.&lt;ref&gt;Caille's mission appears to have borne no fruit beyond arousing the Spaniards.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitting in his private room and surrounded by all manner of firearms, the governor drew the parley out for three days before he finally surrendered to the king's representative. Mikkelsen's intimation that Milan's attitude rendered him liable to the charge of rebellion, combined with the fact that the men on whom he could depend  were rapidly diminishing in number, brought the governor to his knees. A guard consisting of twelve men from the Fortuna and twelve planters, all under the command of Christopher Heins, was placed at the fort. With his removal to the ship, the reign of Gabriel Milan came to a sudden end. Adolph Esmit and his wife, Charity, likewise the company's merchant, Niels Lassen, who had been in prison since April 30, were taken out of their dungeons and put on board ship. The scene of interest, as far as the company is concerned, was soon to shift to Copenhagen. Nicholas Esmit had already lost his wits while in a Copenhagen prison waiting for a chance to clear himself and to bring action against his brother. The two successors of Nicholas were now to be given a chance to defend their official actions in the Danish courts and before the directors of the company.

Commissioner Mikkelsen was employed from March until July with collecting evidence from the planters concerning Milan's conduct. A few extracts  from a letter written by the official reporter, Andrew Brock, to director Albert Gyldensparre on June 30, 1686, just before the Fortuna sailed, will give an idea of the proceedings. "I wish for my part that your Excellency could have been here a single day and heard what thundering there has been in the commission, with howling, shouting, and screaming, one against the other, and I had to write it into the protocol just as fast [as they spoke] . . . but God be thanked it is over, and former Lieutenant Christopher Heins was yesterday made governor and vice commandant here. May God in heaven aid him to carry on his government better than his predecessors, which I expect him to do, as he has shown himself only as an honest and upright man. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;B. &amp; D., 1683-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan himself dictated a letter to the directors in justification of his conduct in which he vented his wrath on those inhabitants and employees who had attested to his zeal and faithfulness, but were now shouting, "Crucify him, crucify him!" The letters of the two prisoners, Esmit and Lassen, which were sent over at the same time, bore out on the whole the testimony of the planters, whose sympathies were on the side of those two victims of Milan's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Esmit to Directors; Lassen to same (March 13, 1686). A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and death ==
Mikkelsen left St. Thomas with his rather uncongenial company on July 5, and did not arrive in Copenhagen until October 12, 1686. Besides the two governors with their families and negro servants, the list of passengers included Niels Lassen, Gerhart Philipsen, and John Lorentz, whose testimony was desired in the suits. A commission was appointed within a week to try the case against Milan, but delays in getting the tangled evidence straightened prevented a decision being reached before November 17, 1687. An appeal to the Supreme Court brought further delays, but finally the case was opened on February 14, 1689. The judges rendered their individual opinions on March 14, and judgment was finally pronounced on March 21. The sentence was not a surprise to those who had followed the case. After a fair, impartial trial Gabriel Milan was found guilty and condemned to lose his property, honor, and life, and his head and hand were to be put upon a stake.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon saved him from the last grim disgrace,&lt;ref&gt;Queen Charlotte Amalia had earlier befriended Madame Milan, and was one of the "chief participants" in the company. She had helped to mitigate Commissioner Mikkelsen's instructions, and may have used her good offices here,&lt;/ref&gt; and at dawn on March 26, 1689, he was beheaded on [[Nytorv]] Square in Copenhagen.

== Succession ==
Adolph Esmit's long imprisonment both on St. Thomas and in Copenhagen in 1686 and 1687 had given him grounds for appearing as the injured party, and for demanding some form of restitution. While the Milan trial was dragging slowly on, the former governor and his wife seemed  to have been kept in prison in Copenhagen. From their arrival on October 12, 1686, until March, 1687, when Nicholas' case against his brother was finally ready for trial, they remained in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;Adolph's "brothers-in-law", Steen Andersen Bille and Jürgen Jürgensen, gave bonds for his appearance. A. E., 1682&amp;ndash;89 (March 25, 1687).&lt;/ref&gt; Here, as in the case of Milan, a commission was appointed,&lt;ref&gt;Jens Juel, Mathias Moth, Muhle and Höyer.&lt;/ref&gt; and although a number of petty irregularities and cases of tampering with accounts were found, Adolph Esmit was on November 2, 1687, given a verdict of not guilty.

On the same day, the directors of the company named him governor of St. Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;One condition was that he should invest 2,000 rdl. within one year after he took possession at St. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later a fleet of three ships, the ''Young Tobias'', ''the Red Cock'' (''Den Røde Hane'') and the ''Maria'' left Copenhagen for the West Indies. Accompanying Adolph Esmit, and in command of the fleet, was vice-admiral Iver Hoppe who seems to have had secret orders to being Esmit back with him to Denmark in case he proved intractable.

In 1689, the governor and council proposed that a sugar mill should be put up on Milan's former plantation, and ventured the opinion that if sugar cane should prove successful on the Company's plantations, it would prove more profitable than cotton or tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions of governor and council (February 19, 1689). The members of the council were Henry Irgens, Joachim Delicaet, John de Windt, and John Lorentz.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5922">A '''labour council''', '''trades council''' or '''industrial council''' is an association of [[trade union|labour union]]s or [[local union|union branches]] in a given area. Most commonly, they represent unions in a given geographical area, whether at the district, city, region, or provincial or state level. They may also be based on a particular industry rather than geographical area, as for example, in the ''Maritime Council of Australia'' which co-ordinated the waterfront and maritime unions involved in the [[1890 Australian Maritime Dispute]].

Affiliates of labour councils are [[trade union]] branches or locals, and occasionally other [[labour movement]] organisations. Citywide or provincial councils may have district or regional labour council affiliates as well as trade unions. Some labour councils restrict their membership to organisations  which are affiliated with a particular national [[trade union federation]], such as many state-level labour councils in the [[United States]], which are chartered from the [[AFL-CIO]] national confederation.

Finances are usually obtained through an affiliation fee, often based on a per capita tax on the membership of affiliates. In Australia, ''Trades and Labour Councils'' often have their own hall and offices known as a [[Trades Hall]], with the term ''Trades Hall'' often used as a colloquial expression for the ''Labour Council'' or ''Trades Hall Council''.

==Note on usage==
Labour councils are a widespread phenomenon, but are given different names in different English-speaking areas. ''Labour Council'' is most common in Canada and Australia, ''Labor Council'' is used in the (USA) and ''Trades Council'', ''Trades Union Council'' or ''Trades and Labour Council'' in the United Kingdom (and until recently was widespread in Australia) and some other countries. Another term sometimes used is ''Industrial Council'', as in for example, the [[Barrier Industrial Council]] of [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in Australia.

National associations of trade unions, such as British [[Trade Union Congress]] may also be considered a labour council, though the term often implies a primarily local organisation.

==History==

''Labour Councils'' were formed to meet a need to co-ordinate trade union activity in a geographical region. The earliest examples of this form of organisation can be found in the medieval craft [[guild]]s and Craft halls that developed in European cities. An example of this is the historic [[Glasgow Trades Hall]] wherein the 14 Incorporated Trades of Hammermen, Tailors, Cordiners, Maltmen, Weavers, Bakers, Skinners, Wrights, Coopers, Fleshers, Masons, Gardeners, Barbers, Bonnetmakers &amp; Dyers yearly elected members of the Trades House, headed by the Deacon Convener of the Trades:

:''The Trades House of Glasgow was created at the time of reform of Glasgow's local government in 1605. At that time the electorate was basically divided into two groups, the Merchants and the Craftsmen. The Craft Incorporations or Guilds comprised the trades Rank of Burgesses under the leadership of the deacon convener, who was given a council. This included the Craft leaders and is the body we now recognise as the Trades House.'' [https://archive.is/20060413225709/http://www.tradeshouse.org.uk/about.php]

The trade union activity of the late nineteenth century in particular spurred the establishment of Labour Councils and Trades Councils acrossing North America, Australia and Britain.

Some notable events in the history of ''labour councils'' include:

* 1791 - 1794 - [[Glasgow Trades Hall]] built to serve as a public hall and meeting place for the city’s Trades House &amp; 14 Incorporated Crafts.
* 1834 - attempt to establish the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]] in Britain.
* 1856 - Melbourne Trades Hall Committee formed. Now known as [[Victorian Trades Hall Council]]
* 1858 - trades councils started forming in major British towns and cities.

* 1859 - [[Melbourne Trades Hall]] opened in May.
* 1860 - [[London Trades Council]] founded.
* 1861 - [[Dundee Trades Union Council]] founded.
* 1864 - [[Manchester and Salford Trades Council]] formed.
* 1868 - First [[Trades Union Congress]] called by ''Manchester and Salford Trades Council'' in [[Manchester]], with invitations being sent to  "''trades councils and other similar federations of trade societies''" only.
* 1871 - [[Labor Council of New South Wales|Trades &amp; Labor Council of Sydney]] formed.
* 1893 - [[San Francisco Labor Council]] chartered.
* 1895 - [[Trades Union Congress]] (Britain) restricted to ''unions'', with ''trades councils'' excluded altogether to avoid dual representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1453">"'''Labour is not a commodity'''" is the principle expressed in the preamble to the [[International Labour Organization]]'s founding documents. It expresses the view that people should not be treated like inanimate [[commodities]], [[Human capital|capital]], another mere [[factor of production]], or [[Human resources|resources]]. Instead, people who work for a living should be treated as [[human being]]s and accorded [[dignity]] and respect.

'''Levent''' is a neighbourhood and one of the main [[business district]]s of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], located on the [[Europe]]an side of the city. It is a part of the municipality of [[Beşiktaş]] which is situated to the north of the [[Golden Horn]], at the western shore of the [[Bosphorus]] [[strait]].

Levent is in direct competition with the nearby [[Maslak]] business district for new [[skyscraper]] projects. One of the major skyscraper clusters of the city is located here, well hidden behind the hills of the [[Bosphorus]], and not disturbing the atmosphere of the [[Constantinople|historical peninsula]] of Istanbul, which is at quite a distance.

Levent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100015 Emporis: Levent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314100018/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100015 |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hosts the tallest completed skyscraper of Turkey, the 54-floor [[Istanbul Sapphire|Sapphire]],&lt;ref name=Sapphire&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=kilertower-istanbul-turkey Emporis: Sapphire]&lt;/ref&gt; which has a roof height of 238 metres (261 metres including its spire).&lt;ref name=Sapphire/&gt;

The stations ''Gayrettepe'', ''Levent'' and ''4. Levent'' along the [[M2 (Istanbul Metro)|M2]] line of the [[Istanbul Metro]] serve the Levent business district and its surrounding neighbourhoods.

==Etymology==
[[File:LeventPano3.jpg|thumb|left|Büyükdere Avenue in Levent, with the [[Finansbank]] headquarters (formerly Soyak Crystal Tower) at right.]]

Levent is also a name for men in Turkey (cf. [[Levent (name)|Levent]]) that derives from the ''[[Levend]]'', a type of soldier ([[marines|naval infantry]]) of the [[Ottoman Navy]].&lt;ref name=Levend&gt;[http://www.barbaros.biz/OSMANLI_DONANMASI_KIYAFETLERI.htm Kıyafet-i Asakir-i Bahriyye: Costumes and ranks of the Ottoman Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levend'' itself has derived from ''Levantino'' ([[Levant]]ine) which means ''Person from the [[Levant]] (East Mediterranean)'' in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name=Levend/&gt;&lt;ref name=DAFN&gt;Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-508137-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was how the Italians (the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]) used to call the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sailors, a name which was also adopted by the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref name=Levend/&gt;&lt;ref name=DAFN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nisanyan&gt;[[Sevan Nişanyan]]. ''Sözlerin Soyağacı: Çağdaş Türkçenin Etimolojik Sözlüğü''. URL: http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/search.asp?w=levent{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 30 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''levend'' for describing seamen first appeared in the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Nisanyan/&gt; These marine soldiers had the reputation of possessing strong, muscular physiques and daring, fearless characters; which is the reason why the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''levent'', its [[Greek language|Greek]] [[cognate]] ''[[Leventis|levénti]]'' (λεβέντη) and its [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] cognate ''levént'' (левент) are still popularly used for defining "athletic, gallant, brave" men.&lt;ref name=DAFN/&gt;

The name Levent (''Levend'') came to be applied to the neighbourhood because in 1780 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Kapudan Pasha|Fleet Admiral]] [[Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha]] was awarded a farmland here by the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdülhamid I]]; and in the early 19th century a military compound was built in the area of this farm.&lt;ref&gt;Haldun Hürel. ''Semtleri, Mahalleri, Caddeleri ve Sokakları A'dan Z'ye İstanbul'un Alfabetik Öyküsü''. İkarus, 2008. {{ISBN|978-975-999-290-3}}. Page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[İstinye]] neighbourhood on the European shoreline of the [[Bosphorus]] also featured an important shipyard and dock for maintaining and repairing the military vessels of the [[Ottoman Navy]]. However, the [[Imperial Arsenal (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Arsenal]] (''Tersâne-i Âmire'') and the Naval Ministry (''Bahriye Nezareti'') of the Ottoman Navy were located on the shores of the [[Golden Horn]].

==History==
[[File:KanyonTower.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kanyon Shopping Mall|Kanyon Towers &amp; Mall]] on Büyükdere Avenue in Levent, with [[Istanbul Sapphire]] in the background.]]
[[File:The Bosphorus Bridge (8425286568).jpg|thumb|Heading towards Levent through the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] and [[Otoyol 1|O-1 motorway]].]]

In the early 19th century, during the final years of the reign of Sultan [[Selim III]], the first military compound of the [[Nizam-ı Cedid|Nizam-ı Cedid (New Order) Army]] was built in Levent; which was then known as the ''Levend Çiftliği'' (Levend Farmlands), eventually becoming known as the ''Levend Kışlası'' (Levend Barracks).

In 1868, during the first territorial organization of the Istanbul Municipality, Levend (Levent) was placed within the district of [[Beşiktaş]] (which was designated as the ''7th Area'' of the Istanbul Municipality), having remained within this district ever since.

The modern neighbourhood of Levent was formed in 1947, when Emlak Kredi Bankası (a Turkish bank which was established to finance housing projects) chose the Levent area for constructing a well-planned residential compound, formed mostly of [[villa]] type houses with gardens. After the completion of the first phase of the Levent project in 1960, numerous other residential compounds were constructed in the area, eventually extending towards nearby [[Etiler]].

Starting from the late 1980s and early 1990s, with initial projects such as the [[Sabancı Center]], [[Yapı ve Kredi Bankası|Yapı Kredi Towers]], TAT Towers, [[MetroCity AVM|Metrocity Towers]] and [[Isbank Tower 1|İş Bankası Towers]], Levent became a popular location for constructing new [[skyscraper]]s, mostly owned by Turkish [[bank]]s and [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. One of the city's major [[skyline]] clusters (together with those of [[Maslak]] and [[Şişli]] on the European side; and [[Ataşehir]] and [[Kozyatağı]] on the Asian side of Istanbul) is located in Levent. At present, Levent hosts the tallest skyscraper of Istanbul and Turkey, the 54-floor [[Istanbul Sapphire]]; while the construction of numerous new [[mixed-use development|mixed-use skyscraper projects]] and [[shopping mall]]s are ongoing in the neighbourhood, which has evolved into a [[central business district]].

'''Lex Brown''' (born [[Maybole]], Ayrshire) is a Scottish businessman. A former [[Military awards and decorations of the United Kingdom|decorated]] [[RAF]] helicopter pilot,&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/the-first-time-he-saw-castle-tioram-he-almost-flew-a-helicopter-into-it-now-this-ex-raf-pilot-says-he-s-fighting-to-save-the-highland-landmark-so-who-is-lex-brown-and-why-is-there-such-hostility-to-his-pounds-4-5-million-plans-1.70728|title=The battle for Castle Tioram|last=Tierney|first=Michael|date=15 November 2004|work=The Herald|accessdate=27 June 2011|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came to public attention after buying [[Tioram Castle]], in [[Moidart]], for £300,000 in 1997.

There followed years of high-profile conflicts with [[Historic Scotland]], [[Highland Council]] and other interested parties,&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/12-years-and-a-few.5646132.jp|title=12 years and a few millions later, Lex Brown may soon be king of his castle|last=Ross|first=John|date=15 September 2009|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=27 June 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[public inquiry]] in 2002 and an appeal to the [[Scottish Government]] in 2006.
Following a change of personnel at Historic Scotland.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article3075553.ece|title=Tycoon is king of the castle after winning battle to restore ancient clan stronghold|last=Drainey|first=Nick|date=27 June 2011|work=The Times|accessdate=27 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown renewed discussions with HS of his plans to reroof and live in Castle Tioram, though these are still at an early stage.&lt;ref name="Historic Scotland"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/indepth/castletioram.htm|title=Castle Tioram|work=Historic Scotland web pages|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown was mostly brought up overseas, in Egypt and Ghana, where his father worked as a civil engineer.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt; His [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic-speaking]], west highland mother endowed Brown with a respect for his [[highland heritage]].

After 20 years in the armed forces, Brown farmed on [[Loch Lomondside]] before making a fortune in the [[air cargo]] and [[oil exploration]] business.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt;

'''Lima''' is a [[Districts of Peru|district]] of [[Lima Province]] in [[Peru]]. It is, however, not the [[Central business district]] of [[Lima]], the country's capital city: this is [[San Isidro District, Lima|San Isidro District]]. 

Lima district is the oldest in Lima and as such, vestiges of the city's [[Colonialism|colonial]] era remain today in the [[Historic centre of Lima]], which was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1988. This area is also known as '''Cercado de Lima''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "Walled Lima").

Currently, the [[mayor]] of the Lima District is [[Luis Castañeda Lossio]] and its [[postal code]] is '''1'''.

==Geography==

The district has a total land [[area]] of 21.98 km². Its administrative center is located at 154 meters above [[sea level]].

===Boundaries===
* North: The [[Rímac River]] marks the district's border with the [[San Martín de Porres District|San Martín de Porres]] and [[Rímac District|Rímac]] districts.
* East: [[El Agustino]]
* South: [[La Victoria District, Lima|La Victoria]], [[Lince District|Lince]], [[Jesús María District, Lima|Jesús María]], [[Breña]] and [[Pueblo Libre]].
* West: [[San Miguel District, Lima|San Miguel District]]; and the [[Callao Region]] districts of [[Bellavista District|Bellavista]], [[Callao District|Callao]] and [[Carmen de la Legua Reynoso]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:SanFranciscoDeAsis view1.jpg|thumb|left|San Francisco de Asís Church]]
According to a 2005 estimate by the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática|INEI]], the district has 278,804 inhabitants and a population density of 15,736.9 persons/km². In 1999, there were 75,595 households in the district.

The high point of Lima's religious calendar for the masses is a month of festivities in October dedicated to the [[Lord of Miracles]], during which take place several processions in the city.
[[Image:Solo anda.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Señor de los Milagros]]]]

==Neighborhoods==
Central Lima (known as '''Cercado''' proper) is limited by Avenida Alfonso Ugarte on the west and Jirón Huánuco (Huánuco Street) on the east. It is divided into West and East sides by Jirón de la Unión (Union Street), from which ''cuadras'' ([[city block|blocks]]) are numbered beginning at 100 and changing the first numbers at the next block. Unlike [[New York City|New York's]] [[Fifth Avenue]], though, ''Jirón de la Unión'' is not paved for cars, but almost entirely a shopping and [[pedestrian street]]; the main thoroughfares for cars and [[bus]]es are Tacna Ave. on the West side and Abancay Ave. on the East. Both are separated from Jirón de la Unión by 4 blocks. The ''[[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza de Armas]]'' (Grand Army Plaza), which is the main square, is located on block 2 of Jirón de la Unión, facing the Peruvian government palace and the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima ([[City Hall]]). It's also known as '''[[Damero de Pizarro]]''' (''Pizarro's Checkerboard'').

East of the center is the '''Barrios Altos''' (Uptown) neighborhood. Here the oldest, though least stable, buildings in Central Lima are located. Two cemeteries, El Angel and Presbítero Maestro, form the eastern border with [[El Agustino]]. Parts of the long-demolished colonial city walls can be seen here. Abutting this to the southwest is the [[Chinatown, Lima|'''Barrio chino''']] (Chinatown) neighborhood, dating from the mid-1800s.

South of the West Side is '''Santa Beatriz''' section, which contains residential buildings and the ''Parque de la Reserva''. Santa Beatriz is locally famous for containing the buildings for the state TV network [[Peruvian National Television|TNP]] (Ch. 7), and the top two private [[TV networks]], America Television (Ch. 4) and Panamericana Television (Ch. 5). Its main thoroughfare is Arequipa Avenue, a narrow boulevard lined with trees of all sizes. Santa Beatriz is also home to the city (and country)'s main [[association football|football]] [[stadium]], the [[Estadio Nacional (Lima)|Estadio Nacional]] (''National Stadium'').

West of the center is the '''Industrial Area''', an [[industry|industrial]] belt extending into neighboring Callao Region, and home to the main industries in both city and country. Most of the area is covered by large blocks containing large factories.

At its northern and southern edges, there are clusters of [[residential area]]s, particularly in the southern zone bordering Pueblo Libre, [[San Miguel District, Lima|San Miguel]] and Callao Region's [[Bellavista District]].

'''Lo Hoi-sing''' ({{zh|t=羅海星|p=Luó Hǎixīng}}; 1949 – 14 January 2010) was a [[Hong Kong]] businessman born into a communist Hong Kong family. He was famous for rescuing Chinese dissidents in [[Operation Yellowbird]] after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], for which he was arrested in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's Message: Jailing of a Hong Kong Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/world/china-s-message-jailing-of-a-hong-kong-man.html?pagewanted=1|publisher=New York Times|date=1991-04-25 | first=Sheryl | last=Wudunn | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released at the request of [[British Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in 1991.

==Biography==
Lo was born in 1949 to {{ill|Lo Fu (editor)|zh|羅孚 (作家)|lt=Lo Fu}} ({{zh|t=羅孚|labels=no}}), a communist Chinese editor of a [[Hong Kong]] newspaper.  He was raised and educated in Hong Kong and later continued his studies in the city of [[Guangzhou]], where he experienced the [[Cultural Revolution]] during the 1960s.  He later returned to Hong Kong and began working for a communist newspaper, like his father.

Lo ended his ties with the Communist Party when his father was arrested by the Chinese government. He instead began working in [[Beijing]] as the chief representative for the [[Trade Development Council]] of Hong Kong, but he resigned the post in early 1989 after seeking business opportunities in trade between Hong Kong and the PRC.

Lo was married to children's author {{ill|Chow Mat-mat|zh|周蜜蜜}} (Zhou Mimi), the daughter of the well known writer [[Huang Qingyun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2165123/pioneer-chinese-childrens-literature-huang-ching-yuen-dies-98|title=Pioneer of Chinese children’s literature Huang Ching-yuen dies at 98|last=Ng|first=Kang-chung|date=21 September 2018|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Louise Botting''' [[CBE]] (born 19 September 1939) is a British company director and former broadcaster. She was presenter of BBC Radio 4's ''[[Money Box]]'' programme between 1977 and 1992. After her broadcasting career, she became one of the first female directors of a [[FTSE-100]] company, through her appointment to the board of [[CGNU]] (formerly [[General Accident]], now [[Aviva]]). She has also held non-executive directorships of other companies such as [[Trinity Mirror]], [[London Weekend Television]] and [[Camelot Group]].

In 1974, she founded the private wealth management firm Douglas Deakin Young, serving as its managing director and then chairman until the firm was sold to [[Duncan Lawrie]] in 2005. Over the years, she has had an extensive portfolio of business interests.

==Early life and professional career==
Botting was born into a middle-class family, attending the local grammar school, Sutton Coldfield High School for Girls (now [[Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls]]) and went on to the [[London School of Economics]].

After her graduation in 1961 she joined the British merchant bank [[Kleinwort Benson]] as one of their first female analysts. Her marriage to the writer and explorer [[Douglas Botting]] led to a career break as she gave birth to her two daughters, Kate and [[Anna Botting]] (now a newsreader with [[Sky News]]). Her career in journalism started in 1970 when she started writing for the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. She started broadcasting with [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] in 1971 and continued to do this until 1981.

In 1974, she established the private wealth management firm Douglas Deakin Young, with the businessman George Douglas and James Deakin, a medical doctor. Her initial role was managing director, until her succession by Alan Warner in 1982, when she became chairman. She remained in this role until the firm was sold to [[Duncan Lawrie]] in 2005.

==''Money Box''==
In 1977, she was asked to be the founding presenter of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Money Box]]''. The aim of the programme was to make sensible personal financial advice available to ordinary people. The still ongoing programme covers a broad range of investment and tax issues, as well as covering major changes in social security. The popularity of the programme increased, attracting up to three million listeners each week. The political influence of the programme was highlighted by the fact that, at times, the Prime Minister's office often asked to know the proposed content in advance.

By 1992, Botting wished to pursue other business interests and was asked to join the board of [[London Weekend Television]]. This appointment was unpalatable to the BBC and Botting decided to resign from the programme. She was succeeded by Alison Mitchell.

==Later career==
Botting has pursued many other business interests. In addition to Douglas Deakin Young and London Weekend Television, she served as non-executive director of CGNU (formerly [[General Accident]], now [[Aviva]]) and [[Trinity Mirror]]. She still remains a director of national lottery operator [[Camelot Group]].

She also acted as a member of the Top Salaries Review Body between 1987 and 1994, and was rewarded by Prime Minister [[John Major]] for her work and for services to journalism with a [[CBE]].

Her interests have also extended to local radio, with ownership of a number of different stakes. In 1995 she chaired the consortium who were awarded the new local radio licence for Stratford-upon-Avon, launching as The Bear in 1996.

She also acted as professional pension trustee to [[Channel Four]], [[Blackwell Publishing]], [[W H Smith]] and the [[Institute of Practitioners in Advertising]]. After the sale of Douglas Deakin Young in 2005 to [[Duncan Lawrie]], she stepped down as chairman and now acts as a Consultant.

She is a patron of APT Action on Poverty (Registered Charity No. 290836).

'''Market segmentation''' is the activity of dividing a broad consumer or business [[market (economics)|market]], normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of [[consumer]]s (known as ''segments'') based on some type of shared characteristics. In dividing or segmenting markets, researchers typically look for common characteristics such as shared needs, common interests, similar lifestyles or even similar [[demographic profile]]s. The overall aim of segmentation is to identify ''high yield segments'' – that is, those segments that are likely to be the most profitable or that have growth potential – so that these can be selected for special attention (i.e. become [[target market]]s).

Many different ways to segment a market have been identified. Business-to-business (B2B) sellers might segment the market into different types of [[business]]es or [[country|countries]]. While business to consumer (B2C) sellers might segment the market into demographic segments, lifestyle segments, behavioural segments or any other meaningful segment.

[[File:STP approach.jpg|thumb|300px|The STP approach highlights the three areas of decision-making]]

Market segmentation assumes that different market segments require different marketing programs – that is, different offers, prices, promotion, distribution or some combination of marketing variables. Market segmentation is not only designed to identify the most profitable segments, but also to develop profiles of key segments in order to better understand their needs and purchase motivations. Insights from segmentation analysis are subsequently used to support marketing strategy development and planning. Many marketers use the S-T-P approach; '''S'''egmentation→ '''T'''argeting → [[Positioning (marketing)|'''P'''ositioning]] to provide the framework for marketing planning objectives. That is, a market is segmented, one or more segments are selected for targeting, and products or services are positioned in a way that resonates with the selected target market or markets.

== Definition and brief explanation ==

Market segmentation is the process of dividing up mass markets into groups with similar needs and wants.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Cassidy, R., ''Marketing Principles, '' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed, Cengage, 2018, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for market segmentation is that in order to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance, firms should: "(1) identify segments of industry demand, (2) target specific segments of demand, and (3) develop specific 'marketing mixes' for each targeted market segment. "&lt;ref&gt;Madhavaram, S., &amp; Hunt, S. D., "The Service-dominant Logic and a Hierarchy of Operant Resources: Developing Masterful Operant Resources and Implications for Marketing Strategy, " ''Journal Of The Academy Of Marketing Science, '' Vol. 36, No. 1, 2008, pp 67-82.&lt;/ref&gt; From an economic perspective, segmentation is built on the assumption that heterogeneity in demand allows for demand to be disaggregated into segments with distinct demand functions.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Peter R.; Ginter, James L., "Market Segmentation, Product Differentiation, and Marketing Strategy, " ''Journal of Marketing, '' Vol. 51, No. 2, 1987, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
[[File:1921 Model T Ford.jpg|thumb|The Model-T Ford (1921) is an early example of a mass marketing (undifferentiated segmentation) approach. Initially it was produced only in black.]]
The business historian, [[Richard S. Tedlow]], identifies four stages in the evolution of market segmentation:&lt;ref&gt;In his oft-cited work, ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp. 4–12, Richard Tedlow outlines first three stages: fragmentation, unification and segmentation. In a subsequent work, published three years later, Tedlow and his co-author thought that they had seen evidence of a new trend and added a fourth era, termed Hyper-segmentation (post 1980s); See Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fragmentation (pre-1880s)''': The economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis
* '''Unification or [[mass marketing]] (1880s–1920s)''': As transportation systems improved, the economy became unified. Standardised, branded goods were distributed at a national level. Manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to penetrating markets in the early stages of a product's lifecycle. e.g. the Model T Ford
* '''Segmentation (1920s–1980s)''': As market size increased, manufacturers were able to produce different models pitched at different quality points to meet the needs of various demographic and [[psychographic]] market segments. This is the era of market differentiation based on demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors.
* '''Hyper-segmentation (post-1980s)''': a shift towards the definition of ever more narrow market segments. Technological advancements, especially in the area of digital communications, allow marketers to communicate with individual consumers or very small groups. This is sometimes known as ''one-to-one'' marketing.
[[File:1931 Ford Model A Deluxe Coupe (2).jpg|thumb|By the 1930s, Ford was producing Deluxe models in a range of colours such as this Ford Deluxe Coupe (1931)]]
The practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers thought about it at a theoretical level.&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, R., "Segmentation in Practice: An Overview of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," in Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, M. E., "Trade and Weighing Systems in the Southern Aegean from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age: How Changing Circuits Influenced Glocal Measures," in Molloy, B. (ed.), ''Of Odysseys and Oddities: Scales and Modes of Interaction Between Prehistoric Aegean Societies and their Neighbours,'' [Sheffield Studies in Aegean Archaeology], Oxford, Oxbow, (E-Book), 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Other evidence suggests that the practice of modern market segmentation was developed incrementally from the 16th century onwards. Retailers, operating outside the major metropolitan cities, could not afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively, yet retailers needed to find ways to separate the wealthier clientele from the "riff raff". One simple technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century, was to invite favored customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth-century English entrepreneurs, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls to which only the upper classes were invited while Wedgewood used a team of itinerant salesmen to sell wares to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb, J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of early marketing segmentation has also been noted elsewhere in Europe. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, R.A., "Segmentation Strategies and Practices in the 19th-Century German Book Trade: A Case Study in the Development of a Major Marketing Technique", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N. Sheth and Chin Tiong Tan (eds), Singapore, Association for Consumer Research, pp 135-139 &lt;/ref&gt; From the 1880s, German toy manufacturers were producing models of [[tin toys]] for specific geographic markets; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America. &lt;ref&gt;Pressland, David, ''Book of Penny Toys,'' Pei International, 1991; Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Such activities suggest that basic forms of market segmentation have been practised since the 17th century and possibly earlier.

Contemporary market segmentation emerged in the first decades of the twentieth century as marketers responded to two pressing issues. Demographic and purchasing data were available for groups but rarely for individuals and secondly, advertising and distribution channels were available for groups, but rarely for single consumers. Between 1902 and 1910, George B Waldron, working at Mahin's Advertising Agency in the United States used tax registers, city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated vs illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations etc. in a very early example of simple market segmentation.&lt;ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66"&gt;Jones, G.D.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 14, No. 5, 1950, pp. 733–736 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Paul Cherington developed the 'ABCD' household typology; the first socio-demographic segmentation tool.&lt;ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 14, no. 5, 1950, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, market researchers such as [[Ernest Dichter]] recognised that demographics alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviours and began exploring the use of lifestyles, attitudes, values, beliefs and culture to segment markets. &lt;ref&gt;Wilson B. S.  and Levy, J., "A History of the Concept of Branding: Practice and Theory", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 347-368; DOI: 10.1108/17557501211252934&lt;/ref&gt; With access to group level data only, brand marketers approached the task from a tactical viewpoint. Thus, segmentation was essentially a brand-driven process.

Wendell R. Smith is generally credited with being the first to introduce the concept of market segmentation into the marketing literature in 1956 with the publication of his article, "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Cano, C., "The Recent Evolution of Market Segmentation Concepts and Thoughts Primarily by Marketing Academics," in E. Shaw (ed) ''The Romance of Marketing History,'' Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM), Boca Raton, FL, AHRIM, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's article makes it clear that he had observed "many examples of segmentation" emerging and to a certain extent saw this as a "natural force" in the market that would "not be denied."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.R., "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1 , 1956, pp. 3–8 and reprinted in ''Marketing Management,'' vol. 4, no. 3, 1995, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; As Schwarzkopf points out, Smith was codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in advertising and brand management since at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930" ''CGR Working Paper,'' Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Until relatively recently, most segmentation approaches have retained a tactical perspective in that they address immediate short-term decisions; such as describing the current “market served” and are concerned with informing marketing mix decisions. However, with the advent of digital communications and mass data storage, it has been possible for marketers to conceive of segmenting at the level of the individual consumer. Extensive data is now available to support segmentation at very narrow groups or even for the single customer, allowing marketers to devise a customised offer with an individual price which can be disseminated via real-time communications.&lt;ref&gt;Kara, A and Kaynak, E., "Markets of a Single Customer: Exploiting Conceptual Developments in Market Segmentation", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 31, no. 11/12, 1997, pp. 873–895, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03090569710190587&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the fragmentation of markets has rendered traditional approaches to market segmentation less useful.&lt;ref&gt;Firat, A.F. and Shultz, C.J., "From Segmentation to Fragmentation: Markets and Marketing Strategy in the Postmodern Era," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 31 no. 3/4, 1997, pp 183-207&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

The limitations of conventional segmentation have been well documented in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Hoek, J., Gendall, P. and Esslemont, D., Market segmentation: A search for the Holy Grail?, ''Journal of Marketing Practice Applied Marketing Science,'' Vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 25–34, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial criticisms include:

* That it is no better than mass marketing at building brands&lt;ref&gt;Addison, T. and O'Donohue, M., "Understanding the Customer’s Relationship With a Brand: The Role of Market Segmentation in Building Stronger Brands," Market Research Society Conference, London, 2001, Online: http://www.warc.com/fulltext/MRS/49705.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* That in competitive markets, segments rarely exhibit major differences in the way they use brands&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, R. and Ehrenberg, A., "What’s in a brand?" ''Research'', April, 2000, pp 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;
* That it fails to identify sufficiently narrow clusters&lt;ref&gt;Bardakci, A. and Whitelock, L., "Mass-customisation in Marketing: The Consumer Perspective," ''Journal of Consumer Marketing' vol. 20, no.5, 2003, pp. 463–479.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geographic/demographic segmentation is overly descriptive and lacks sufficient insights into the motivations necessary to drive communications strategy&lt;ref&gt;Smit, E. G. and Niejens, P. C., 2000. "Segmentation Based on Affinity for Advertising," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 40, no. 4, 2000, pp. 35–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulties with market dynamics, notably the instability of segments over time&lt;ref&gt;Albaum, G. and Hawkins, D. I., "Geographic Mobility and Demographic and Socioeconomic Market Segmentation," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' vol. 11, no. 2. 1983, pp. 97–114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blocker, C. P. and Flint, D. J., 2007. "Customer Segments as Moving Targets: Integrating Customer Value Dynamism into Segment Instability Logic," ''Industrial Market Management,'' vol. 36, no. 6., 2007, pp. 810–822.&lt;/ref&gt; and structural change which leads to segment creep and membership migration as individuals move from one segment to another&lt;ref&gt;Board, T. "Ten Lessons Learned from Cybersegmentation," ''Technology &amp; Communications practice for IIR – The Market Research Event'' IPSOS Insight. 2004 [On-line] http://www.ipsosinsight.com/pdf/IpsosInsight_PD_TenTips.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Market segmentation has many critics. But in spite of its limitations, market segmentation remains one of the enduring concepts in marketing and continues to be widely used in practice. One American study, for example, suggested that almost 60 percent of senior executives had used market segmentation in the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;Yankelovich, D., Meer, D. "Rediscovering Market Segmentation", ''Harvard Business Review'' vol. 84. no 2, 2006, pp. 122–13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market segmentation strategy ==
{{See also|Niche market|Porter's generic strategies}}

A key consideration for marketers is whether to segment or not to segment. Depending on company philosophy, resources, product type or market characteristics, a business may develop an [[Mass marketing|undifferentiated approach]] or ''differentiated approach''. In an undifferentiated approach, the marketer ignores segmentation and develops a product that meets the needs of the largest number of buyers.&lt;ref name="business dict undifferentiated"&gt;''Business Dictionary '' Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/undifferentiated-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a differentiated approach the firm targets one or more market segments, and develops separate offers for each segment.&lt;ref name="business dict undifferentiated" /&gt;

[[File:Sal Maldon.JPG|thumb|Even simple products like salt, which might be considered as commodities, are highly differentiated in practice.]]

In consumer marketing, it is difficult to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as [[salt]] and [[sugar]], which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodised salt, salt substitutes and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including ''smart sugar'' which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed to meet the needs of specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate, and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments – refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.

A number of factors are likely to affect a company's segmentation strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Insider, Market Targeting: Target Segments Effectively and Efficiently, https://marketing-insider.eu/marketing-explained/part-i-defining-marketing-and-the-marketing-process/market-targeting/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Company resources: When resources are restricted, a concentrated strategy may be more effective.
* Product variability: For highly uniform products (such as sugar or steel) an undifferentiated marketing may be more appropriate. For products that can be differentiated, (such as cars) then either a differentiated or concentrated approach is indicated.
* Product life cycle: For new products, one version may be used at the launch stage, but this may be expanded to a more segmented approach over time. As more competitors enter the market, it may be necessary to differentiate.
* Market characteristics: When all buyers have similar tastes or are unwilling to pay a premium for different quality, then undifferentiated marketing is indicated.
* Competitive activity: When competitors apply differentiated or concentrated market segmentation, using undifferentiated marketing may prove to be fatal. A company should consider whether it can use a different market segmentation approach.

== Segmentation, targeting, positioning ==

The process of segmenting the market is deceptively simple. Seven basic steps describe the entire process including segmentation, targeting, and positioning. In practice, however, the task can be very laborious since it involves poring over voluminous data, and requires a great deal of skill in analysis, interpretation and some judgment. Although a great deal of analysis needs to be undertaken, and many decisions need to be made, marketers tend to use the so-called [[Segmentation, targeting and positioning|S-T-P process]], that is '''S'''egmentation→ '''T'''argeting → '''P'''ositioning, as a broad framework for simplifying the process.&lt;ref&gt;Moutinho, L., "Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning and Strategic Marketing," Chapter 5 in Strategic Management in Tourism, Moutinho, L. (ed), CAB International, 2000, pp. 121–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Segmentation comprises identifying the market to be segmented; identification, selection, and application of bases to be used in that segmentation; and development of profiles. Targeting comprises an evaluation of each segment's attractiveness and selection of the segments to be targeted. Positioning comprises the identification of optimal position and development of the marketing program.

== Identifying the market to be segmented ==
{{see also|Serviceable available market}}

The market for a given product or service known as the ''market potential'' or the ''[[total addressable market]] (TAM).'' Given that this is the market to be segmented, the market analyst should begin by identifying the size of the potential market. For existing products and services, estimating the size and value of the market potential is relatively straightforward. However, estimating the market potential can be very challenging when a product or service is totally new to the market and no historical data on which to base forecasts exists.

A basic approach is to first assess the size of the broad population, then estimate the percentage likely to use the product or service and finally to estimate the revenue potential.

[[File:Tv-penetration-us-households.jpg|thumb|300px|To estimate market size, a marketer might evaluate the adoption and growth rates of comparable technologies (historical analogy method).]]

Another approach is to use historical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser,B. and Vagianos,L. ''Computer Communications and the Mass Market in Canada'', Institute for Research on Public Policy, 1985, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the manufacturer of HDTV might assume that the number of consumers willing to adopt high definition TV will be similar to the adoption rate for Color TV. To support this type of analysis, data for household penetration of TV, Radio, PCs, and other communications technologies is readily available from government statistics departments. Finding useful analogies can be challenging because every market is unique. However, analogous product adoption and growth rates can provide the analyst with benchmark estimates, and can be used to cross-validate other methods that might be used to forecast sales or market size.

A more robust technique for estimating the market potential is known as the [[Bass diffusion model]], the equation for which follows:&lt;ref&gt;Mauboussin, M.J. and Callahan, D., ''Total Addressable Market: Methods to Estimate a Company's Potential Sales,'' [Occasional Paper], Credit-Suisse – Global Financial Strategies, 1 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

: N(''t'') – N(''t''−1) = [''p'' + ''q''N(''t''−1)/''m''] × [''m'' – N(''t''−1)]

Where:

* N(''t'')= the number of adopters in the current time period, (''t'')
* N(''t''−1)= the number of adopters in the previous time period, (''t''-1)
* ''p'' = the coefficient of innovation
* ''q'' = the coefficient of imitation (the social contagion influence)
* ''m'' = an estimate of the number of eventual adopters

The major challenge with the Bass model is estimating the parameters for ''p'' and ''q''. However, the Bass model has been so widely used in empirical studies that the values of ''p'' and ''q'' for more than 50 consumer and industrial categories have been determined and are widely published in tables.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Lilien,G., Rangaswamy, A. and Van den Bulte, C., “Diffusion Models: Managerial Applications and Software,” ''ISBM Report 7,'' May 20, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The average value for ''p'' is 0.037 and for ''q'' is 0.327.

== Bases for segmenting consumer markets ==

[[File:Bases for segmentation.png|thumb|300px|Major bases used for segmenting a market]]

A major step in the segmentation process is the selection of a suitable base. In this step, marketers are looking for a means of achieving internal homogeneity (similarity within the segments), and external heterogeneity (differences between segments).&lt;ref&gt;Sarin, S., ''Market Segmentation and Targeting'', Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they are searching for a process that minimises differences between members of a segment and maximises differences between each segment. In addition, the segmentation approach must yield segments that are meaningful for the specific marketing problem or situation. For example, a person's hair color may be a relevant base for a shampoo manufacturer, but it would not be relevant for a seller of financial services. Selecting the right base requires a good deal of thought and a basic understanding of the market to be segmented.

In reality, marketers can segment the market using any base or variable provided that it is identifiable, substantial, responsive, actionable and stable.&lt;ref&gt;Gavett, G., "What You Need to Know About Segmentation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Online: July 09, 2014 https://hbr.org/2014/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-segmentation&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Identifiability'' refers to the extent to which managers can identify or recognise distinct groups within the marketplace
* ''Substantiality'' refers to the extent to which a segment or group of customers represents a sufficient size to be profitable. This could mean sufficiently large in number of people or in purchasing power
* ''Accessibility'' refers to the extent to which marketers can reach the targeted segments with promotional or distribution efforts
* ''Responsiveness'' refers to the extent to which consumers in a defined segment will respond to marketing offers targeted at them
* ''Actionable'' – segments are said to be actionable when they provide guidance for marketing decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel,M. and Kamakura, W.A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, pp 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, although dress size is not a standard base for segmenting a market, some fashion houses have successfully segmented the market using women's dress size as a variable.&lt;ref&gt;In the early 1980s, Australian fashion designer, [[Maggie Tabberer|Maggie T]], was the recipient of a Hoover Award for a segmentation study which showed that women with dress size 16+ underspent on clothes because they were unable to find suitable garments. This insight led to the establishment of 'plus-sized' fashion outlets. Case study reported in ''Australian Marketing Projects: the Hoover Award for Marketing,'' West Ryde, Australia, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most common bases for segmenting consumer markets include: geographics, demographics, psychographics, and behaviour. Marketers normally select a single base for the segmentation analysis, although, some bases can be combined into a single segmentation with care. For example, geographics and demographics are often combined, but other bases are rarely combined. Given that psychographics includes demographic variables such as age, gender, and income as well as attitudinal and behavioural variables, it makes little logical sense to combine psychographics with demographics or other bases. Any attempt to use combined bases needs careful consideration and a logical foundation.

The following sections provide a detailed description of the most common forms of consumer market segmentation.

=== Geographic segmentation ===

Geographic segmentation divides markets according to geographic criteria. In practice, markets can be segmented as broadly as continents and as narrowly as neighborhoods or postal codes.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel,M. and Kamakura, W.A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, pp 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Typical geographic variables include:

* '''Country''' e.g. Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, UK, US
* '''Region''' e.g. North, North-west, Mid-west, South, Central
* '''Population density''': e.g. central business district (CBD), urban, suburban, rural, regional
* '''City or town size''': e.g. under 1,000; 1,000–5,000; 5,000–10,000 ... 1,000,000–3,000,000 and over 3,000,000
* '''Climatic zone''': e.g. Mediterranean, Temperate, Sub-Tropical, Tropical, Polar

The geo-cluster approach (also called ''[[geodemographic segmentation]]'') combines demographic data with geographic data to create richer, more detailed profiles.&lt;ref&gt;'What is geographic segmentation' Kotler, Philip, and Kevin Lane Keller. ''Marketing Management''. Prentice Hall, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-13-145757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geo-cluster approaches are a consumer classification system designed market segmentation and consumer profiling purposes. They classify residential regions or postcodes on the basis of census and lifestyle characteristics obtained from a wide range of sources. This allows the segmentation of a population into smaller groups defined by individual characteristics such as demographic, socio-economic or other shared socio-demographic characteristics.

Geographic segmentation may be considered the first step in international marketing, where marketers must decide whether to adapt their existing products and marketing programs for the unique needs of distinct geographic markets. Tourism Marketing Boards often segment international visitors based on their country of origin.

A number of proprietary geo-demographic packages are available for commercial use. Geographic segmentation is widely used in direct marketing campaigns to identify areas which are potential candidates for personal selling, letter-box distribution or direct mail. Geo-cluster segmentation is widely used by Governments and public sector departments such as urban planning, health authorities, police, criminal justice departments, telecommunications and public utility organisations such as water boards.&lt;ref&gt;Doos, L. Uttley, J. and Onyia, I., "Mosaic segmentation, COPD and CHF multimorbidity and hospital admission costs: a clinical linkage study," ''Journal of Public Health,'' Vo. 36, no. 2, 2014, pp. 317–324&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographic segmentation ===
{{further|Demographic targeting}}

Segmentation according to demography is based on consumer- demographic variables such as age, income, family size, socio-economic status, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid |first1=Robert D. |last2=Bojanic |first2=David C. |title=Hospitality Marketing Management |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wZUFreNHOWsC |accessdate=2013-06-08 |edition=Fifth |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-470-08858-6 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Demographic segmentation assumes that consumers with similar demographic profiles will exhibit similar purchasing patterns, motivations, interests and lifestyles and that these characteristics will translate into similar product/brand preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Baker,M., ''The Marketing Book,'' 5th ed, Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2003, p.709&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, demographic segmentation can potentially employ any variable that is used by the nation's census collectors. Typical demographic variables and their descriptors are as follows:

* '''Age''': e.g. Under 5, 5–8 years, 9–12 years, 13–17 years, 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60+&lt;ref&gt;Sarin, S., ''Market Segmentation and Targeting,'' Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gender''': Male, Female&lt;ref&gt;Sara C. Parks PhD &amp; Frederick J. Demicco, "Age- and Gender-Based Market Segmentation: A Structural Understanding,"''International Journal of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Administration,'' Vol. 3, No. 1, 2002, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J149v03n01_01&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Occupation''': Professional, self-employed, semi-professional, clerical/ admin, sales, trades, mining, primary producer, student, home duties, unemployed, retired&lt;ref&gt;Tynan, A.N and Drayton, J., "Market segmentation," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 2, No. 3, 1987, DOI:https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.1987.9964020&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Socio-economic''': A, B, C, D, E, or I, II, III, IV or V (normally divided into quintiles)&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, R., “The Continuing Significance of Social Class to Marketing.” ''Journal of Consumer Research,'' Vol. 10, 1983, pp 265-280&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Marital Status''': Single, married, divorced, widowed
* '''Family Life-stage''': Young single; Young married with no children; Young family with children under 5 years; Older married with children; Older married with no children living at home, Older living alone&lt;ref&gt;Gilly, M.C. and Enis, B.M., "Recycling the Family Life Cycle: a Proposal For Redefinition", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 09, Andrew Mitchell (ed.), Ann Abor, MI: Association for Consumer Research, pp 271-276, Direct URL:http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6007/volumes/v09/NA-09&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Family size/ number of dependants''': 0, 1–2, 3–4, 5+
* '''Income''': Under $10,000; 10,000–20,000; 20,001–30,000; 30,001–40,000, 40,001–50,000 etc.
* '''Educational attainment''': Primary school; Some secondary, Completed secondary, Some university, Degree; Post graduate or higher degree
* '''Home ownership''': Renting, Own home with mortgage, Home owned outright
* '''Ethnicity''': Asian, African, Aboriginal, Polynesian, Melanesian, Latin-American, African-American, American Indian etc.
* '''Religion''': Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Other

In practice, most demographic segmentation utilises a combination of demographic variables.

[[File:Demographic segmentation.jpg|thumb|300px|Visualisation of two approaches to demographic segmentation using one and two variables. On the left, a single variable (age) is used. On the right, two variables (income and occupation) are used to form the segments.]]

The use of multiple segmentation variables normally requires analysis of databases using sophisticated statistical techniques such as cluster analysis or principal components analysis. It should be noted that these types of analysis require very large sample sizes. However, data-collection is expensive for individual firms. For this reason, many companies purchase data from commercial market research firms, many of whom develop proprietary software to interrogate the data.

The labels applied to some of the more popular demographic segments began to enter the popular lexicon in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Boushey, H., ''Finding Time,'' Boushey, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtwright, D.T., ''No Right Turn,'' Harvard University Press, 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dension, D. and Hogg, R., (eds), ''A History of the English Language,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; These include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Thorne, T., ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang,'' 4th ed, London, Bloomsbury, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burridge, K., ''Blooming English: Observations on the Roots, Cultivation and Hybrids of the English Language,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

:: '''[[DINK (acronym)|DINK]]''': Double (or dual) Income, No Kids, describes one member of a couple with above-average household income and no dependent children, tend to exhibit discretionary expenditure on luxury goods and entertainment and dining out
:: '''GLAM''': Greying, Leisured and Moneyed. Retired older persons, asset rich and high income. Tend to exhibit higher spending on recreation, travel, and entertainment

=== Psychographic segmentation ===
{{Main|Psychographic segmentation}}

[[Psychographic]] segmentation, which is sometimes called psychometric or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] segmentation, is measured by studying the activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) of customers. It considers how people spend their leisure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/mmmarketsegmentation.htm |title=Market Segmentation and Targeting |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=2011 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801023550/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/mmmarketsegmentation.htm |archivedate=1 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which external influences they are most responsive to and influenced by. Psychographics is a very widely used basis for segmentation, because it enables marketers to identify tightly defined market segments and better understand consumer motivations for product or brand choice.

While many of these proprietary psychographic segmentation analyses are well-known, the majority of studies based on psychographics are custom designed. That is, the segments are developed for individual products at a specific time. One common thread among psychographic segmentation studies is that they use quirky names to describe the segments.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, pp 10-15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioural segmentation ===

Behavioural segmentation divides consumers into groups according to their observed behaviours. Many marketers believe that behavioural variables are superior to demographics and geographics for building market segments&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kotler and Gary Armstrong, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Pearson, 2014; 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and some analysts have suggested that behavioural segmentation is killing off demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, D., "Is behavioural data killing off demographics?" ''Marketing Week,''4 September 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; Typical behavioural variables and their descriptors include:&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., ''Marketing Management: Planning, Analysis, Implementation and Control,'' 9th ed., Upper Saddle River, Pearson, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Purchase/Usage Occasion''': e.g. regular occasion, special occasion, festive occasion, gift-giving
* '''Benefit-Sought''': e.g. economy, quality, service level, convenience, access
* '''User Status''': e.g. First-time user, Regular user, Non-user
* '''Usage Rate/Purchase Frequency''': e.g. Light user, heavy user, moderate user
* '''Loyalty Status''': e.g. Loyal, switcher, non-loyal, lapsed
* '''Buyer Readiness''': e.g. Unaware, aware, intention to buy
* '''Attitude to Product or Service''': e.g. Enthusiast, Indifferent, Hostile; Price Conscious, Quality Conscious
* '''Adopter Status''': e.g. Early adopter, late adopter, laggard

Note that these descriptors are merely commonly used examples. Marketers customise the variable and descriptors for both local conditions and for specific applications. For example, in the health industry, planners often segment broad markets according to 'health consciousness' and identify low, moderate and highly health conscious segments. This is an applied example of behavioural segmentation, using attitude to product or service as a key descriptor or variable which has been customised for the specific application.

==== Purchase/usage occasion ====

Purchase or usage occasion segmentation focuses on analyzing occasions when consumers might purchase or consume a product. This approach customer-level and occasion-level segmentation models and provides an understanding of the individual customers’ needs, behaviour and value under different occasions of usage and time. Unlike traditional segmentation models, this approach assigns more than one segment to each unique customer, depending on the current circumstances they are under.

==== Benefit-sought ====
Benefit segmentation (sometimes called ''needs-based segmentation'') was developed by Grey Advertising in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, K.J. and Roberts, M.L., "Towards an Optimal Market Target: A Strategy for Market Segmentation", ''Journal of Consumer Marketing'', vol. 1, no. 1, pp 64-73&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits-sought by purchasers enables the market to be divided into segments with distinct needs, perceived value, benefits sought or advantage that accrues from the purchase of a product or service. Marketers using benefit segmentation might develop products with different quality levels, performance, customer service, special features or any other meaningful benefit and pitch different products at each of the segments identified. Benefit segmentation is one of the more commonly used approaches to segmentation and is widely used in many consumer markets including motor vehicles, fashion and clothing, furniture, consumer electronics, and holiday-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, R., "Benefit Segmentation: A potentially useful technique of segmenting and targeting older consumers," ''International Journal of Market Research,'' Vol. 45, No. 3, 2003 &lt;/ref&gt;

Loker and Purdue, for example, used benefit segmentation to segment the pleasure holiday travel market. The segments identified in this study were the naturalists, pure excitement seekers, escapists.&lt;ref&gt;Loker, L.E. and Perdue, R.R., "A Benefit–Based Segmentation," ''Journal of Travel Research,'' Vol. 31, No. 1, 1992, pp. 30–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attitudinal segments ====

Attitudinal segmentation provides insight into the mindset of customers, especially the attitudes and beliefs that drive consumer decision-making and behaviour. An example of attitudinal segmentation comes from the UK's Department of Environment which segmented the British population into six segments, based on attitudes that drive behaviour relating to environmental protection:&lt;ref&gt;Simkin, L., "Segmentation," in Baker, M.J. and Hart, S., ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016, pp. 271–294&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Greens''': Driven by the belief that protecting the environment is critical; try to conserve whenever they can
* '''Conscious with a conscience''': Aspire to be ''green''; primarily concerned with wastage; lack awareness of other behaviours associated with broader environmental issues such as climate change
* '''Currently constrained''': Aspire to be ''green'' but feel they cannot afford to purchase organic products; pragmatic realists
* ''' Basic contributors''': Sceptical about the need for behaviour change; aspire to conform to social norms; lack awareness of social and environmental issues
* '''Long-term resistance''': Have serious life priorities that take precedence before a behavioural change is a consideration; their everyday behaviours often have a low impact on the environment, but for other reasons than conservation
* '''Disinterested''': View ''greenies'' as an eccentric minority; exhibit no interest in changing their behaviour; may be aware of climate change but have not internalised it to the extent that it enters their decision-making process.

=== Other types of consumer segmentation ===

In addition to geographics, demographics, psychographics and behavioural bases, marketers occasionally turn to other means of segmenting the market, or to develop segment profiles.

==== Generational segments ====

A generation is defined as "a cohort of people born within a similar span of time (15 years at the upper end) who share a comparable age and life stage and who were shaped by a particular span of time (events, trends, and developments)."&lt;ref&gt;McCrindle, M., ''Generations Defined'' [Booklet] n.d. circa 2010 Online: http://mccrindle.com.au/BlogRetrieve.aspx?PostID=146968&amp;A=SearchResult&amp;SearchID=9599835&amp;ObjectID=146968&amp;ObjectType=55&lt;/ref&gt; Generational segmentation refers to the process of dividing and analyzing a population into cohorts based on their birth date. Generational segmentation assumes that people's values and attitudes are shaped by the key events that occurred during their lives and that these attitudes translate into product and brand preferences.

Demographers, studying population change, disagree about precise dates for each generation.&lt;ref&gt;Cran, C., ''The Art of Change Leadership: Driving Transformation In a Fast-Paced World,'' Wiley, Hoboken, N.J. 2016, pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt; Dating is normally achieved by identifying population peaks or troughs, which can occur at different times in each country. For example, in Australia the post-war population boom peaked in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Salt, B., '' The Big Shift'' , South Yarra, Vic.: Hardie Grant Books, 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-74066-188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the peak occurred somewhat later in the USA and Europe,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, ''American Fact Finder: Age Groups and Sex'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with most estimates converging on 1964. Accordingly, Australian Boomers are normally defined as those born between 1945–1960; while American and European Boomers are normally defined as those born between 1945–64. Thus, the generational segments and their dates discussed here must be taken as approximations only.

The primary generational segments identified by marketers are:&lt;ref&gt;McCrindle Research, ''Seriously Cool – Marketing &amp; Communicating with Diverse Generations'', Norwest Business Park, Australia, n.d. c. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* Builders: born 1920 to 1945
* [[Baby boomers]]: born about 1945–1965
* [[Generation X]]: born about 1966–1976
* Generation Y: also known as [[Millennials]]; born about 1977–1994
* [[Generation Z]]: also known as Centennials; born 1995–2015

==== Cultural segmentation ====

Cultural segmentation is used to classify markets according to cultural origin. Culture is a major dimension of consumer behaviour and can be used to enhance customer insight and as a component of predictive models. Cultural segmentation enables appropriate communications to be crafted to particular cultural communities. Cultural segmentation can be applied to existing customer data to measure market penetration in key cultural segments by product, brand, channel as well as traditional measures of recency, frequency, and monetary value. These benchmarks form an important evidence-base to guide strategic direction and tactical campaign activity, allowing engagement trends to be monitored over time.&lt;ref&gt;Ellson, T., ''Culture and Positioning as Determinants of Strategy: Personality and the Business Organization'', Springer,  2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural segmentation can be combined with other bases, especially geographics so that segments are mapped according to state, region, suburb, and neighborhood. This provides a geographical market view of population proportions and may be of benefit in selecting appropriately located premises, determining territory boundaries and local marketing activities.

Census data is a valuable source of cultural data but cannot meaningfully be applied to individuals. Name analysis ([[onomastics]]) is the most reliable and efficient means of describing the cultural origin of individuals. The accuracy of using name analysis as a surrogate for cultural background in Australia is 80–85%, after allowing for female name changes due to marriage, social or political reasons or colonial influence. The extent of name data coverage means a user will code a minimum of 99 percent of individuals with their most likely ancestral origin.

==== Online customer segmentation ====

Online market segmentation is similar to the traditional approaches in that the segments should be identifiable, substantial, accessible, stable, differentiable and actionable.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Gavett, July 09/2014, What You Need to Know About Segmentation, Harvard Business Review, accessed online 3/04/2017: [https://hbr.org/2014/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-segmentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Customer data stored in online data management systems such as a [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] or [[Data management platform|DMP]] enables the analysis and segmentation of consumers across a diverse set of attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Management Tools - Customer Relationship Management |url= http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-customer-relationship-management.aspx |website=www.bain.com |accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forsyth et al., in an article 'Internet research' grouped current active online consumers into six groups: Simplifiers, Surfers, Bargainers, Connectors, Routiners, and Sportsters. The segments differ regarding four customers' behaviours, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, John E.; Lavoie, Johanne; McGuire, Tim. Segmenting the e-market. McKinsey Quarterly. 2000, Issue 4, p14-18. 5p.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The amount of time they actively spend online,
* The number of pages and sites they access,
* The time they spend actively viewing each page,
* And the kinds of sites they visit.

For example, ''Simplifiers'' make over 50 percent of all online transactions. Their main characteristic is that they need easy (one-click) access to information and products as well as easy and quickly available service regarding products. Amazon.com is a good example of a company who created an online environment for Simplifiers. They also 'dislike unsolicited e-mail, uninviting chat rooms, pop-up windows intended to encourage impulse buys, and other features that complicate their on- and off-line experience'. Surfers like to spend a lot of time online, thus companies must have a variety of products to offer and constant update, ''Bargainers'' are looking for the best price, Connectors like to relate to others, ''Routiners'' want content and ''Sportsters'' like sport and entertainment sites.

Another major decision in developing the segmentation strategy is the selection of market segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as ''[[target market]]s''). The marketer faces a number of important decisions:

* What criteria should be used to evaluate markets?
* How many markets to enter (one, two or more)?
* Which market segments are the most valuable?

When a marketer enters more than one market, the segments are often labeled the ''primary target market'', ''secondary target market.'' The primary market is the target market selected as the main focus of marketing activities. The secondary target market is likely to be a segment that is not as large as the primary market, but has growth potential. Alternatively, the secondary target group might consist of a small number of purchasers that account for a relatively high proportion of sales volume perhaps due to purchase value or purchase frequency.

In terms of evaluating markets, three core considerations are essential:&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Insider, "Evaluating Market Segments", Online: http://targetmarketsegmentation.com/target-market/secondary-target-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Segment size and growth
* Segment structural attractiveness
* Company objectives and resources.

=== Criteria for evaluating segment attractiveness ===

There are no formulas for evaluating the attractiveness of market segments and a good deal of judgment must be exercised.&lt;ref&gt;Applbaum, K., The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning, Routledge, 2004, p. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of considerations can be used to assist in evaluating market segments for overall attractiveness. The following lists a series of questions that can be asked.

==== Segment size and growth ====

* How large is the market?
* Is the market segment substantial enough to be profitable? (Segment size can be measured in number of customers, but superior measures are likely to include sales value or volume)
* Is the market segment growing or contracting?
* What are the indications that growth will be sustained in the long term? Is any observed growth sustainable?
* Is the segment stable over time? (Segment must have sufficient time to reach desired performance level)

==== Segment structural attractiveness ====

* To what extent are competitors targeting this market segment?
* Do buyers have bargaining power in the market?
* Are substitute products available?
* Can we carve out a viable position to differentiate from any competitors?
* How responsive are members of the market segment to the marketing program?
* Is this market segment reachable and accessible? (i.e., with respect to distribution and promotion)

==== Company objectives and resources ====

* Is this market segment aligned with our company's operating philosophy?
* Do we have the resources necessary to enter this market segment?
* Do we have prior experience with this market segment or similar market segments?
* Do we have the skills and/or know-how to enter this market segment successfully?

== Developing the marketing program and positioning strategy ==
{{See also |Marketing mix|Positioning (marketing)|Perceptual mapping}}

[[File:Circle-spoke-Diagram-Target-Market.png|thumb|The marketing program is designed with the needs of the target market in mind]]

When the segments have been determined and separate offers developed for each of the core segments, the marketer's next task is to design a marketing program (also known as the marketing mix) that will resonate with the target market or markets. Developing the marketing program requires a deep knowledge of key market segment's purchasing habits, their preferred retail outlet, their media habits and their price sensitivity. The marketing program for each brand or product should be based on the understanding of the target market (or target markets) revealed in the market profile.

Positioning is the final step in the S-T-P planning approach; Segmentation→ Targeting → Positioning; a core framework for developing marketing plans and setting objectives. Positioning refers to decisions about how to present the offer in a way that resonates with the target market. During the research and analysis that forms the central part of segmentation and targeting, the marketer will have gained insights into what motivates consumers to purchase a product or brand. These insights will form part of the positioning strategy.

According to advertising guru, David Ogilvy, "Positioning is the act of designing the company’s offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of the target market. The goal is to locate the brand in the minds of consumers to maximise the potential benefit to the firm. A good brand positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying the brand’s essence, what goals it helps the consumer achieve, and how it does so in a unique way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogilvy |first=David |authorlink1=David Ogilvy (businessman) |title=Ogilvy on advertising |year=1985 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=9780394729039 |edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PerceptualMap1.png|thumb|300px|Perceptual map of the U.S. motor vehicle category]]

The technique known as perceptual mapping is often used to understand consumers' mental representations of brands within a given category. Traditionally two variables (often, but not necessarily, price and quality) are used to construct the map. A sample of people in the target market are asked to explain where they would place various brands in terms of the selected variables. Results are averaged across all respondents, and results are plotted on a graph, as illustrated in the figure. The final map indicates how the ''average'' member of the population views the brand that makes up a category and how each of the brands relates to other brands within the same category. While perceptual maps with two dimensions are common, multi-dimensional maps are also used.

There are a number of different approaches to positioning:&lt;ref&gt;Based on Belch, G., Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt;

# Against a competitor
# Within a category
# According to product benefit
# According to product attribute
# For usage occasion
# Along price lines e.g. a luxury brand or premium brand
# For a user
# Cultural symbols e.g. Australia's Easter Bilby (as a culturally appropriate alternative to the Easter Bunny).

== Bases for segmenting business markets ==
{{See also|Industrial market segmentation}}

Segmenting business markets is more straightforward than segmenting consumer markets. Businesses may be segmented according to industry, business size, business location, turnover, number of employees, company technology, purchasing approach or any other relevant variables.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, B.P. and Bonoma, T.V., "How to Segment Industrial Markets," ''Harvard Business Review,'' May 1984, Online: https://hbr.org/1984/05/how-to-segment-industrial-markets&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely used segmentation bases used in business to business markets are geographics, and firmographics.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A., ''Handbook of Market Segmentation: Strategic Targeting for Business and Technology Firms, 3rd ed., Routledge, 2013, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The most-widely used bases for segmenting business markets are:

: Geographic segmentation occurs when a firm seeks to identify the most promising geographic markets to enter. Business can tap into business census type products published by Government departments to identify geographic regions that meet certain predefined criteria. 

: [[Firmographics]] (also known as ''emporographics'' or ''feature based segmentation'') is the business community's answer to demographic segmentation. It is commonly used in [[business-to-business]] markets (an estimated 81% of [[Business-to-business|B2B]] marketers use this technique). Under this approach the target market is segmented based on features such as company size, industry sector or location  usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and buying situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B2B Market Segmentation Research|url= http://www.circle-research.com/wp-content/uploads/B2B-market-segmentation-research.pdf |website=Circle Research|publisher=Circle Research|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A., ''Handbook of Market Segmentation: Strategic Targeting for Business and Technology Firms, 3rd ed., Routledge, 2013, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Key firmographic variables: standard industry classification (SIC); company size (either in terms of revenue or number of employees), industry sector or location (country and/or region), usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and buying situation

== Use in customer retention ==
{{see also|Relationship marketing}}

The basic approach to retention-based segmentation is that a company tags each of its active customers on four axes:

; Risk of customer cancellation of company service
: One of the most common indicators of high-risk customers is a drop off in usage of the company's service. For example, in the credit card industry, this could be signaled through a customer's decline in spending on his or her card.
; Risk of customer switching to a competitor
: Many times customers move purchase preferences to a competitor brand. This may happen for many reasons those of which can be more difficult to measure. It is many times beneficial for the former company to gain meaningful insights, through data analysis, as to why this change of preference has occurred. Such insights can lead to effective strategies for winning back the customer or on how not to lose the target customer in the first place.
; Customer retention worthiness
: This determination boils down to whether the post-retention profit generated from the customer is predicted to be greater than the cost incurred to retain the customer, and includes evaluation of [[Customer lifecycle management|customer lifecycles]].&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Sunil. Lehmann, Donald R. Managing Customers as Investments: The Strategic Value of Customers in the Long Run, pp. 70–77 (“Customer Retention” section). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education/Wharton School Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|0-13-142895-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Doug. [http://mindofmarketing.net/2012/05/what-is-customer-segmentation/ “What is Customer Segmentation?”] MindofMarketing.net, May 2007. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis of customer lifecycles is usually included in the [[Growth planning|growth plan]] of a business to determine which tactics to implement to retain or let go of customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Shelby |last2=Arnett |first2=Dennis |date=16 June 2004 |title=Market Segmentation Strategy, Competitive Advantage, and Public Policy |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.199.3118&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |publisher=Australasian Marketing Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |access-date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactics commonly used range from providing special customer discounts to sending customers communications that reinforce the value proposition of the given service.

== Segmentation: algorithms and approaches ==

The choice of an appropriate statistical method for the segmentation depends on a number of factors including, the broad approach ([[A priori knowledge|a-priori]] or [[Post hoc analysis|post-hoc]]), the availability of data, time constraints, the marketer's skill level and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J.H., ''Segmentation and Positioning for Strategic Marketing Decisions'', American Marketing Association, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A-priori segmentation ===

A priori research occurs when "a theoretical framework is developed before the research is conducted".&lt;ref&gt;Market Research Association, ''Glossary of Terms'', Online:http://www.marketingresearch.org/issues-policies/glossary&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the marketer has an idea about whether to segment the market geographically, demographically, psychographically or behaviourally before undertaking any research. For example, a marketer might want to learn more about the motivations and demographics of light and moderate users in an effort to understand what tactics could be used to increase usage rates. In this case, the target variable is known – the marketer has already segmented using a behavioural variable – '''user status'''. The next step would be to collect and analyze attitudinal data for light and moderate users. The typical analysis includes simple cross-tabulations, frequency distributions and occasionally logistic regression or one of a number of proprietary methods.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, pp 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main disadvantage of a-priori segmentation is that it does not explore other opportunities to identify market segments that could be more meaningful.

=== Post-hoc segmentation ===

In contrast, post-hoc segmentation makes no assumptions about the optimal theoretical framework. Instead, the analyst's role is to determine the segments that are the most meaningful for a given marketing problem or situation. In this approach, the empirical data drives the segmentation selection. Analysts typically employ some type of clustering analysis or structural equation modeling to identify segments within the data. The figure alongside illustrates how segments might be formed using clustering; however, note that this diagram only uses two variables, while in practice clustering employs a large number of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin, C., "Post-hoc Segmentation using Marketing Research," ''Economics'', Vol 12, no 3, 2012, pp. 39–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-hoc segmentation relies on access to rich datasets, usually with a very large number of cases and uses sophisticated algorithms to identify segments.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, pp 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical techniques used in segmentation ===

Marketers often engage commercial research firms or consultancies to carry out segmentation analysis, especially if they lack the statistical skills to undertake the analysis. Some segmentation, especially post-hoc analysis, relies on sophisticated statistical analysis.

[[File:Clustering.jpg|thumb|300px|Visualisation of market segments formed using clustering methods]]

Common statistical approaches and techniques used in segmentation analysis include:

* Clustering algorithms&lt;ref&gt;http://evgeniou,T., ''Cluster Analysis and Segmentation'', Online: inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/Report_s45.html [with worked example]&lt;/ref&gt; – overlapping, non-overlapping and fuzzy methods; e.g. [[K-means]] or other [[Cluster analysis]]

=== Data sources used for segmentation ===

Marketers use a variety of data sources for segmentation studies and market profiling. Typical sources of information include:&lt;ref&gt;US Government, Small Business Administration, Online: https://www.sba.gov/blogs/conducting-market-research-here-are-5-official-sources-free-data-can-help&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, C., "Big Data: 33 Brilliant and Ad Free Data Sources for 2016," ''Forbes'', 12 February 2016, Online: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/#7ef90b046796&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal sources ====

* Customer transaction records e.g. sale value per transaction, purchase frequency
* Patron membership records e.g. active members, lapsed members, length of membership
* Customer relationship management (CRM) databases
* In-house surveys
* Customer self-completed questionnaires or feedback forms

==== External sources ====
* Commissioned research (where the business commissions a research study and maintains exclusive rights to the data; typically the most expensive means of data collection)
* Data-mining techniques
* Census data (population and business census)
* Observed purchase behaviours
* Government agencies and departments
* Government statistics and surveys (e.g. studies by departments of trade, industry, technology etc)
* Omnibus surveys (a standard, regular survey with a basic set of questions about demographics and lifestyles where individual can add specific sets of questions about product preference or usage; generally lower cost than commissioned survey methods)
* Professional/Industry associations/Employer associations
* Proprietary surveys or tracking studies  (also known as ''syndicated research''; studies carried out by market research companies where business can purchase the right to access part of the data set)
* Proprietary databases/software&lt;ref&gt;Wedel, M. and Wagner, A., ''Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations,'' Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998, See Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nashville Fairgrounds Stadium''' is a planned [[soccer-specific stadium]] near the historic [[Nashville Fairgrounds]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. It will be the home of the [[Nashville MLS team]], a future [[Major League Soccer]] expansion franchise that will begin play in 2020.&lt;ref name="tennesseanmlsgrantsnashvilleexpansion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garrison|first1=Joey|last2=Organ|first2=Mike|title=MLS grants Nashville expansion club, propelling Music City from underdog to 'soccer city'|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nashvillesc/2017/12/20/mls-expansion-nashville-announcement-live-stream/947951001/|work=The Tennessean|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

The construction is expected to cost $275 million.&lt;ref name="tennesseanwhospayingfor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ammenheuser|first1=David|title=Who’s paying for Nashville’s MLS stadium?

As part of the public-private partnership, Mayor [[Megan Barry]] vowed to give "10 acres of city-owned fairgrounds land for a mix-use development next to the stadium" to the developers, including Ingram.&lt;ref name="tennesseannearingnashvillemlsstadium"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garrison|first1=Joey|title=Nearing Nashville MLS stadium vote, John Ingram makes final case for private development plan|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/11/04/nearing-nashville-mls-stadium-vote-john-ingram-makes-final-case-private-development-plan/832728001/|accessdate=December 6, 2017|work=The Tennessean|date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North Bay Growth &amp; Innovation Forum''' is a program created by the city of [[Santa Rosa, California]], and the city's [[chamber of commerce]]. The goal of the program is to enable the creation and growth of new businesses in the Santa Rosa area through education, mentoring and exposure to capital sources. The program matches angel or venture capital investors with aspiring entrepreneurs and/or existing businesses from start-up to mid-size.

At each forum topics may include fund raising, developing business plans and how best to leverage [[social media]].

The NBGIF series has won regional, statewide and national awards.

==History of NBGIF==
In 2006, realizing that the best strategy for business growth was to encourage “home grown” companies, the City and Chamber partnered on beta-testing the Venture Communities model created by Golden Capital Network, producing the first forum in October 2006. Three subsequent events were produced with Golden Capital’s assistance, and in the fall of 2008, the City and Chamber left the Golden Capital Network nest and transformed the Venture Communities model into the North Bay Growth &amp; Innovation Forum as it is today.

==Event format==
Since late 2008, Forum events have included: 
* Rapid Roundtables: An opportunity to learn from experts on topics such as “Due Diligence &amp; Negotiating the Deal,” “From Bootstrapping to Big Banks – Alternative Finance,” and “Best Practices in Internet Marketing – Leveraging SEO, Email and Social Networking;”
* Speakers on entrepreneurism, emerging market trends, taking advantage of a down economy and a review of the local entrepreneurial market;
* Poster exhibition from presenting entrepreneurs and selected local companies; and
* Company investment pitches to an investor panel.

Panelists at each event award "Best in Show" to the most promising presenting companies. Past "Best in Show" winners have included Seasons Studios, Mosaic Assist, True2Life Apparel and Aethos Technologies.

==Awards==
* 2007 Honorable Mention – Economic Development Programs; [[International Economic Development Council]]	
* 2008 Award of Merit for Economic Development Programs; California Association for Local Economic Development (CALED)
* 2009 The “Light Bulb” Went On, Innovative/Entrepreneurial Spirit; North Bay Leadership Council.

==Past participating companies==
Over 70 companies have participated in the program and have received more than $25 million in funding as a result. A few notable companies:
* Aeres Motors
* Autonet
* Barefoot Motors
* BarspaceTV
* Construction Exchange
* Displaire (now Pix2O)
* Mas Wine Company
* [[Red Condor]]
* Rotofactory
* Smart Motion
* VIDA Products
* Wave Track

==Coaching and mentoring==
NBGIF provides access to experts at no charge prior to each event to assist companies in strengthening their business plans and their presentation skills. One-on-one and group training and coaching are provided well in advance of the Forum, ensuring that the participants are well prepared to present their businesses in front of a panel of prospective investors. Participants and the audience get the benefit of  feedback from experienced entrepreneurs and investors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6343">{{about |the managerial practice of leaving office door open|the economic policy in China|Open Door Policy}}
An '''open door policy''' (as related to the [[business]] and [[corporate]] fields) is a communication policy in which a [[manager]], [[CEO]], MD, president or supervisor leaves their [[office]] door "open" in order to encourage openness and transparency with the employees of that company. As the term implies, employees are encouraged to stop by whenever they feel the need to meet and ask questions, discuss suggestions, and address problems or concerns with management. An open door policy is typically intended to foster an environment of [[collaboration]], high performance, and mutual respect between upper management and employees. 

{{quote|An open door policy means, literally, that every manager's door is open to every employee. The purpose of an open door policy is to encourage open communication, feedback, and discussion about any matter of importance to an employee.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.thebalance.com/open-door-policy-1918203 What Does an Open Door Policy at Work Mean?] - The Balance&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Benefits ==
Open door policies exist to encourage employees to offer suggestions and ideas, provide or solicit feedback, seek personal or professional counsel, or address concerns within the company. The policy establishes an environment of trust and mutual respect between the employer and employee. The practice is viewed as a [[morale]] booster by letting employees feel as if they are able to openly speak with their employer about issues face-to-face, rather than through [[e-mail]] or [[voicemail]]. In essence, an open door policy serves to empower employees, knowing that their voice is heard and issues are quickly addressed and resolved.&lt;ref name=hp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/diversity/open-door.html |title=HP Diversity: Open Door Policy |publisher=Hp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-11-30/business/bs-twp-infotek-corp-20111204_1_employee-benefits-open-door-policy-infotek |title=Baltimore's Top Workplaces: InfoTeK Corp.: Open-door policy - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust in the company tends to improve and grow, when employees understand that they are welcome to confide in senior management, when immediate supervisors are unavailable.&lt;ref name=sba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/open-door-policy-business-143.html |title=Open Door Policy in Business &amp;#124; Small Business - Chron.com |publisher=Smallbusiness.chron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
While open door policies intend to encourage and instill a sense of transparency and openness, some employees hesitate to speak their mind or be honest, for fear of intimidation, criticism, and censure. Management personnel may tend to communicate the willingness to hear suggestions, while belittling the suggestions when unaccompanied by solutions. 

Open door policies have also been seen as a way for companies to discourage the formation of [[labor unions]]. Formal, written policies may encourage openness, however, the response received in attempts to engage are often seen as threats to the authority or management style of the individual working in a supervisory or management capacity.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-44440188/is-your-open-door-policy-silencing-your-staff/ |title=Is Your 'Open Door' Policy Silencing Your Staff? |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, in essence, allows employees to forgo meeting with their immediate supervisors, choosing rather to engage in communication with their senior managers to discuss their employment or personal issues. 

A process of open communication and transparency allows employees to bypass their supervisors to engage with senior management. This may inadvertently lead to tension and strife between employees and middle management. Supervisors may either see this as an implication that they are the primary issue of concern, or they may feel threatened, suspecting the employee of undermining him in an attempt to cause problems between him and senior management.&lt;ref name=sba/&gt;

== Other uses ==
In other examples, commonly in college dorms,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} an open door policy means everyone's door must remain open. The idea remains the same, that having the door(s) open will make for a more comfortable and social school or work environment. 

Government officials at the local, state, and federal level often implement an open door policy for the purpose of meeting with constituents. In Salt Lake City, mayor [[Ralph Becker (mayor)|Ralph Becker]] maintains an open door policy every Wednesday to meet with residents one-on-one to discuss issues, concerns, and suggestions involving the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/event-108072-open-door-meetings-w.html |title=Open Door Meetings with Mayor Ralph Becker at City &amp; County Building |publisher=Cityweekly.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Caucus of Orange County, New York has maintained an open door policy for over ten years, where all individuals, regardless of political affiliation are welcome to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120121/OPINION/201210303/-1/SITEMAP&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, in an effort to introduce a more open and transparent government, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] of New York extended an open door policy to members of the public. A lottery was introduced that allowed for 300 New Yorkers to visit [[Gracie Mansion]] following the inaugural festivities. The following week, for the first time in the history of the State of New York, a lottery was held to open the State of the State Address to additional members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/131531/cuomo-extends-open-door-policy-to-governor-s-mansion/ |title=Cuomo Extends Open Door Policy To Governor's Mansion |publisher=NY1.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">'''Reassignment centers''' are holding facilities for the [[New York City Department of Education]], where more than 600 teachers accused of [[misconduct]] have been paid to work full-time doing nothing for months or years at a time while awaiting resolution of their cases.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=NYC to stop paying teachers to do nothing|date=2010-04-15|author=Sara Kugler| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9032803}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among teachers they are referred to as '''[[Padded cell|rubber rooms]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/education/10education.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Where Teachers Sit, Awaiting Their Fates | first=Samuel G. | last=Freedman | date=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city has 13 reassignment centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/0717,altman,76433,15.html village voice &gt; nyclife &gt; Class Dismissed by Mara Altman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Rubber Room]]'', it is also claimed that the city's teacher [[trade union|union]], the [[United Federation of Teachers]], neglects to provide proper representation to teachers assigned to reassignment centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03122007/news/regionalnews/rubber_room_teachers_demand_rights_regionalnews_david_andreatta____education_reporter.htm | work=New York Post | title='Rubber-Room' Teachers Demand Rights | first=DAVID ANDREATTA | last=Education | date=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exonerated teachers often become [[Absent Teacher Reserve|absent teacher reserve]] teachers.

==Uses==
The Department of Education blamed union rules that made it difficult to fire teachers. Some teachers assert that they have been sent to reassignment centers because they are [[whistleblowers]] against administrators for falsifying student test results or publicly challenging former [[New York City School Chancellor|Schools Chancellor]] [[Joel Klein]].&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;uft.org/news/teacher/top/axed/Whistle-blower axed — again&lt;/ref&gt; Three Department of Education employees speaking to the UFT's "New York Teacher," confirmed teachers' allegations that [[Fordham High School for the Arts]] principal Iris Blige filed allegations against the school's UFT [[shop steward|chapter leader]], to place her in a reassignment center, in order to intimidate her and to set an example to the school's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Callaghan, "Bronx principal alleged to have teacher 'hit list' still on job," "New York Teacher," April 23, 2009 {{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reassignment centers arose as a budgetary concern in bureaucratic studies and press coverage in Spring 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2008/05/04/2008-05-04_teachers_in_trouble_spending_years_in_ru.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Teachers in trouble spending years in 'rubber room' limbo that costs $65M | first=Erin | last=Einhorn | date=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost the city more than $65 million per year in labor expenses.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  In April, 2010, the city and teachers' union reached an agreement to end the practice.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  This agreement came in the midst of the first public presentation of a documentary on the centers.&lt;ref name="origin.ny1.com"&gt;http://origin.ny1.com/9-staten-island-news-content/news_beats/education/116973/doe-to-end--rubber-room--practice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rubber room agreement, the only substantive change has been that there are no longer large rooms filled with reassigned teachers. Teachers are typically reassigned within their own schools, or to other Department of Education buildings throughout the city. Although teachers are now being charged more quickly, it still takes several years to complete the hearing process and for the arbitrator to render a decision. Many teachers are subsequently brought up on "3020-a" charges, which refer to the section of the New York State education law dealing with the discipline of tenured teachers. Unlike any other school district in New York State, no independent panel must vote to prefer charges against a tenured teacher in New York City. The 3020-a trial is held before an independent arbitrator, who is paid by the [[New York State Education Department]] but is selected jointly by the New York City Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers.

In June 2012 it was revealed that the New York State Education Department had not paid its arbitrators for several years, and collectively owed them millions of dollars for cases they had completed, or were in the process of hearing. In frustration, ten of the 24 arbitrators on the New York City panel have quit, while the remaining 14 refuse to hear any testimony or issue any decisions until their back wages have been paid in full. This could take several more years to negotiate, further exacerbating the backlog of reassigned teachers.

==Documentary==
Filmmakers Jeremy Garrett and Justin Cegnar of Five Boroughs Productions produced an [[independent film|independent]] documentary on the centers, called [[Rubber Room (film)|''The Rubber Room'']],&lt;ref name="origin.ny1.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubberroommovie.com Rubber Room Movie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1232 This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for a segment on the radio program ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=350&lt;/ref&gt;

(IVN: TSX, NYSE &amp; NASDAQ), which he founded in 1994 and led to a successful initial public offering on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friedland Factor Pulls in $310.5 million|newspaper=Financial Post, Toronto, Canada|date=14 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Chairman, and later as Executive Chairman, until 2011. Exploration by Ivanhoe Mines since 2000 has discovered a chain of copper, gold and silver deposits at Oyu Tolgoi (Turquoise Hill) in Mongolia’s [[South Gobi]] region. The first phase of what is independently projected to be one of the world’s largest porphyry copper and gold mines is under construction at [[Oyu Tolgoi]] and is expected to begin commercial production in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Oyu Tolgoi: The Movie|url=http://www.ivanhoemines.com/i/Oyu_Video.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AMEC Minproc Technical Report, Oyu Tolgoi Project|url=http://www.ivanhoemines.com/i/pdf/IDP10_June062010.PDF|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ivanhoe Mines has discovered copper deposits in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/10/08/we-could-see-100-oil-again-soon-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think|title=We Could See $100 Oil Again Soon, But Not for the Reason You Think|last=Holmes|first=Frank|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ivanhoe Mines also has substantial interests in SouthGobi Resources, Ivanhoe Australia and Altynalmas Gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ivanhoe Mines increases stake in Altynalmas Gold to 50%|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuUAK_g9Dw0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedland was chairman of Galactic Resources which operated [[Summitville mine]], the site of the United States' worst cyanide release and mine bankruptcy and [[Superfund]] site. This mine closed in 1990 but continues to affect the region. It is estimated that at least $120 million will be required to clean up the bankrupt Galactic Resources mining site, which has damaged 17 miles of river. The former environmental manager of the facility has been indicted for intentionally dumping lead and cyanide directly into streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Summitville Mine | work =Region 8 - Superfund | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/region8/sf/sites/co/sville.html | accessdate = 2007-01-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061010032331/http://epa.gov/region8/sf/sites/co/sville.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper mines operated by Ivanhoe in [[Myanmar]] have recently come under scrutiny as environmental degradation, illicit company practices, as well as inside dealings with the ruling military junta have created ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Canada asked to probe driver’s disappearance. - Home Page | work = | publisher =Democratic Voice of Burma  | url =http://www.dvb.no/news/canada-asked-to-probe-driver%E2%80%99s-disappearance/10771  | accessdate = 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southgobi Resources controversy==
By 2005, Friedland had staked a claim larger than Greece in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, an area containing copper and gold at the Oyu Tolgoy, or Turquoise Hill, site that he claimed could be worth more than $100 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Financier's saga of risk promises Gobi riches|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=168|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 Sarah Armstrong, chief legal counsel of Southgobi Resources, was temporarily detained in Mongolia and prevented from leaving the country for several months due to allegations that company management had bribed Mongolian state officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SouthGobi Sands and Sarah Armstrong: Still No Official Statement from IAAC|url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=1631|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations resulted in the shutdown and search of SouthGobi headquarters in Mongolia by a Mongolian anti-corruption agency. Robert Friedland had been trying to sell his major (57.6%) stake in Southgobi Resources, which owned a major coal mining license in Mongolia, to Chalco, a Chinese state-owned corporation. Mongolian popular opposition to majority ownership by foreign state-owned enterprises of companies in their mining industry spurred action against the Southgobi deal and caused the suspension of the company's mining license for several months in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mongolia suspends SouthGobi licences|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/04/16/mongolia-suspends-southgobi-licences/|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2013 another chief financial officer at Southgobi Resources, Justin Capla who was previously questioned by Mongolian Anti Corruption Agency for bribing and money laundering actions case is being transferred to prosecution stage after 1 year of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SouthGobi Resources case is being transferred to prosecution|url=http://www.mongolnews.mn/i/42990|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Southgobi Resources ltd. is owned by Rio Tinto corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SouthGobi Resources widens Q4 loss on back of closed mine|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/southgobi-resources-widens-q4-loss-as-mine-remained-closed-2013-03-25|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mongolia: A Lucky but Difficult Pie to Slice|url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=1668|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fears for Aussie lawyer trapped in Mongolia|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/15184236/fears-for-aussie-lawyer-trapped-in-mongolia/|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WeeklySchedule.png|thumb|300px|An example of a weekly workplace schedule]]

A '''schedule''', often called a '''rota''' or '''roster''', is a list of [[employment|employees]], and associated information e.g. location, working times, responsibilities for a given time period e.g. week, month or sports season. 

A schedule is necessary for the day-to-day operation of many businesses e.g. [[retailing|retail store]], [[manufacturing]] facility and some [[offices]]. The process of creating a schedule is called '''scheduling'''. An effective workplace schedule balances the needs of stakeholders such as management, employees and [[customer]]s.

A ''daily'' schedule is usually ordered [[chronology|chronologically]], which means the first employees working that day are listed at the top, followed by the employee who comes in next, etc.  A ''weekly'' or ''monthly'' schedule is usually ordered [[collation|alphabetically]], employees being listed on the left hand side of a grid, with the days of the week on the top of the grid.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  In [[shift work]], a schedule usually employs a recurring [[shift plan]].

A schedule is most often created by a [[Management|manager]]. In larger operations, a [[human resources]] manager or scheduling specialist may be solely dedicated to creating and maintaining the schedule. A schedule by this definition is sometimes referred to as [[workflow]].{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Software is often used to enable organizations to better manage staff scheduling. Organizations commonly use [[spreadsheet]] software or [[employee scheduling software]] to create and manage shifts, assignments, and employee preferences. For large organisations employee scheduling can be complex,{{cn|date=October 2014}} and optimising this is framed as the [[Nurse scheduling problem]] in Operations Research.&lt;ref&gt;Math.edu [http://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/Teaching/OR2/Projects/P23/ORProject_Final_Copy.pdf "Nurse scheduling problem"]&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced employee scheduling software also provides ways to connect with the staff, ask for their preferences and communicate the schedule to them.&lt;ref name=NYT102812&gt;{{cite news|title=A Part-Time Life, as Hours Shrink and Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/a-part-time-life-as-hours-shrink-and-shift-for-american-workers.html|accessdate=October 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2012|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== On-call scheduling ==
An [[On call shift]] or On-call scheduling is a practice which requires employees to be available to be called onto last-minute shifts without pre-scheduling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2015/08/gap-ends-on-call-scheduling-gps-worker-bill-rights.html|title = Gap decides not to keep its store workers waiting|last = Sciacca|first = Annie|date = August 27, 2015|work = [[San Franc. Bus. Times|San Francisco Business Times]]|access-date = August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the practice has been opposed by [[labor rights]] groups as "unfair and detrimental to employees."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Transformational Government''' is the use of computer-based information and communications technologies (ICT) to change the way governments work.  The term is commonly used to describe a government reform strategy which attempts to radically change the way people understand government, especially those working within government.  For example, it is often associated with a 'whole-of-government' viewpoint, which tries to foster cross-department collaboration and provide 'one-stop-shop' convenience in the delivery of services to citizens.

The term ''Transformational Government'' is usually used aspirationally, as denoting the 'highest' level of what [[e-government]] can achieve:  
# presence, where ICT, and usually websites, are used to provide information; 
# interaction, where government interacts with citizens, and departments interact with each other, online especially by email;
# transaction, where such things as paying taxes or licenses are carried out online;
# transformation, which involves a reinvention of government functions and how they operate.&lt;ref name=Gartner&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gartner Group|title=  Gartner's Four Phases of E-Government Model.  Research Note Tutorials|year=  2000|url=http://www.gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to developing countries, it is often associated with hopes of reducing corruption, and in relation to developed countries, with attempts to increase the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors in government activity.

==History==
During the last two decades, governments around the world have invested in ICT with the aim of increasing the quality and decreasing the cost of public services.  But over that time, as even the least developed countries have moved to websites, e-services and e-Government strategies, it has become increasingly clear that e-Government has not delivered all the benefits that were hoped for it.&lt;ref&gt;‘The failure of e-government in developing countries: a literature review’. The Electronic Journal on Information System in Developing Countries. Dada, D. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  One study found that 35% of e-government projects in developing countries resulted in total failures; and that 50% were partial failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eGovernment as a Carrier of Context - IGovernment Working Paper No.15, Institute for Development Policy and Management, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K. Higher Education Admission Center (HEAC)  Heeks, R. (2004)|url=http://www.heac.gov.om/heac_en/index.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to these poor outcomes, there has been a shift of perspective to 'Transformational Government', aiming beyond purely technical aspects of better enabling e-government processes towards addressing the cultural and organisational barriers which have hindered public service benefits realisation. Researchers have defined the rationale for Transformational Government as “the exploitation of e-government such that benefits can be realized”.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic transformation of government in the UK: A
research agenda. European Journal of Information Systems 16, 327-335 Irani, Z., Elliman, T. and Jackson, P. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[OASIS (organization)|Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards]] (OASIS) published a report&lt;ref name="oasis-egov.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oasis-egov.org/library|title=Library of all approved outputs from the eGov Member Section - OASIS eGov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified a wide range of common pitfalls which have hampered many governments in achieving significant impacts through their technology investments.  However, OASIS also noted that:
:“…  an increasing number [of governments] are now getting to grips with the much broader and complex set of cultural and organizational changes which are needed for ICT to deliver significant benefits to the public sector. This new approach is generally referred to as Transformational Government.”

OASIS cites &lt;ref name="oasis-egov.org"/&gt; the UK and Australia as two of the leaders in this area:
: “Transformational Government…. encompasses a new "virtual" business layer within government which allows an integrated, government-wide, citizen-focused service to be presented to citizens across all channels, but at no extra cost and without having to restructure government to do so. Two very good examples of this new approach are South Australia’s “Ask Just Once” portal and the UK Government’s DirectGov portal, and the approach is explained in very good detail in the CS Transform’s white paper entitled "Citizen Service Transformation – a manifesto for change in the delivery of public services”.

== Countries with Transformational Government Initiatives ==
Within the last decade, this new emphasis on a Transformational Government approach can be seen from a number of countries:

:“One of the key principles of Government On-Line is that programs and services will be transformed to reflect the needs and expectations of clients and citizens.  From the government’s perspective, the overall objective of the GOL initiative is full service transformation – to fundamentally change the way the government operates and to deliver better services to Canadians.”

==International initiatives==
The early pioneering work by some governments is now being picked up and championed by a range of global organizations which offer support to governments in moving to a Transformational Government approach. For example:
*The [[World Bank]] has set up an eTransform Initiative (ETI) with support from global IT partners such as Gemalto, IBM, L-1 Identity Solutions, Microsoft and Pfizer.  "The eTransform Initiative is about tapping information technology, expertise and experiences”, said Mohsen Khalil, Director of the World Bank Group’s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department.  “Government transformation is about change management facilitated by technology.  This initiative will facilitate the exchange of lessons and experiences among various governments and industry players, to maximize impact and lower risks of ICT-enabled government transformation.”
*A number of private sector organizations working in this area have published white papers which pull together global best practices on Government Transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/industry/publicsector/government/csp/solutions_directory.aspx|title=Microsoft in Government: technology solutions for government agencies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstransform.com/|title=Citizen Service Transformation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstransform.com/|title=Citizen Service Transformation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/Institute_For_Public_Service_Value/Research/Front-Office-Shared-Services.htm Sharing Front Office Services: The Journey to Citizen-Centric Delivery, Accenture 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
*OASIS launched (September 2010) a new Technical Committee tasked with producing a new global best practice standard for a Transformational Government Framework.  The Framework is expressed as a number of "Pattern Languages", each providing a detailed set of guidance notes and conformance clauses on how to deliver the required changes in practice.
