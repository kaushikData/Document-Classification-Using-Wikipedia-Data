'''Alan Heusaff, '''also '''Alan Heussaff''' (23 July 1921 in [[Saint-Yvi]], Finistère – 3 November 1999 in [[Galway]]) was a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Breton nationalism|nationalist]], linguist, dictionary compiler, prolific journalist and lifetime campaigner for solidarity between the [[Celts (modern)|Celtic peoples]]. A co-founder of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] in 1961, he was its first general secretary until 1984.

A native [[Breton language|Breton]] speaker, he trained as a primary school teacher but in his early twenties joined the separatist [[Bezen Perrot]] militia (1943–44), for which he was sentenced to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' at a court martial by the post-World War II French government, but eventually amnestied in 1967. After studying mathematics and physics at the [[University of Marburg]], Germany, he arrived in Ireland in 1950. He continued his studies at [[University College, Galway]], and, on graduation, joined the [[Irish Meteorological Service]], becoming a naturalised Irish citizen in 1955.

An aviation [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], he devoted his spare time and retirement to peaceful activism, promoting the languages, culture and autonomy of the [[Celtic countries]]. Among the honours he received for his work was the 1986 ''[[Gradam an Phiarsaigh]]'' (annual Pearse award) presented by the President of Ireland, [[Patrick Hillery]]. In the same year, at the Welsh [[Eisteddfod]], he was elected as a [[Bard]] of the Welsh [[Gorsedd]]. He was fluent in all the six modern Celtic languages as well as English, French and German.

==Death==
Heusaff died on 3 November 1999, at his home near [[An Spidéal]] in [[Connemara]], [[Galway]]. He married Bríd Ní Dhochartaigh in 1953 (died 2 February 2008); the couple had six children, four girls and two boys.

==Youth in Brittany==
Heusaff was born in 1921 in [[Saint-Yvi|Sant Ivi]], near [[Rosporden]], now in [[Kernev]] ([[Cornouaille]], [[Departments of France|Department]] of [[Finistère]]). His family originated in nearby [[Toulgoat]] and his parents, Sébastien and Mari Heusaff, were native Breton speakers. Heusaff spoke only Breton at the time he was sent to school.(1) When Heusaff was growing up it was estimated there were well over a million native speakers of this Celtic language. In 1925 the French Minister of Education, [[Anatole de Monzie]], made clear the Government policy: "''For the linguistic unity of France, Breton must be exterminated''". Now banned by law was the teaching of language, literature, history, folklore and anything interpreted as "nationalist". (2)

Arriving in a French-speaking school in these circumstances profoundly affected the boy. His community's language was openly vilified and children were punished if caught speaking it. Nevertheless, Heusaff had a good ear for languages and eventually joined the [[École Normale]] in Kemper ([[Quimper, Finistère]]) where he trained as a primary-school teacher. He continued to be acutely aware of the state's policy on Breton. Most native speakers, under these conditions, were made illiterate in their own language by the state. Yet Breton was an old literary language with the first manuscripts in it surviving from a century earlier than such manuscripts in French.(3)

To teach himself literacy in Breton, Heusaff sent for a correspondence course from [[Skol-Ober]] founded in 1932 by [[Marc'harid Gourlaouen]] (1902–1987). As it was not politic to do so openly, he found help from a native speaker who offered the use of his address as a post-restante to receive the lessons. In an interview in 2005 with the historian Daniel Leach, his widow, Bríd Heusaff commented on the effect of his school experience on his life: "''I'm fairly certain that if Breton had been taught at school when Alan went there… and if there had been some respect for it, that he would never have become involved in the Breton movement at all. Because his main interest, really, was the language''". (4)

In 1938, as a teenager, Heusaff joined the [[Breton National Party|Parti National Breton]] (PNB) which sought to re-assert [[Breton independence]]. The crowns of [[Brittany]] and France had become unified by the marriage of [[Anne of Brittany]] to [[Charles VIII of France]], as a condition following the defeat of the Breton armies at the [[Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488)|Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier]] in 1488. Following the death of Charles VIII in 1498, Anne was forced to marry his cousin, [[Louis XII of France]], to ensure the French crown's continued control of Brittany. Under the ''Traité d'Union de la Bretagne à la France'', 18 September 1532, the Breton Parliament remained in being until the [[French National Assembly]], following the [[French Revolution]], arbitrarily abolished it in 1790. This caused a complicated situation in Brittany as many Bretons had spearheaded the Revolution as a means of overthrowing the centralist politics of the French monarchy.(5)

Heusaff stated in 1970: "From 1938 onwards I shared the conviction that Brittany could never regain her freedom "by consent"; the French state would use all its strength to prevent that ever happening. I agreed that we should seek external support, wherever it came from, because we were too weak to attain our aims alone. Why should we not do what all free countries do when their freedom is threatened; seek alliances? By doing so we were affirming that we were already free".(6)

Heusaff joined the PNB's uniformed but unarmed [[Bagadoù Stourm]] and then gravitated to the [[Kadervenn]] group of PNB, which believed in direct action. He became convinced that only separation from France would save both the language and the cultural identity, which he believed was dependent on its survival. Like many other Breton nationalists, he was greatly influenced by the Irish example of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. From the experience of their fellow Celts of Ireland during World War I, many young Bretons came to believe that if war were to break out again, then France's difficulty would be Brittany's opportunity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==German occupation==
In 1940, German forces overwhelmed France and [[Marshal of France]] [[Philippe Pétain]] signed an [[Armistice]]. The establishment in July of Marshal Pétain's [[Vichy France|French collaborationist government in Vichy]], however, still gave it legal authority not only in the "unoccupied south" but also in northern and western France occupied by the German [[Wehrmacht]]. Many Breton militants soon realised that Germany was of little support. Rather than help the Bretons achieve their freedom, the German Occupation allowed the French collaborationist government of Vichy to remove a large section of Brittany, the department of [[Loire-Atlantique]], in 1941. This area included Naoned ([[Nantes]]) the capital and seat of the Dukes of Brittany. The transformation of ancient Breton borders was something post-war governments were happy to inherit. With German approval, Vichy suppressed the [[Breton National Committee]] (Comité national Breton, CNB, which had been declared by nationalists in 1940) and its journal [[L'Heure Bretonne]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

From 1941, as resistance to the occupiers grew, Breton nationalism became more divided. Moderates adopted a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutralist]] position, imitating that of neutral Ireland. But others, including militant activist Célestin Lainé (later known as Neven Henaff), continued to make overtures to the Nazis, hoping for their support for an independent Brittany with ties to Germany. The more supportive nationalists were of Germany, they reasoned, the more likely Berlin would be to abandon Vichy and create a Breton state.(7) The war divide within Brittany as a whole deepened at the same time and members of the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], the [[French Resistance]], began to view all Breton nationalists as potential [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]. They allegedly began a policy of assassination of leading Bretons in September 1943. [[Yann Bricler]], a PNB official in Kemper and manager of the PNB magazine [[Stur]], was shot dead in his office. Another nationalist, [[Yves Kerhoas]], was also assassinated. On 12 December 1943, [[Abbé Yann Vari Perrot]], the 66-year-old parish priest of [[Scrignac]], was shot dead on the steps of his church. Perrot had been decorated for his services in World War I, but was a native speaker and leading cultural Breton nationalist, playwright and writer, involved in devising a standard orthography for the language.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Célestin Lainé]] had led an underground physical force movement, [[Gwenn ha du (terrorism)|Gwenn-ha-Du]] (black and white, named after the Breton national flag) from 1930, had organised militant groups such as [[Lu Brezon]], renamed [[Bezen Kadoudal]], and now saw the opportunity to organise an open, uniformed and armed group – Bezen Perrot. The conditions of this unit was that it would not fight outside the borders of Brittany but remain as "a protective militia" against the French Maquis's attempts to eliminate Breton activists. But as the conflict on the ground intensified and German reprisals became more ferocious, the authorities took the Bezen Perrot and other groups in hand. By 1944, they had provided the unit with uniforms and weapons, and listed them as a unit of the SD, [[Sicherheitsdienst]]. Lainé made clear that Bezen Perrot's war was against France and was on behalf of Brittany not Germany. But although he was reported as concerned that the unit should not operate on behalf of the SD it was used by them and mounted guard on the SD interrogation centre in [[Rennes]]. In the months before and after the [[D-Day landings]] in June 1944, atrocities were reported on all sides of the conflict in Brittany.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Heusaff had been working as a primary school teach at [[Kerien]] ([[Querrien]]) and between 1941 and 1942 he began to write articles about the problems of Brittany under the pseudonym "Mab Ivi" (Son of Ivi, his home village). Others articles appeared in ''L'Heure Bretonne" and "[[Arvor]]''. In 1942, he resigned his teaching post. Heusaff had become a ''kerrenour'' (lieutenant) in [[Bezen Kadoudal]], which, in December 1943, became Bezen Perrot and which Heusaff saw as the nucleus of a Breton independence army.(8)

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We were prepared to co-operate with the devil himself, if that would get rid of the French. The French were the greatest enemies of the Breton people".(9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A fuller account of the Bezen Perrot, including Heusaff's role, is given in Daniel Leach's ''Fugitive Ireland'' (Four Courts Press, 2009). Among controversies, Leach deals with some later accusations depicting Heusaff as a member of the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force|LVF]], showing them to be unfounded. The main focus of the book is an analysis of why Ireland gave [[right of asylum|asylum]] after the war to some Bretons and other foreign militants who had collaborated with Axis forces. Controversies on these issues are also elucidated in Leach's article ''"Irish Post-War Asylum: Nazi sympathy, Pan Celticism or raisons d'etat?"'' (''History Ireland'', May/June 2007). (10)

In June 1944, shortly after D-Day, Heusaff was at [[Ploërdut]], Morbihan, with members of the Bezen Perrot, when they became involved in a firefight with members of a [[Free French Forces|Free French]] commando unit. He was seriously wounded in the shoulder and lung. Two others members of his unit  were killed. Locals took Heusaff to hospital where he remained for a few weeks before evacuated to a German hospital in [[Montabaur]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where he remained until September 1944.

While in hospital, he was visited by [[Friedrich Hielscher]], the poet, philosopher and journalist. He had connections with the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für keltische studien]] (German Society for [[Celtic Studies]]) in [[Berlin]] and had been on a research trip to Brittany in 1943. It is suspected that he took this trip on behalf of the [[Abwehr]], or the [[Ahnenerbe]], which came under the [[SS]]. According to some reports, Hielscher had been involved in a resistance circle to the Nazis since the 1930s, helping Jews and others in danger from the regime. Indeed, Hielsher had contacts with members of oppressed "peuples de culture" since 1927 and some members of his group were arrested as early as 1933. (11)

On leaving hospital in late 1944, Heusaff found Breton contacts in [[Strasbourg]] and spent time there. Other Bezen Perrot members were living there under assumed identities. Heusaff joined them and adopted the name Bernhard Heubacher, receiving papers with Hielscher's help. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Until 1947, he worked in [[forestry]], It was a frugal existence, sometimes he was forced to live on [[nettle soup]]. With Hielscher's help, he entered the university to study Physics and Maths. He remained there until 1950. Then he decided to follow other Breton militants who had sought asylum in Ireland. The Allies had swept through [[Brittany]] in August 1944, and as the Germans retreated, many of the Bezen Perrot had fled to Germany as well. On 19 September 1944, the Germans on the [[Crozon Peninsula]] had surrendered but pockets in [[L'Orient]] and in [[Saint-Nazaire]] did not surrender until May 1945. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The former Mayor of [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Victor Pierre Le Gorgeu|Dr Le Gorgeu]], an opponent of Breton nationalism, had taken over civil administration and started a round-up of Breton nationalists. By November 1944, 2,000 Bretons were arrested including priests, women, children and even Bretons who had fought in the Resistance. Some had purportedly done little more than attend a Breton language class; others died of ill treatment in prison. Prisoners from the Rennes Central Gaol reportedly often appeared before the examining magistrate with broken limbs and bruises. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} By the end of 1946, 3,000 Bretons had been put in special camps; 300 of them had been sentenced to [[penal servitude]] for varying terms and 60 sentenced to death. Others had been sentenced to terms of "civil degradation", a loss of all civil rights as citizens and removal of qualifications. Of those involved in the Breton movement, 38 had been killed and 9 executed by firing squad, according to contemporary sources such as the Welsh newspaper ''[[Baner Ac Amserau Cymru]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Heusaff could not return to Brittany. Like others who went to Ireland for asylum, he was sentenced to death ''in absentia'', not for war crimes, but for the crime of "attacks upon the integrity of the French State".(14) He was to receive an amnesty in 1967, along with other Breton militants. Heusaff took his wife to Brittany for the first time in 1967 but were forbidden to visit Finistère, his home department. This restriction was lifted in the early 1970s. From then on until his death, Heusaff returned to Brittany on many occasions. His family had in no way supported his wartime activities and, indeed, his brother had served in the French Army and become a prisoner of war.(15)

==Meteorology==
On 20 May 1950, Heusaff left Marburg under the alias "Bernard Heubacher", and travelled through [[Belgium]] to England and [[Wales]], and then to Ireland, where he enrolled in [[University College, Galway]], to finish his degree. To finance himself, he taught German classes. One of his students was Bríd Ní Dhochartaigh from the [[Fanaid Gaeltacht]] in [[County Donegal]]. In 1953, the couple married and had six children. He had learned to speak Irish fluently. The couple's two sons and four daughters were raised as an Irish speaking family.(16)

Heusaff joined the [[Irish Meteorological Service]] in 1952, still as Bernard Heubacher, and worked at [[Dublin Airport]] for eighteen months before being transferred to Shannon Airport. He became a naturalised citizen under his own name in 1955. In 1958, the Heusaff family moved back to [[Dublin]]. He worked at Dublin Airport for the rest of his career. Interested in ecological matters, he also spent time researching the history of weather patterns as recorded in Irish annals and documents from earliest times. After his death, Brendan McWilliams, director of the service, and a well-known ''Irish Times'' columnist, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Alan spent his entire working life in aviation meteorology…. In addition to his operational duties, he made brave efforts over a period of 15 years to bring the ancient climate of our island into focus, delving into historical documents to identify and record whatever mention might be made of the weather. He found many such references, and unearthed nearly 1,000 useful records extending over 1,400 years from AD 490 to 1829 which, collectively, have added significantly to knowledge of the Irish climate in the centuries gone by".''&lt;/blockquote&gt; McWilliams adds: "He was a meticulous and conscientious meteorologist, and I personally remember him as always cheerful, courteous and eager to help to solve whatever operational problems might arise." (17)

==The Celtic League==
The formation of The Celtic league is regarded as Heusaff's major achievement. The modern philosophy of [[Pan-Celticism]], of co-operation between the six modern Celtic nations (the Irish, Manx, Scots, Welsh, Cornish and Bretons) had first been given published form by [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]] (1837–1880), a Breton language poet. The League was born in a meeting at the Eisteddfod at [[Rhos (north Wales)|Rhos]], near [[Llangollen]], in North Wales in 1961.(18) The principal aims were then: (1) to foster co-operation between the national movements in the Celtic countries, particularly in efforts to obtain international recognition and to share the experiences of their struggles and exchange constructive ideas. (2)

Heusaff was elected general secretary, a position he held until 1984–85. An existing magazine ''[[Celtic Voice]]'' was offered as a means of propagating the League. By the second annual meeting on 30 September 1962, the League had branches in all six Celtic countries, as well as in London. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The League then launched its own quarterly journal ''[[Celtic News]]'', initially edited by Welsh historian Dr. [[Ceinwen Thomas]] of [[University College, Cardiff]]. From 1963 until 1971, an annual volume was also published constituting up to 180 pages. ''Celtic News'' continued under various editors until a more professionally produced journal, ''[[Carn]]'', was launched in the Spring of 1973, with [[Frank Thomson]], a Scottish writer and journalist, as its first editor. Still published quarterly, ''Carn'' carries articles in all six Celtic languages, as well as in English and French. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Gwynfor Evans MP continued as President until 1972, while Vice-Presidents consisted of leaders of the main political national parties, such as Dr [[Yann Fouéré]] of the [[Mouvement Pour l'Organisation de la Bretagne]]; Dr [[Robert McIntyre]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] (and its first Member of Parliament) and [[Robert Dunstone]], the president of the Cornish movement, [[Mebyon Kernow]]. However, by 1972, it was decided that conflicts of interest were arising and that the League should elect its own independent president and officials. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Such a conflict had arisen in 1969 at the League's annual meeting it Dublin when Gwynfor Evans used his League office to speak of Plaid Cymru policies which conflicted with attitudes in other Celtic countries. [[Pádraig Ó Conchúir]] became the first "chairman" replacing Gwynfor Evans. Later the officer of "chairman" was replaced by "convenor". {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Under Heusaff, the League gave evidence to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1963 concerning the persecution of the Breton language. This aroused media attention. The League sent an official delegation to the 14th Congress of the [[Federal Union of European Nationalities]] (representing [[ethnic minorities]]), and in November 1965, the League delivered a 62-page memorandum, arguing the case for self-government for the Celtic countries to the United Nations Organization and distributed it in 1966 to members of the [[Council of Europe]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The League also took a leading part in other campaigns, for example, monitoring submarine activity in the [[Irish Sea]] where they refused to surface, snaring [[fishing net]]s and causing the loss of boats and lives. Ensuing publicity over the years to these incidents brought the League into the mainstream. Another success was the League's spearheading of a campaign to transfer the ownership of the bird island sanctuary, the [[Calf of Man]], from the [[English National Trust]] to the [[Manx National Trust]]. The League soon made the idea of Pan-Celticism a public issue and forced the academic [[Celtic Congress]] into actions such as adopting a "Charter of Cultural Rights". In 1979, a [[Celtic Media Festival|Celtic Film and Television Festival]] was inaugurated and in 1981 [[UNESCO]] launched their permanent "Project for the Study and Promotion of Celtic Cultures". Conferences, book fairs, television programmes, and an International Federation of [[Celtic Wrestling]] was formed. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The burgeoning of the Celtic idea came from Heusaff's original vision. Although he resigned office around 1985, he continued to work for the League. As a tribute to his work, The Celtic League published that year a ''festschrift'' in his honour ''For A Celtic Future'', of essays by many leading Celticists, and edited by [[Cathal Ó Luain]], who had become convenor of the League.

Upon his retirement from the Meteorological Service in 1986, Alan and Bríd moved to Seanadh Gharráin, near Spidéal, [[County Galway]], where he concentrated on his [[lexicographical]] work, kept up a voluminous correspondence with his Celtic contacts, and remained involved in the League. In July 1990, Heusaff wrote of the future of the League:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The Celtic League has a role to play in stimulating Inter Celtic contacts, Inter Celtic solidarity, which could express itself in contributing to pressure on politicians and international/European institutions to steer developments in Europe towards full recognition of the rights of our nations including languages. Other Inter Celtic organizations exist (i.e. Celtic Congress), also Inter Celtic events (Film and Television Festival. Celtic Congress of Writers etc.) – but we are the only association so far working on a continuous or permanent basis. We need to think about what contribution the Celtic peoples and their cultures can make to the development of European unity, to formulate proposals and suggestions, disseminating them, instead of adopting an aloof sort of attitude. We lack people to do this work. Many European peoples have something like an attachment to Celtic matters. I believe we should appeal to them to help to get recognition and the freedom we need to realize our national aims. Our problem is to bring young people to join in the work. The cosmopolitanization of culture, which now rules supreme, the control of the media by the agents of uniformity, are great obstacles to our progress."''(19)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Before he died, it was arranged that all Heusaff's papers connected with the Celtic League should be deposited in the [[National Library of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]], and are classified as ''681, Celtic League Archive''.

==Irish language activist==
Heusaff and his wife were members of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] and involved in [[Na Teaghlaigh Ghaelacha]], an organisation for Irish speaking families. Bríd became a member of the Executive of Conradh na Gaeilge and was very active in Irish language activities. Heusaff took part in Irish language campaigns such as [[Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta]] and was the first person to refuse, on principle, to pay a television licence because of [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]'s (RTÉ) neglect of Irish language programmes. This campaign ultimately resulted in the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge (later [[TG4]]) in 1996. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1986 Irish President, [[Patrick Hillery]], presented him with the ''Gradam an Phiarsaigh'' annual award for promoting the ideals of [[Patrick Pearse]]. Later that year, he was elected as a [[Bard]] of the Welsh [[Gorsedd]], as "Gwenerzh" (Muse) as having made a distinguished contribution to the Welsh nation, language and culture.(20)

==Breton language scholar==
While working for the language and culture of his adopted country, Heusaff never ceased to promote the [[Breton language]] and the struggle of his native country for independence. He taught Breton language classes in his spare time in Dublin and became a prolific journalist in Breton, editing ''[[Argoad]]'', a Breton language news bulletin, with an English edition ''[[Breton News]]'', which he founded in 1959. He also contributed to Breton language magazines in Brittany such as ''[[Hor Yezh]]'', ''[[Galva (magazine)|Galva]]'', ''[[Breman]]'', ''[[Gwalarn]]'', ''[[Arvor]]'', ''[[Ar Bed Keltiek]]'', ''[[An Amzer]]'' and ''[[Al Liamm]]''. The first all-Breton dictionary, ''[[Geriadur Brezhoneg]]'', published by [[An Here]] in 1995, cited Heusaff as a major contributor. This provoked some protest given renewed controversies in Brittany over his and others' wartime background. Heusaff also published a dictionary of his own dialect of Sant Ivi as ''Geriaoueg Sant Ivi'', initially in the magazine ''Hor Yezh'' between 1962–73. A revised version of the work was issued in book form in 1996.(21)

'''Amarna letter EA 156''', titled: ''"Aziru of Amurru"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 156, ''"Aziru of Amurru"'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; is a very short letter from [[Aziru]], the leader of the region of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]]. EA 156 is the first letter in a series of 16 letters regarding Aziru.

In synopsis, the 16 letters talk of servitude to the [[Pharaoh]]:
*The development of a city;
*The desire to visit [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], by Aziru (or his son);
*The warfare 2 days distant in [[Nuhassa|Nuhasse]] by the kings of the region;
*The continued sending and receiving of [[courier|messenger]]s.
*A letter to Aziru, when visiting Egypt.
*A final conditions letter (players and regions).

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1360 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the [[text corpus|body]] of letters.

Letter EA 156 (also see here-(Obverse): [https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=P271199]), is numbered VAT 337, from the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].

Written by [[Steven Blush]], '''''American Hardcore: A Tribal History''''' is a [[Journalism|journalistic]] book that relates the history of the [[hardcore punk]] movement that took place in [[Northern America]] between 1980 and 1986. It was first published by [[Feral House]] in October 2001.

The book was the basis of the [[documentary film]] ''[[American Hardcore (film)|American Hardcore]]'' (2006), directed by [[Paul Rachman]].

==Cover art==
The [[book cover]] features a [[Hand-colouring of photographs|colorize]]d version by [[Doc Hammer|Eric Hammer]] of a black-and-white photograph, taken by [[Edward Colver]], portraying Danny Spira, lead singer of Los Angeles hardcore punk band [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]], performing in 1981 at Godzilla's, a former bowling alley, nightclub, and music venue in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]], California.{{refn|group=nb|Blush [2001] 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;8}}

==Second edition (2010)==
Feral House released an extended second edition on November 1, 2010. In this practically new book, the author updated all of the chapters, added a new one titled "Destroy Babylon", which explores the mutant forms of spirituality that came from the movement, and interviewed over twenty-five new subjects.  Blush also has unearthed over a hundred new pieces of artwork, drafted two hundred plus new band bios, and radically expanded discography.  Most significant, he has offered a new conclusion which is an anomaly within the realm of period studies. The original book was 328 pages, and the revised edition 408.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhardcorebook.com ''American Hardcore: A Tribal History'', official website]. ''American Hardcore Book''.

'''''Ancient Discoveries''''' is a [[television series]] that premiered on December 21, 2003, on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. The program focused on ancient [[technology|technologies]].  The show's theme was that many [[invention]]s which are thought to be modern have ancient roots or in some cases may have been lost and then reinvented.  The program was a follow-up to a special originally broadcast in 2005 which focused on technologies from the [[Ancient Roman]] era such as the [[Antikythera mechanism]] and inventors such as [[Heron of Alexandria]].  Episodes of the regular series expanded to cover other areas such as [[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[East Asia]], and the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].

''Ancient Discoveries'' was made for The History Channel by Wild Dream Films based in [[Cardiff (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff]] in the UK. Much of the filming was on location across the world. The series used contributions from archaeologists and other experts, footage of historical sites and artifacts, computer generated reconstructions, and dramatized reconstructions along with experiments and tests on reconstructed artifacts.

}}A '''company code of conduct''' is a document written up voluntarily by a company in which sets out a set of principles that it commits itself to follow. In some cases, codes of conduct reach suppliers, subcontractors and third parties. It is a type of [[code of conduct]].

The company code of conduct appeared in the 1970s but in the course of the 1990s process that multinational corporations (MNE) generally began to create and disseminate to the public many codes of conduct to those who undertake to adjust their activities.

It is about a phenomenon with regards to MNEs and their relationship with workers, society and the environment. They have also generated extensive debates about the conditions of their validity and their control, which in turn has led to the creation of "multinational enterprise observatories"

A company code of conduct is related to the International Framework Agreements (sometimes also called bilateral codes of conduct) that a coupe of MNEs have signed with World Trade Unions, as well as with the multilateral codes of conduct that have been signed by companies with trade unions, [[NGOs]], environmental organizations, consumer organizations, etc.

== Contents ==
The content of a company code of conduct varies and depends in a measure of the company's culture and on the country in which they reside. In general terms, it can be said that the codes of conduct are related to anti-corruption issues, [[labor law]], [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and basic legal issues, such as the rejection of [[Slavery]], [[child labor]], compliance with the environmental standards of each country, and in general respect for national laws.

In general an existing company code of conduct only applies to the parent company and sometimes with restrictions in the subsidiaries. Only exceptionally, codes of conduct apply to suppliers and other subcontractors.

==Cases==

===Nike===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Nike's company code of conduct is one of the best known.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In the early 1990s, Nike was reported by the press in the [[United States]] for using contractors in [[Southeast Asia]] who employed [[slave labor]] and [[child labor]]. This complaint damaged Nike's image and was reflected in a significant drop in sales.

As part of a strategy to recover their image, Nike announced in 1992 a company code of conduct in which it stated its commitment to adjust the company's actions around the world to adhere to its rules, as well as to require all subcontractors to do the same. (Nike directly employs 22,000 employees and indirectly 450,000 workers through subcontractors around the world.) Shortly afterward, a series of criticisms was received from the [[Trade union|unions]] about the content of its code of conduct, and so Nike created a new text which is the one that is currently presented.

==The issue of Monitoring==
One of the first issues that was raised by the company code of conduct was monitoring their compliance. It has been considered that it is not reliable that the monitoring is conducted by the company itself. Some companies reach out to external companies to conduct the monitoring. In other cases companies have accepted that certain [[NGOs]] proceed with monitoring, but unions have complained that this activity of [[NGOs]] has been used repeatedly as an alternative to trade union action and to replace the [[Trade union|union]] in front of the workers.

==Issues that have raised==
Codes of conduct are related to the [[corporate social responsibility]]. A couple of investigations have pointed out that codes of conduct carry the risk of displacing the importance of mandatory national and international standards.

The [[United Nations]] Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) has estimated a few hundred existing company code of conduct. It is a reasonably small amount to reach multinational corporations acting globally. The [[UNCTAD]] has estimated 65,000 parent companies which own about 850,000 [[subsidiary]] are foreigners in all countries around the world, and employ the majority of their workers through [[outsourcing]].

[[Trade unions]] and some [[NGOs]] have criticized the unilateral nature of codes of conduct and have emphasized that they are often only aimed to improve the public image of businesses.

The non-inclusion of suppliers, subcontractors and outsourced companies in codes of conduct has also been pointed out by trade unions and NGOs as a serious disadvantage, as it is precisely where he majority of workers work and where they produce the majority of violations.

The legal validity of the same and the ways to enforce compliance it is also being discussed.

Feminists argue that military conscription is sexist because wars typically serve the interests of the [[patriarchy]], therefore the military is inherently a sexist institution. They say conscription of men normalizes male violence, conscripts are indoctrinated into sexism and violence against women, and military training socializes conscripts into patriarchal gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michalowski|first1=Helen|title=Five feminist principles and the draft|journal=Resistance News|date=May 1982|issue=8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neudel|first1=Marian Henriquez|title=Feminism and the Draft|journal=Resistance News|date=July 1983|issue=13|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While not all feminists are anti-militarists, opposition to war and militarism has been a strong current within the women's movement. Prominent suffragists like Quaker [[Alice Paul]], and [[Barbara Deming]], a feminist activist and thinker of the 1960s and '70s, were ardent pacifists. Moreover, feminist critique has often regarded the military as a hierarchical, male-dominated institution promoting destructive forms of power." &lt;ref name="National Catholic Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaeffer-Duffy|first1=Claire|title=Feminists weigh in on draft registration for women|url=http://ncronline.org/news/politics/feminists-weigh-draft-registration-women|accessdate=29 June 2016|date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have been organizers and participants in resistance to conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Letters from draft-age women about why they wouldn't register for the draft|journal=Resistance News|date=1 March 1980|issue=2|page=6|ref=http://www.resisters.info/#womenreg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gestation: Women and Draft Resistance|journal=Resistance News|date=November 1982|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and the resistance movement|journal=Resistance News|date=8 June 1986|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration of women into militaries, and especially into combat forces, did not begin on a large scale until late in the 20th century. In his book ''The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys'' (2012), philosopher [[David Benatar]] states that the theoretical arguments are immaterial to those who are pressed into service: "Some women are excluded from combat, but many more women are exempt. While some men are excluded from combat (because they fail the relevant tests), many more are pressured or forced into combat." According to Benatar, "[t]he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted and, similarly, that only males should be forced into combat". This, he believes, "is a sexist assumption".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|102}}

In upholding that law's exclusion of women, the court stated: 'In providing for involuntary service for men and voluntary service for women, Congress followed the teachings of history that if a nation is to survive, men must provide the first line of defense while women keep the home fires burning.'

The '''corporation counsel''' is the title given to the [[chief legal officer]] who handles civil claims against the city in some US municipal and county jurisdictions, including negotiating settlements and defending the city when it is sued. Most corporation counsel do not prosecute criminal cases, but some prosecute traffic and [[local ordinance]] violations. In [[Washington, D.C.]], the former corporation counsel, now known as attorney general, prosecutes [[juvenile delinquency]] cases in addition to traffic and local ordinance violations.

In [[New York City]], the corporation counsel prosecutes juvenile delinquency proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Juvenile Justice in New York City|publisher=Citizens Crime Commission of New York City|date=May 2010|url=http://www.nycrimecommission.org/pdfs/GuideToJuvenileJusticeInNYC.pdf|accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities of New York and [[Chicago]], among others, use this title. Counties in [[Hawaii]] and [[Wisconsin]] have corporation counsel as well.

In some jurisdictions, such as counties in [[Ohio]], the [[prosecutor|county prosecuting attorney]] is, by law, corporation counsel for the county and other governmental entities in the county.

'''Degressive proportionality''' is an approach to the allocation (between regions, states or other subdivisions) of seats in a legislature or other decision-making body. Degressive proportionality means that while the subdivisions do not each elect an equal number of members, smaller subdivisions are allocated more seats than would be allocated strictly in proportion to their population.

This is an alternative to, for instance,

* Each subdivision electing the same number of members (as in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]]),
* Each subdivision electing a number of members strictly proportional to its population (as in the [[US House of Representatives]]).

Degressive proportionality is intermediate between those two approaches. As a term it does not describe any one particular formula.

== Uses ==
=== Germany ===
Each German state has three to six seats in the [[Bundesrat of Germany]] depending on its population. This means the least populous state, Bremen (with 663,000 inhabitants), has three seats while the most populous one, North Rhine-Westphalia (with 18,058,000 inhabitants), has only six seats.

=== European Parliament ===
{{Main|Apportionment in the European Parliament}}
Under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], the [[European Parliament]] uses a system of degressive proportionality to allocate its 750 seats among the member states of the [[European Union]]. Treaty negotiations, rather than a specific formula, determine the apportionment between member states.

== Minimum seats ==
[[File:State population per electoral vote.png|thumb|right|300px|State population per [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. electoral college vote]] for the 50 states and Washington D.C.. States are ranked from left to right based on total population.]]
Any system that reserves a minimum number of seats for a sub-body is to some extent degressively proportional. One example is the election of the [[Electoral College (United States)|US presidential Electoral College]]. As each state has a minimum of three members of the college, voters in smaller states have disproportionally more say in the election than the national average.
Like the US Electoral College, Spain's Congress of Deputies adds two extra seats to the otherwise proportional number allocated to each Province.

== Advantages ==
* There may be a real or perceived danger that one or more of the largest subdivisions will dominate the legislature. That danger reduces if the votes of these subdivisions are reduced.
* The smallest subdivisions, especially those on the periphery of the territory, may have significantly different interests from many of the other subdivisions. There is a danger that these interests will be ignored if they have a tiny number of representatives. That danger reduces if their representation is increased.
* More pragmatically, the smallest subdivisions may be in a position to cause disproportionate trouble for the whole territory, for example by threatening to secede. That danger reduces if they are seen to be well-represented in the legislature.

==Disadvantages==
* Degressive proportionality goes against the basic democratic principle that all votes should count equally.
* Many of the advantages listed above would also apply to certain smaller areas that are ''not'' recognised as separate subdivisions for electoral purposes. (It may have happened as an accident of history or as a result of [[gerrymandering]].) It is unfair if they are not accorded the same treatment as areas that are recognised electorally as separate subdivisions.

== Methods for allocating weights ==
* [[Penrose method]] (square root of the population)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">'''Enhanced Observed Time Difference''' ('''E-OTD''') is a standard for the location of [[mobile telephone]]s. The location method works by [[multilateration]]. The standardisation was first carried out for [[GSM]] by the GSM standard committees (T1P1.5 and ETIS) in LCS Release 98 and Release 99.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/workshop/Archive/0101LCS/Docs/PDF/LCS-010019.pdf “Overview of 2G LCS Technologies and Standards”]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation was continued for [[3G]] and [[WCDMA]] mobile telephones by 3GPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmworld.com/contents/pdf/6623767.pdf “Testing E-ODT” (Manual for the E-ODT compliance check)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, the method is similar to [[U-TDOA]], however, it involves time difference measurements being made in the handset rather than the network, and a mechanism to pseudo-synchronise the network. The handset makes an observation of the time difference of arrival of signals from two different base stations. These observations are known as Observed Time Difference (OTD). The handset measures the OTD between a number of different base stations. If the base stations were synchronised, then a single OTD defines a hyperbolic locus. A second, independent OTD, for which one of the observed base stations is spatially distinct from those in the first OTD, would provide a second hyperbolic locus, and the intersection of the two loci gives an estimate of the location of the mobile. If more than two independent OTDs are available, then the measurements can be combined to yield a more accurate measurement.

However, GSM and 3G networks are not necessarily synchronised, so further information is needed. The E-OTD standard provides a method for pseudo-synchronisation. A Location Measurement Unit (LMU) can be used to estimate the transmission time offset between two base stations. This measurement is known as the Real Time Difference (RTD). The RTD for two base stations can then be subtracted from the OTD for the same two base stations to produce the Geometric Time Difference (GTD). The GTD is the time difference that would have been measured by the mobile if the network was perfectly synchronised. Accordingly, the application of the RTD provides a pseudo-synchronisation.

An LMU is a receiver that is placed in a position in the network that is able to report the RTDs of a number of different base stations. If the base station clocks are not synchronised to a common source, then it is necessary to continuously update the RTDs, as the time offsets will be changing due to the clock drift in each base station.&lt;ref&gt;“Mobile Phone Location Determination and Its Impact on Intelligent Transportation Systems” IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. Vol 1, No. 1, pp 
55 – 64, March, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of LMUs can be expensive, and so is a drawback of E-OTD. However, a 2003 paper&lt;ref&gt;“Mobile location without network-based synchronization or How to do E-OTD without LMUs”. Proc. SPIE. Vol. 5084, 59 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; describes a method of operating E-OTD without LMUs, and presents results of an operational trial. In essence, if there are sufficient independent OTD measurements such that the equation system is over-determined, then the additional information can be used to estimate the RTDs.

E-OTD was considered for the [[Enhanced 911]] mandate, but ultimately was not a successful contender for this application. An active proponent and developer of E-OTD was Cambridge Positioning Systems (CPS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-928153.html “Last Chance for E911 Technology”]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CPS was acquired by [[CSR plc|CSR]]. In 2009, CSR merged with [[CSR plc|SIRF]].

Because E-OTD requires a software modification to be included in the mobile phone, E-OTD positioning system has been less commonly used than the [[U-TDOA]] positioning system.

Zipf earned his bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees from [[Harvard University]], although he also studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt;
He was Chairman of the German Department and University Lecturer (meaning he could teach any subject he chose) at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt; He worked with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[demographics]], and much of his effort can explain properties of the [[Internet]], distribution of income within nations, and many other collections of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Theory of Zipf's Law and Beyond|volume=632|series=Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems|first1=A.

==Zipf's law==
{{Main|Zipf's law}}
He is the [[eponym]] of [[Zipf's law]], which states that while only a few words are used very often, many or most are used rarely,

:&lt;math&gt;P_n \sim 1/n^a&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the frequency of a word ranked ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and the exponent ''a'' is almost 1.  This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf's discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of [[word frequency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Word Frequency Distributions|volume=18|series=Text, Speech and Language Technology|first=R. Harald|last=Baayen|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=9781402009273|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzkQPKoFEb0C&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he originally intended it as a model for linguistics, Zipf later generalized his law to other disciplines. In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book, "National Unity and Disunity" he theorized that breaks in this "normal curve of income distribution" portend social pressure for change or [[revolution]].

A '''Growth Point''' is a technical term in [[cognitive linguistics]] and gesture research. It refers to the earliest beginnings of a spoken [[utterance]] in the mind of a speaker, combining the beginnings of a [[Mimetic theory of speech origins|mimetic gesture]] with the preliminary verbal expression of the person's thought.&lt;ref&gt;D. McNeill, S. Duncan, J. Cole et al. 2008. Growth Points from the Very Beginning. ''Interaction Studies'' '''9''': 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D.1992. '' Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal about Thought.. ''Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|The growth point is the speaker's minimal idea unit that can develop into a full utterance together with a gesture... the content of the growth point tends to be the novel departure of thought from the presupposed background. It is the element of thought that stands out in the context and may be the point of greatest relevance...  The concept of the growth point unites image, word and pragmatic content into a single unit.|{{Citation|title= ''McNeill, D.1992. '' Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal about Thought.

[[File:Makavot-even.jpg|thumb|250px|various hammerstones]]
[[Image:Hard Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a cobble used as a hammerstone]]

In [[archaeology]], a '''hammerstone''' is a hard cobble used to strike off [[lithic flake]]s from a lump of [[tool stone]] during the process of [[lithic reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Joseph Singer, Richard Raper, Trevor Illtyd Williams, ''A History of Technology'', 1954,
Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The hammerstone is a rather universal stone tool which appeared early in most regions of the world including [[Europe]], [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Neelima Dahiya, ''Arts and Crafts in Northern India: From the Earliest Times to C. 200 B.C.'', 1986, D.K. Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North America]].  This technology was of major importance to [[prehistoric]] [[culture]]s before the age of metalworking.

==Materials==
A hammerstone is made of a material such as [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or [[quartzite]], is often [[ovoid]] in shape (to better fit the human hand), and develops telltale [[Impact (mechanics)|battering]] marks on one or both ends.  In archaeological recovery, hammerstones are often found in association with other stone tool artifacts, [[debitage]] and/or objects of the hammer such as [[ore]].&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, ''Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology'', Harvard University, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18353 C. Michael Hogan, ''Los Osos Back Bay'', Megalithic Portal, editor A. Burnham (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern use of hammerstones is now mostly limited to [[flintknapper]]s and others who wish to develop a better understanding of how [[stone tool]]s were made.

==Usage==
Hammerstones are or were used to produce flakes and [[hand axe]]s as well as more specialist tools from materials such as [[flint]] and [[chert]]. They were applied to the edges of such stones so that the [[impact force]]s caused brittle fractures, and loss of flakes for example. They were also widely used to reduce the bulk of other hard stones such as [[jade]], [[jadeite]] and [[hornstone]] to make polished [[stone tool]]s. A good example is the hornstone found in the [[English Lake District]] used to make polished axes during the early [[Neolithic period]], and known as the [[Langdale axe industry]].

Hammerstones were used widely in crushing mineral ores such as [[malachite]] during the [[Chalcolithic]] period, the earliest part of the [[Bronze age]], and [[cassiterite]] prior to smelting of [[tin]]. [[Iron ores]] would have been crushed to powder in a similar way during the [[Iron Age]]. Such crushing was needed to hasten and encourage reduction in the furnaces where [[charcoal]] was the main [[reducing agent]].

Other examples of their use include reducing minerals like [[haematite]] to powder, for [[pigment]], and crushing of hard nuts, such as [[hazel nut]]s, to extract the edible kernels.

'''''Humana.Mente''' – Journal of Philosophical Studies'' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] of [[philosophy]]. Each issue focuses on a specific theme, selected from among critical topics in the contemporary philosophical debate, and is edited by a specialist on the subject, usually an emerging researcher with both philosophical and scientific competence. The [[editor-in-chief]] is Duccio Manetti ([[University of Florence]]). At present, the journal publishes papers in either English or Italian, but it is also open to contributions in French or German.

==Sections==
''Humana.Mente'' is organized in four sections: Papers, Book Reviews, Commentaries, and Interviews. The Papers section intends to create a wide and stimulating reflection on the topics of the issue. Reviews focus on the latest books (dating back not more than 2 years prior to the publication of the issue) that relate to the issue topics. By contrast, the Commentaries section wants to re-open the debate on more "classical" books that deal with the issue topics, and possibly suggest a new perspective to interpret them. Interviews are open dialogs with notable scholars.

'''Humour in translation''' can be caused by translation errors, because of irregularities and discrepancies between certain items that translators attempt to translate. This could be due to the ignorance of the translator, as well as the untranslatability of the text as a result of linguistic or cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alam | first1 = Q.Z. | year = 1989 | title = Humour and Translation: Evidence from Indian English | url = | journal = Translators' Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 72–78 | doi=10.7202/004646ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, translation errors can be caused by the language incompetence of the translator in the target language, resulting in unintended ambiguity in the message conveyed. Translation errors can distort the intended meaning of the author or speaker, to the point of absurdity and ludicrousness, giving a humorous and comedic effect.
Translation errors can cause accidental humour, which is similar to intentional humour. Like intentional humour, accidental humour is also a combination of linguistics and culture-specific features, with humour generating devices (like words and phrases) embedded in it, and is just as competent in conveying humour.

Most translation errors are due to the [[untranslatability]] of the language and the failure of linguistic [[domestication]] and [[foreignization]] processes.  For instance, idiomatic expressions of Chinese like 多多少少 ( [ˈduɔ duɔ ʃaʊ ʃaʊˈ] ) means ‘to an extent’ in English. However, if literally translated, the same phrase can mean ‘many many few few’, losing its original meaning and creating a ludicrous expression of meaning. A case of untranslatability is evident when Coca-Cola first entered the Chinese market in 1928.  Initially there was no official representation of Coca Cola’s name in Mandarin, and random phonetic translation of Coca Cola using random Chinese characters of similar phonetics were used, resulting in the name conveying ridiculous meanings like "female horse fastened with wax" or "bite the wax tadpole" when read. There was hence a need to find four Chinese characters with pronunciations and phonology approximated the sounds "Coca Cola" without producing a nonsensical or adverse meaning when combined into a written phrase. This [[brand blunder]] was eventually solved when the Chinese words [[可口可乐]] were used instead; meaning to be translated as "to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice," but conceptually acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Allman, N.F. (1957).  Transliteration of 'Coca-Cola' Trade-Mark to Chinese Characters. Coca-Cola Overseas, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the combination and translation of words expressed must conform to the target culture and literal [[language interpretation]] or it would result in hilarious misunderstandings. Prime examples of such errors comes in the form of poorly translated sign posts, notices and menus that fails to cater the intended meaning to both foreign and local speakers.

Translation errors have been used widely for commercial and entertainment purposes (intentional humour). A prominent example is the comedy video, "Japanese Titanic" by the YouTube comedy duo, [[Smosh]]. Garnering more than 8.5 million views to date, the farcical video script was produced by translating the original dialogue of the movie ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' into Japanese dialogue via an online translator application, then translating the Japanese dialogue back into English.&lt;ref&gt;SMOSH. (2013, June 28). JAPANESE TITANIC [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2Ai6HAo7Y&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation difficulties ==

Colloquial expressions and conventions in the source language, can cause humour or result in a strange interpretation from the listener or reader in instances when they are not translated into equivalent expressions or conventions in the target language, and instead are translated mechanically or word-for-word.

Difficulties with translation can arise from differences in word order, or from culture-bound expressions, and often also because of the inflexibility of [[machine translation]]. Also, it is due partly to the existence of multiple cultural, linguistic and semantic factors that machine translation often requires the aid of a human translator to convey the intended message of the source text.

Translation difficulties can, therefore, cause translation errors, which can result in humour. A more specific elaboration of various causes of translation errors will be discussed in the following section.

== Translation error types and resultant humour ==
Below are some components of linguistic stimulus theories that attempts to explain the way humour might be derived from translations, as adapted from ''Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English'''&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

External factors like cultural awareness, time considerations, social class and educational considerations, along with internal factors like situation and narrative strategy also plays a big part in the effect of translation on humour.

=== Ambiguity ===
Words that are [[homonym]]ic, paronymic, [[alliterative]] or rhyming, or metalinguistic devices of language can be used to produce humour. Also, wordplay which includes the use of puns, one liners, [[limericks]], witticisms, among various others, can be another way to produce humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zabalbeascoa | first1 = P | year = 2005 | title = Humor and translation - an interdiscipline | url = | journal = Humor-International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 185–207 | doi=10.1515/humr.2005.18.2.185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, these are some funny translations done by machine translators:
* In the office of a doctor in Rome: ''Specialist in women and other diseases''.
* In a Japanese hotel: ''You are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid''.
* In a Norwegian cocktail lounge: ''Ladies are requested not to have children in the bar''.

=== Semantic overlap ===

Humour can result from the interlocutor’s inability to understand [[homonyms]], [[homographs]] or semantically related [[synonym]] words. Similarly, words with superordinate and subordinate relationships are confused.

Overlapping semantics are difficult to distinguish, especially in translation. Words with multiple meanings ([[polysemous]] words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.
Confusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for hyponym, hyponym for superonym, a whole word for a partial word, a partial word for a whole word, antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3615284 | pmid=23675212 | volume=6 | title=Lexis in Chinese-English Translation of Drug Package Inserts: Corpus-based Error Analysis and Its Translation Strategies | year=2010 | journal=Int J Biomed Sci | pages=344–50 | last1 = Ying | first1 = L | last2 = Yumei | first2 = Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of semantic overlap found in a golf course:

"''ANY PERSONS (EXCEPT PLAYERS) CAUGHT COLLECTING GOLF BALLS ON THIS COURSE WILL BE PROSECUTED AND HAVE THEIR BALLS REMOVED''" &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. (2009). Appendix C: English Signage from around the world. In English: the Prototypical World Language for the Twenty First Century (p. 205).&lt;/ref&gt;

The interlocutor's erroneous choice of word ''removed'' instead of ''confiscated'' results in accidental humor in the context as shown in the example above. Semantically, ''removed'' is a commonly used word to express the action ‘take away’ and both are related in terms of sense. ''Removed'' thus may be used as a superordinate form that includes the action of ''taking away''.  The humorous aspect of this situation is intensified with the strong use of word ''removed'' in the phrase ''have their balls removed'', relates to the sexual innuendo of castration instead of the much less extreme action of confiscation. With the overlapping of semantics, the intended message is thus misinterpreted and accidental humor is resulted.

| General Motors first introduced the Chevy Nova in South America. However, it was not aware that "No Va" means "it won't go."

When it finally realised the reason why it was not able to sell any cars, it renamed the car in some of its
Spanish markets to "Chevrolet Chevy".

Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when "the Pinto" flopped. The company
found out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for "tiny male genitals".

Ford then changed all the nameplates, substituting it with "Corcel", meaning "horse".&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, P. M. (n.d.). Translation Funnies. Retrieved from http://www.ojohaven.com/fun/translation.funnies.html#footnote&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Lexico-semantic clusterings can result in paradigmatic errors. It reflects the relations between related words and expressions, which is mainly of paradigmatic relations. The humor above is triggered by the translated text consisting of a script-switch trigger, which then results in the double reading. The irony is not lost in the contexts provided.

In machine translation from Chinese to English the phrase "Fuck the certain price of goods" has become proverbial for absurd machine mistranslations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fuck+the+certain%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b Google search&lt;/ref&gt; That text was on a Chinese / English bilingual sign in a supermarket and should have read "Dry goods department". The [[Simplified Chinese]] character 干 (link: [[干]]) can mean "do" and "dry" and "fuck".

=== Lexical gaps (Pragmatics)===

Lexical gaps concerns words or phrases with no direct translation in any given language.

| Untranslatable words include:
"Scorpie" (Romanian) which refers to a mean and ugly woman.
"Torschlusspanik" (German) which means ‘gate-closing panic’. Though, if you separate the last word into its components, "Torschluss" and "panik", and enter them in almost any translation machine, this will show: "gate closures panic". 
|}

Humor, then, results from the interlocutor's inability to grasp the lexical gaps in target language and linguistic representations may either be over generalised or under generalised to the point of absurdity.

|}

The humour comes from the translator filling in an English lexical gap based on the lexical noun, "miss" by adding a prefix ''mis-''. English employs the two verbs ''miss the carriage'' and ''miscarriages'' to mean vastly different actions. There is a lexical gap in English because the action of ''missing a carriage'' cannot be expressed with the same import and the same economy of verbalisation. The misuse of this lexical gap and overgeneralisation conflates the ludicrous idea of the horse-driven tours with no miscarriages.

|}

From the example above, the interlocutor did not understand English derivations of ‘doer’ nouns such as, ''specialist'', or [[suppletion]] such as, ''experts'' and mistakenly uses the derivational pattern to coin a lexeme from ''method''. Accidental humour ensues as a result of the same word coinciding with the unlikely homophone ''Methodist'', which refers to the Christian religious denomination, creating a ridiculous situation in the context of dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;Gorea, L.

An American slogan for Salem cigarettes was, "Salem - Feeling Free,". When translated for marketing in the Japanese market, it means, "When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty".&lt;ref&gt;Arslan, M., KESİK, C., &amp; KARSAN, A. (2007). A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES ON MNCs WITH ILLUSTRATIVE CASES, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the translator trying to fill in the connotations of the lexical unit "free", perhaps because of limited vocabulary competency and thus resulting in an intralingual error. In this case there are actually Japanese terms equivalent to the adjective, "free" ( e.g. : 自由な).

All being said, languages do have a [[productive (linguistics)]] and recursion property that can also allow words and phrases to combine creatively to fill in the lexical gaps.

For example, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] expressions above can seem nearly impossible to translate. But with the usage of English to translate and establish the context, the meanings of the expression can be derived to be understandable.

=== Morpho-phonological similarity ===

In some cases, incidental humor is produced when interlocutors erroneously uses [[lexeme]]s based on vague morpho-phonological similarity to the target word.

Japan's second-largest tourist agency was rather bewildered when it initially entered English markets and began receiving overwhelming requests for sexual tours. When they finally realized it, Kinki Nippon Tourist Company decided to change its name.&lt;ref&gt;KNT. (2012, August 14).

An interesting and amusing example would be the pronunciation of English words with Chinese translatability by actor Xiao Xiao Bin in the 2010 comedy-martial arts film ''[[Just Call Me Nobody]]'':

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
 (1) [Yes] → 爷死 /ji̯ɛ sɨ/ ‘Grandpa dies’
 (2) [Nice]→ 奶死 /naɪ̯ sɨ/ ‘Grandma dies’
 (3) [Bus] →爸死 /bɑ sɨ/ ‘Dad dies’
 (4) [Knees] →你死 /ni sɨ/ ‘You die’
 (5) [Was]→ 我死 /wu̯ɔ sɨ/‘I die’
 (6) [Does] →都死 /tɤʊ̯ sɨ/ ‘All die’
 (7) [One dollar] → "完蛋了 /wu̯an tan lɯ̯ʌ/ ‘It’s over’
|}

The examples from (1) to (7) illustrates the complete loss of the original meaning of the English words. Though the English pronounced sounds almost phonetically correct, the pronunciation is easily translatable to a Chinese lexeme of a depressing meaning (e.g. : ‘All die’). With the juxtaposition of the intended and accidental meaning with the cheerful [[pragmatics]] of the film, the translation becomes a hilariously erroneous one.

=== Misspelling ===

Misspelled words can be portrayed as the most basic level of inducing unintentional humor that occur in all translations, especially in signs or restaurants' menus. The ability to create humor out of misspelled words in translations happens particularly when the lexical items in a phrase or sentence are very well-known and common to English speakers but in a particular context, the lexical items appears to possess a totally different meaning that could be inappropriate at times.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kharabsheh, A. (2008). Unintentional Humour in the Translation of Jordanian Shop Signs. In Journal of Intercultural Communication, ISSN 1404-1634, 17.

 (1) ''dumplings'' written as ''dumpings'' 
 (2) ''discount'' written as ''discunt''  
 (3) ''coke'' written as ''cock''

 (5) ''shitting'' written as ''shiting''  
 (6) ''pond'' written as ''porn''
 (7) ''lunch'' written as ''launch''  
 (8) ''footwear'' written as ''foodwear'' 
 (9) ''bedsheet'' written as ''bedshit'' 
 (10) ''tested'' written as ''tasted'' in a hospital's sign "''diagnostic for blood, urine, semen, stool and pregnancy, etc are tasted here''." 
|}

All these examples clearly show how inadvertent spelling of words can give rise to humorous transcriptions to anyone who possess a fair flair of English. In examples (4-6, 8, 9), ‘crap’, ‘shiting’, ‘porn’, ‘food’, ‘shit’ were blatantly misspelled by the translators in a way that they all share the same phonological but a complete different semantics form of another already existing pejorative word in English; ‘crab’, ‘shitting’, ‘pond’, ‘foot’ and ‘sheet’ respectively. Thus, all these examples produce unexpected smutty farce-comedy for readers, where humour seeps in as a natural corollary of this linguistic coincidence. Innocuous as the spelling mistakes may seem, the examples above (1-3, 7, 10) were also misspelled to other words that have a total different meanings as the intended words. ‘Dumping’ means the act of removing waste or garbage and it was associated with a food - ‘dumplings’. Likewise, ‘footwear’, which is worn on your foot, is written as ‘food-wear’. Additionally, ‘discount’ is written as ‘dis-cunt’ whereby cunt is an obscene word. Lastly, ‘tested’ and ‘tasted’ have a complete distinct meanings. ‘Tested’ means to identify or characterize a substance or constituents whereas ‘tasted’ means to sense the flavor of something. Thus in the case of example 10, humour not only springs from the misspelled word ‘tasted’ but is also accidentally heightened by the existence of the phrase ‘diagnostic for blood, urine, semain, stool and pregnancy’, which creates a state of intolerable linguistic redundancy. Hence, in these ways, misspelling can give a tantalising feeling of amusement to readers.&lt;ref&gt;Nashrulla, T. (2013). 29 Spelling Mistakes From India That Will Make You Laugh, Cry and Gag. In Buzzfeed.com. Retrieved from https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/29-spelling-mistakes-from-india-that-will-make-you-laugh-cry#8h0ge6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== References ===

Using the wrong reference may change the translator's intended meaning and led to multiple comical interpretations for the readers, thus, producing various humorous scripts. 
For example,

(1) A sign in a Chinese Safari Park states "大象在此 请留在车上 Elephants Here Please Stay In Your Car"

The translator intended to refer the general public that are visiting the park as the implicit reference marker of the sign by using the co-referential anaphor 'Your', but failed to do so and instead, the explicit anaphor 'Your' unintentionally picks up 'Elephants' as the textual referent. Thus, this give rise to a humorous script that looks as though that the sign is meant for the elephants and not the people. In addition, this example highlights the importance of having punctuation to serve as a cohesion device because if the translator were to put a full stop or exclamation point after the word 'Elephants', the anaphor 'your' would have been interpreted literally for the readers. Therefore, it would have also ruled out any possibilities of humorous reading.

(2) An article in Soviet Weekly reports "There will be a Moscow Exhibition of Arts by 15,000 Soviet Republic painters and sculptors. These were executed over the past two years."

Similarly, there is a mishap of the anaphoric reference marker 'these', which to the interpretation of readers, refers to 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Hence, this script lacks of an eligible textual referent to accurately bring across the intended message. Although this script is easily decipherable based upon one's basic knowledge, it still did not fail to cause laughter and humor to readers.&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word order ===

Word order is the way in which syntactic constituents of a language arrange itself in a phrase or a sentence. Different languages employ different structures of word order. Direct translation of one language to another may result in wrong placement of a phrase in relation to the other constituents in the sentence. This may cause a change to the initial meaning of the translator and hence, may trigger a humorous script.

| A sign in the lobby of a Moscow hotel across a Russian Orthodox monastery states "Вы можете посетить кладбище, где известные российские и советские композиторы, художники и писатели похоронены ежедневно, кроме четверга. You are welcome to visit the cemetery where famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers are buried daily except Thursday."
|}

Because of to the incorrect placement of the adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ at the end of the sentence, this script generates unintentional humor in its translation. The adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ became a post-modifier which had misguided the readers into thinking that the script is about the act of burying ‘famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers’, instead of conveying the act of people visiting the cemetery. Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.

{| class="wikitable"

| A menu in a Tokyo bar shows, "Special cocktails for the ladies with nuts"
|}

Likewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase ‘with nuts’ as a post-modifier of ‘the ladies’ instead of its intended referent ‘cocktails’ as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to "Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word ‘nuts’. Thus, if the word ‘nuts’ were to be replaced with ‘cashews’, any humorous translation error would not have been present. Therefore, it should be noted that attachment sites of prepositional phrases are a notorious source of ambiguity in English.&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Interface of Weasel Input Method.png|thumb|Operation of a Chinese [[Pinyin]]-based IME]]

An '''input method''' (or '''input method editor''', commonly abbreviated '''IME''') is an [[operating system]] component or program that allows any data, such as keyboard strokes or mouse movements, to be received as input. In this way users can enter characters and symbols not found on their [[input device]]s. Using an input method is obligatory for any language that has more [[grapheme]]s than there are keys on the keyboard.

For instance, on the computer, this allows the user of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[Keyboard layout|keyboards]] to input [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], [[Hangul|Korean]] and [[Indic script|Indic]] characters; on many hand-held devices, such as mobile phones, it enables using the [[telephone keypad|numeric keypad]] to enter [[Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet characters]] (or any other alphabet characters) or a screen display to be touched to do so. On some operating systems, an input method is also used to define the behaviour of the [[dead key]]s.

==Implementations==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
Although originally coined for [[CJK]] (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) computing, the term is now sometimes used generically to refer to a program to support the input of any language. To illustrate, in the [[X Window System]], the facility to allow the input of [[Latin character]]s with [[diacritic]]s is also called an input method.

On [[Windows XP]] or later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], Input method, or IME, are also called ''Text Input Processor'', which are implemented by the [[Text Services Framework]] API.

==Relationship between the methodology and implementation==
While the term ''input method editor'' was originally used for [[Microsoft Windows#Multilingual support: IMEs and LIPs|Microsoft Windows]], its use has now gained acceptance in other operating systems{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}, especially when it is important to distinguish between the [[Interface (computer science)|computer interface]] and implementation of input methods, or among the input methods themselves, the editing functionality of the program or operating system component providing the input method, and the general support of input methods in an operating system. This term has, for example, gained general acceptance on the GNU/Linux operating system; it is also used on the Mac OS.
*The term ''input method'' generally refers to a particular way to use the keyboard to input a particular language, for example the [[Cangjie method]], the [[pinyin method]], or the use of [[dead key]]s.
*On the other hand, the term ''input method editor'' on Microsoft products refers to the actual program that allows an input method to be used (for example MS New Pinyin). [[Predictive Input Method|PRIME]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} or [[Smart Common Input Method|SCIM]] prefer the term of ''Input Method Engine'', ''Input Method platform'' or ''Input Method environment'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} or the actual ''editing area'' that allows the user to do the input. It can also &lt;!-- apparently --&gt; refer to a character palette, which allows any Unicode character to be input individually. One might also interpret IME to refer to the editor used for creating or modifying the data files upon which an input method relies.

{{Nihongo|'''''Kofun'''''|古墳|4=from [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] "ancient grave"}} are megalithic [[tomb]]s or [[tumulus|tumuli]] in [[Japan]], constructed between the early 3rd century and the early 7th century AD.

The [[Mozu kofungun|Mozu]]-[[Furuichi kofungun|Furuichi]] kofungun or tumulus clusters have been proposed for inscription on the [[World Heritage Sites in Japan|UNESCO World Heritage List]], while [[Ishibutai Kofun]] is one of a number in [[Asuka-Fujiwara]] similarly residing on the [[World Heritage Sites in Japan#Tentative List|Tentative List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5570/ |title=Mozu-Furuichi Kofungun, Ancient Tumulus Clusters |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5097/ |title=Asuka-Fujiwara: Archaeological sites of Japan’s Ancient Capitals and Related Properties |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The kofun tumuli have assumed various shapes throughout history. The most common type of kofun is known as a {{nihongo|''zenpō-kōen-fun''|前方後円墳}}, which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. There are also circular-type ({{nihongo|''empun''|円墳}}), "two conjoined rectangles" typed ({{nihongo|''zenpō-kōhō-fun''|前方後方墳}}), and square-type ({{nihongo|''hōfun''|方墳}}) kofun. Orientation of kofun is not specified. For example, in the Saki Kofun group, all of the circular parts are facing north, but there is no such formation in the Yanagimoto kofun group. [[Haniwa]], [[terracotta]] figures, were arrayed above and in the surroundings to delimit and protect the sacred areas.

Kofun range from several meters to over 400m long. The largest, which has been attributed to [[Emperor Nintoku]], is [[Daisen Kofun]] in [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture]].

The funeral chamber was located beneath the round part and comprised a group of megaliths. In 1972, the unlooted [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] was found in [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]], and some details of the discovery were revealed. Inside the tightly assembled rocks, white [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] plasters were pasted,  and colored pictures depict the 'Asuka Beauties' of the court as well as constellations. A stone coffin was placed in the chamber, and accessories, swords, and bronze mirrors were laid both inside and outside the coffin. The wall paintings have been designated [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|national treasures]] and the grave goods as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|important cultural property]], while the tumulus is a [[List of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments|special historic site]].&lt;ref name="Agency for Cultural Affairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=401&amp;item_id=2020 |title=Database of National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agency for Cultural Affairs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=9951 |title=Database of National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations and number===

Kofun [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] and their remains have been found all over Japan, including remote islands such as [[Nishinoshima (Shimane)|Nishinoshima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iseki.ipc.shimane-u.ac.jp/search.php?&amp;search_kbn=city&amp;sitecitycode%5B%5D=58&amp;target=site&amp;order_item=siteshimpsiteno 島根県遺跡データベース　Archaeological Database of Shimane（Japanese）]&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 161,560 kofun tomb sites have been found as of 2001. [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] has the most of all prefectures (16,577 sites), and [[Chiba Prefecture]] has the second most (13,112 sites).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~shabun-bo/gyouseisituhp/top/kihonkousou/6(4).pdf 兵庫県教育委員会 兵庫県の遺跡・遺物数の全国的な位置（pdf file, Japanese）]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IshibutaiWithFigureSmallVersion2.jpg|thumb|The stone chamber of [[Ishibutai Kofun]], said to be the tomb of [[Soga no Umako]], [[Asuka-Fujiwara|Asuka]], [[Nara Prefecture]] (7th century)]]

===Yayoi period===
Most of the tombs of chiefs in the [[Yayoi period]] were square-shaped mounds surrounded by ditches. The most notable example in the late Yayoi period is Tatetsuki Mound Tomb in [[Kurashiki, Okayama]]. The mound is about 45 meters wide and 5 meters high and has a shaft chamber. Broken pieces of ''Tokushu-kidai'', cylindrical earthenware, were excavated around the mound.

Another prevalent type of Yayoi period tomb is the ''Yosumi tosshutsugata funkyūbo'', a square mound with protruding corners. These tombs were built in the [[San'in region]], a coastal area off the Sea of Japan. Unearthed articles indicate the existence of alliances between native tribes in the region.

===Early Kofun period===
One of the first keyhole-shaped kofun was built in the {{illm|Makimuku|ja|纒向型前方後円墳}} area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/1654|title=たわらもと2013発掘速報展|last=Krako-kagi Archaeological Museum|first=|date=2013|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southeastern part of the Nara Basin. {{illm|Hashihaka Kofun|ja|箸墓古墳}}, which was built in the middle of the 3rd century AD, is 280 meters long and 30 meters high. Its scale is obviously different from previous Yayoi tombs. During the next three decades, about 10 kofun were built in the area, which are now called as the ''Makimuku Kofun Group''. A wooden coffin was placed on the bottom of a shaft, and the surrounding walls were built up by flat stones. Finally, megalithic stones formed the roof. [[Bronze mirrors]], iron swords, [[magatama]], clay vessels and other artifacts were found in good condition in undisturbed tombs. Some scholars assume the buried person of ''Hashihaka kofun'' was the shadowy ancient Queen [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]], mentioned in the Chinese historical texts. According to the books, Japan was called [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], which was the confederation of numerous small tribes or countries. The construction of gigantic kofun is the result of the relatively centralized governmental structure in the Nara Basin, possibly the origin of the Yamato polity and the Imperial lineage of Japan.

===Mid-Kofun period===
During the 5th century AD, the construction of keyhole kofun began in [[Yamato Province]]; continued in Kawachi, where gigantic kofun, such as Daisen Kofun of the Emperor Nintoku, were built; and then throughout the country (except for the [[Tōhoku region]]). 
The proliferation of keyhole kofun is generally assumed to be evidence of the Yamato court's expansion in this age. However, some argue that it simply shows the spreading of culture based on progress in distribution, and has little to do with a political breakthrough. In recent years, South Korea has begun to allocate more resources toward archaeology, and keyhole tombs have been found around the Yeongsan River basin, during the mid-Baekje Era. The keyhole tombs that have thus far been discovered on the Korean peninsula, were built between the 5th and the 6th centuries AD.&lt;ref name="yoshii"&gt;Yoshii, Hideo (Kyoto University). [http://www.international.ucla.edu/korea/pdfs/YoshiiPaperFinal.pdf "Keyhole-shaped tombs in Korean Peninsula"].&lt;/ref&gt; There remains question over whether the tombs were made for Japanese aristocrats loyal to Baekje, Japanese merchants who controlled the region, or a class independent from both Baekje and Yamato Japan.&lt;ref name="yoshii"/&gt;

Keyhole-shaped kofun disappeared in the late 6th century AD, probably due to the drastic reformation in the Yamato court, where ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' records the introduction of [[Buddhism]] during this era.

'''Ksar Akil''' is an archeological site {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Beirut]] in [[Lebanon]]. It is located about {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} west of Antelias spring on the north bank of the northern tributary of the Wadi Antelias. It is a large rock shelter below a steep [[limestone]] cliff.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/inventory-of-stone-age-sites-in-lebanon-1-west-central-lebanon/oclc/917417205&amp;referer=brief_results|title = Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 100-101|publisher = Imprimerie Catholique|year = 1965|author1 = Lorraine Copeland|author2 = P. Wescombe|accessdate = 6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first noticed by [[Godefroy Zumoffen]] in 1900&lt;ref&gt;Zumoffen, G., La Phénicie avant les Phéniciens, Imprimerie Catholique, Beirut, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; and first studied by A. E. Day in 1926&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.E., The Rock Shelter of Ksar Akil near the Cave of Antilias, Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; then first systematically excavated by J.G. Doherty, S.J., and J.F. Ewing, S.J., in 1937-1938 and again in 1947-1948, then later by [[Jacques Tixier]] in 1969-1975 before research was interrupted by the [[Lebanese Civil War]].

Excavations showed occupational deposits reaching down to a depth of {{convert|23.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} with one of the longest sequences of [[Paleolithic]] [[flint]] [[archaeological industry|industries]] ever found in the [[Middle East]]. The first level of {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} contained Upper [[Levalloiso-Mousterian]] remains with long and triangular [[Lithic flake]]s. The level above this showed industries accounting for all six stages of the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. An [[Emireh point]] was found at the first stage of this level (XXIV), at around {{convert|15.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} below datum with a complete [[skeleton]] of an eight-year-old ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (called [[Egbert (disambiguation)|Egbert]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, now in the [[National Museum of Beirut]] after being studied in [[United States|America]]) was discovered at {{convert|11.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, cemented into [[breccia]]. A fragment of a [[Neanderthal]] [[maxilla]] was also discovered in material from level XXVI or XXV, at around {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Studies by Hooijer showed [[Capra (genus)|Capra]] and [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] were dominant in the [[fauna]] along with [[Stephanorhinus]] in later Levalloiso-Mousterian levels.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

It is assumed to be one of the earliest known sites containing [[Upper Paleolithic]] technologies including [[Aurignacian]] cultural objects. Artifacts recovered from the site include [[Ksar Akil flake]]s, the main type of tool found at the site, along with pierced shells and chipped edge modifications that suggest these have been used as pendants or beads. This indicates that the inhabitants were among the first in Western Eurasia to use personal ornaments. Results from radiocarbon dating indicate that the early humans may have lived at the site approximately 45,000 years ago or earlier. The presence of  personal ornaments at Ksar Akil is suggestive of [[modern human behavior]]. The findings of ornaments at the site are contemporaneous with ornaments found at [[Late Stone Age]] sites such as [[Enkapune ya muto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Ornaments of the earliest Upper Paleolithic: New insights from the Levant|year=2001|doi=10.1073/pnas.121590798|last=Kuhn|first=Steven |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |pages=7641–6 |pmid=11390976 |last2=Stiner |first2=MC |last3=Reese |first3=DS |last4=Güleç |first4=E |issue=13 |pmc=34721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://oxford.academia.edu/KaterinaDouka/Papers/372932/Douka_K._2011._An_Upper_Palaeolithic_shell_scraper_from_Ksar_Akil_Lebanon_._Journal_of_Archaeological_Science_38_2_429-437 Douka, K. 2011.

Harpending, PNAS, June 5th 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was rescued from burial under the [[sludge]] of [[gravel]]-making machines in 1964 by the Department of Antiquities, although is mostly unrecognizable due to quarrying operations with its talus buried under tons of soil.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

'''Kumari Kandam''' ({{lang-ta|குமரிக்கண்டம்}}) refers to a mythical&lt;ref name="Bane2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theresa Bane|title=Encyclopedia of Imaginary and Mythical Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKwzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date=4 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1565-3|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost continent with an ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] civilization, located south of present-day India, in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Alternative name and spellings include ''Kumarikkantam'' and ''Kumari Nadu''.

In the 19th century, a section of the European and American scholars speculated the existence of a submerged continent called [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], to explain geological and other similarities between [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and [[Madagascar]]. A section of [[Tamil Renaissance|Tamil revivalists]] adapted this theory, connecting it to the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan]] legends of lands lost to the ocean, as described in ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] literature. According to these writers, an ancient Tamil civilization existed on Lemuria, before it was lost to the sea in a catastrophe. In the 20th century, the Tamil writers started using the name "Kumari Kandam" to describe this submerged continent. Although the Lemuria theory was later rendered obsolete by the [[continental drift]] ([[plate tectonics]]) theory, the concept remained popular among the Tamil revivalists of the 20th century. According to them, Kumari Kandam was the place where the first two Tamil literary academies ([[Tamil Sangams|sangams]]) were organized during the Pandyan reign. They claimed Kumari Kandam as the [[cradle of civilization]] to prove the antiquity of [[Tamil language]] and [[Tamil culture|culture]].

== Etymology and names ==

After the Tamil writers were introduced to the concept of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] in the 1890s, they came up with the Tamilized versions of the continent's name (e.g.  "Ilemuria"). By the early 1900s, they started using Tamil names for the continent, to support their depiction of Lemuria as an ancient Tamil civilization. In 1903, [[Parithimar Kalaignar|V.G. Suryanarayana Sastri]] first used the term "Kumarinatu" (or "Kumari Nadu", meaning "Kumari territory") in his work ''Tamil Mozhiyin Varalaru'' (History of the Tamil language). The term Kumari Kandam ("Kumari continent") was first used to describe Lemuria in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=104–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "Kumari Kandam" first appear in ''Kanda Puranam'', a 15th-century Tamil version of the [[Skanda Purana]], written by Kachiappa Sivacharyara (1350-1420).&lt;ref name="Richard2009"/&gt; Although the Tamil revivalists insist that it is a pure Tamil name, it is actually a derivative of the Sanskrit word "Kumārika Khaṇḍa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Andakosappadalam'' section of ''Kanda Puranam'' describes the following [[Hindu cosmology|cosmological model]] of the universe: There are many [[loka|worlds]], each having several continents, which in turn, have several kingdoms. Paratan, the ruler of one such kingdom, had eight sons and one daughter. He further divided his kingdom into nine parts, and the part ruled by his daughter Kumari came to be known as Kumari Kandam after her. Kumari Kandam is described as ''the'' kingdom of the Earth. Although the Kumari Kandam theory became popular among [[Anti-Brahminism|anti-Brahmin]] anti-[[Sanskrit]] Tamil nationalists, the ''Kanda Puranam'' actually describes Kumari Kandam as the land where the [[Brahmin]]s reside, where [[Shiva]] is worshipped and where the [[Vedas]] are recited. The rest of the kingdoms are described as the territory of the [[mleccha]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Orientalist: A Journal of Oriental Literature, Arts, and Sciences Folklore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2E-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA101 |year=1884 |publisher=[[Trübner &amp; Co]] |chapter=Curiosities of Tamil Literature |author=C. Brito |pages=98–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century Tamil writers came up with various theories to explain the etymology of "Kumari Kandam" or "Kumari Nadu". One set of claims was centered on the purported [[gender egalitarianism]] in the prelapsarian Tamil homeland. For example, M. Arunachalam (1944) claimed that the land was ruled by female rulers (''Kumari''s). D. Savariroyan Pillai stated that the women of the land had the right to choose their husbands and owned all the property, because of which the land came to be known as "Kumari Nadu" ("the land of the maiden"). Yet another set of claims was centered on the Hindu goddess [[Devi Kanya Kumari|Kanya Kumari]]. Kandiah Pillai, in a book for children, fashioned a new history for the goddess, stating that the land was named after her. He claimed that the temple at [[Kanyakumari]] was established by those who survived the flood that submerged Kumari Kandam. According to cultural historian Sumathi Ramaswamy, the emphasis of the Tamil writers on the word "Kumari" (meaning virgin or maiden) symbolizes the purity of Tamil language and culture, before their contacts with the other ethnic groups such as the [[Indo-Aryans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamil writers also came up with several other names for the lost continent. In 1912, Somasundara Bharati first used the word "Tamilakam" (a name for the [[ancient Tamil country]]) to cover the concept of Lemuria, presenting it as the [[cradle of civilization]], in his ''Tamil Classics and Tamilakam''. Another name used was "Pantiya natu", after the [[Pandyas]], regarded as the oldest of the Tamil dynasties. Some writers used "Navalan Tivu" (or Navalam Island), the Tamil name of [[Jambudvipa]], to describe the submerged land.&lt;ref name="Sumathi204-211"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submerged lands in ancient Indian literature ==

Multiple ancient and medieval Tamil and Sanskrit works contain legendary accounts of lands in [[South India]] being lost to the ocean. The earliest explicit discussion of a ''katalkol'' ("seizure by ocean", possibly [[tsunami]]) of Pandyan land is found in a commentary on ''[[Iraiyanar Akapporul]]''. This commentary, attributed to [[Nakkeerar]], is dated to the later centuries of the 1st millennium CE. It mentions that the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]] kings, an early Tamil dynasty, established three literary academies (''[[Tamil Sangams|Sangams]]''): the first Sangam flourished for 4,400 years in a city called Tenmaturai (South Madurai) attended by 549 poets (including [[Agastya]]) and presided over by gods like [[Shiva]], [[Kubera]] and [[Murugan]]. The second Sangam lasted for 3,700 years in a city called Kapatapuram, attended by 59 poets (including Agastya, again). The commentary states that both the cities were "seized by the ocean", resulting in loss of all the works created during the first two Sangams. The third Sangam was established in ''Uttara'' (North) [[Madurai]], where it is said to have lasted for 1,850 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William P. Harman |title=The Sacred Marriage of a Hindu Goddess |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_siW9T3ev4C&amp;pg=PA39 |year=1992 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-0810-2 |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shulman|1980|pp=55-56}}&lt;ref name="Sumathi143-145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakkeerar's commentary does not mention the size of the territory lost to the sea. The size is first mentioned in a 15th-century commentary on [[Silappatikaram]]. The commentator Adiyarkunallar mentions that the lost land extended from [[Pahruli]] river in the north to the Kumari river in the South. It was located to the south of [[Kanyakumari]], and covered an area of 700 ''kavatam'' (a unit of unknown measurement). It was divided into 49 territories (''natu''), classified in the following seven categories:&lt;ref name="Sumathi143-145"/&gt;

* Elu teñku natu ("Seven coconut lands")
* Elu Maturai natu ("Seven mango lands")
* Elu munpalai natu ("Seven front sandy lands")
* Elu pinpalai natu ("Seven back sandy lands")
* Elu kunra natu ("Seven hilly lands")
* Elu kunakarai natu ("Seven coastal lands")
* Elu kurumpanai natu ("Seven dwarf-palm lands")

Other medieval writers, such as Ilampuranar and Perasiriyar, also make stray references to the loss of antediluvian lands to the south of Kanyakumari, in their commentaries on ancient texts like ''[[Tolkappiyam]]''. Another legend about the loss of Pandyan territory to the sea is found in scattered verses of ''[[Purananuru]]'' (dated between 1st century BCE and 5th century CE) and ''[[Kaliththokai]]'' (6th-7th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Kalittokai 104:1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purananuru 6:1–2, 17:1, 67:6.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this account, the Pandyan king compensated the loss of his land by seizing an equivalent amount of land from the neighboring kingdoms of [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] and [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]].

There are also several other ancient accounts of non-Pandyan land lost to the sea. Many [[Hinduism in Tamil Nadu|Tamil Hindu]] shrines have legendary accounts of surviving the floods mentioned in Hindu mythology. These include the prominent temples of [[Kanyakumari]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madurai]], [[Sirkazhi]] and [[Tiruvottiyur]].{{sfn|Shulman|1980|pp=57-69}} There are also legends of temples submerged under the sea, such as the [[Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram]]. The [[Puranas]] place the beginning of the most popular Hindu [[flood myth]] - the legend of [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] - in South India. The Sanskrit-language ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (dated 500 BCE-1000 CE) describes its protagonist Manu (aka Satyavrata) as the Lord of [[Dravida Kingdom|Dravida]] (South India). The ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' (dated 250–500 CE) also begins with Manu practicing ''[[tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'' on [[Malaya Mountains|Mount Malaya]] of South India.{{sfn|Shulman|1980|p=57}} ''Manimeghalai'' (dated around 6th century CE) mentions that the ancient Chola port city of Kaverippumpattinam (present-day [[Puhar]]) was destroyed by a flood. It states that this flood was sent by the Hindu deity [[Indra]], because the king forgot to celebrate a festival dedicated to him.{{sfn|Shulman|1980|p=62}}

None of these ancient texts or their medieval commentaries use the name "Kumari Kandam" or "Kumari Nadu" for the land purportedly lost to the sea. They do not state that the land lost by the sea was a whole continent located to the south of Kanyakumari. Nor do they link the loss of this land to the history of Tamil people as a community.&lt;ref name="Sumathi143-145"/&gt;

== Lemuria hypothesis in India ==

In 1864, the English zoologist [[Philip Sclater]] hypothesized the existence of a submerged land connection between India, Madagascar and continental Africa. He named this submerged land [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], as the concept had its origins in his attempts to explain the presence of [[lemur]]-like primates ([[strepsirrhini]]) on these three disconnected lands. Before the Lemuria hypothesis was rendered obsolete by the [[continental drift]] theory, a number of scholars supported and expanded it. The concept was introduced to the Indian readers in an 1873 physical geography textbook by [[Henry Francis Blanford]]. According to Blanford, the landmass had submerged due to volcanic activity during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry1873"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry Francis Blanford |title=The Rudiments of Physical Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHMmAAAAMAAJ |year=1874 |origyear=1873 |publisher=Thacker, Spink |pages=119–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1870s, the Lemuria theory found its first proponents in the present-day Tamil Nadu, when the leaders of the [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]]-headquartered [[Theosophical Society]] wrote about it (see the [[root race]] theory).&lt;ref name="Richard2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most European and American geologists dated Lemuria's disappearance to a period before the emergence of [[anatomically modern humans|modern humans]]. Thus, according to them, Lemuria could not have hosted an ancient civilization. However, in 1885, the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] officer Charles D. Maclean published ''The Manual of the Administration of the Madras Presidency'', in which he theorized Lemuria as the [[proto-Dravidian]] [[urheimat]]. In a footnote in this work, he mentioned [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[Out of Asia theory|Asia hypothesis]], which theorized that the humans originated in a land now submerged in the Indian Ocean. Maclean added that this submerged land was the homeland of the proto-Dravidians. He also suggested that the progenitors of the other races must have migrated from Lemuria to other places via South India. This theory was also cursorily discussed by other colonial officials like [[Edgar Thurston]] and [[Herbert Hope Risley]], including in the [[Census of India|census]] reports of 1891 and 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Maclean's manual came to be cited as an authoritative work by the Tamil writers, who often wrongly referred to him as a "scientist" and a "Doctor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Tamil intellectuals first started discussing the concept of a submerged Tamil homeland in the late 1890s. In 1898, J. Nallasami Pillai published an article in the philosophical-literary journal ''Siddhanta Deepika'' (aka ''The Truth of Light''). He wrote about the theory of a lost continent in the Indian Ocean (i.e. Lemuria), mentioning that the Tamil legends speak of floods which destroyed the literary works produced during the ancient sangams. However, he also added that this theory had "no serious historical or scientific footing".&lt;ref&gt;Nallasami Pillai, J. 1898. Ancient Tamil Civilization. The Light of Truth or Siddhanta Deepika 2, no. 5: 109–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popularization in Tamil Nadu ===

In the 1920s, the Lemuria concept was popularized by the [[Tamil Renaissance|Tamil revivalists]] to counter the dominance of [[Indo-Aryans]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="SChris2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2808/stories/20110422280809000.htm |title=The Lemuria myth |author=S. Christopher Jayakaran |journal=Frontline |volume=28 |issue=8 |date=9–22 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil revivalist writers claimed that Lemuria, prior to its deluge, was the original Tamil homeland and birthplace of Tamil civilization. They often misquoted or miscited the words of Western scholars to grant credibility to their assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the British era, the loss of small patches of lands to [[cyclone]]s was catalogued in several district reports, gazetteers and other documents. The Tamil writers of the period cited these as evidence supporting the theory about an ancient land lost to the sea.&lt;ref name="Sumathi143-145"/&gt;

==== In curriculum ====

The books discussing the Kumari Kandam theory were first included in college curriculum of the present-day Tamil Nadu in 1908. Suryanarayana Sastri's book was prescribed for use in [[Madras University]]'s Master's degree courses in 1908-09. Over the next few decades, other such works were also included in the curriculum of Madras University and [[Annamalai University]]. These include Purnalingam Pillai's ''A Primer of Tamil Literature'' (1904) and ''Tamil literature'' (1929), Kandiah Pillai's ''Tamilakam'' (1934), and Srinivasa Pillai's ''Tamil Varalaru'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1940 Tamil language textbook for ninth-grade students, [[Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram|T. V. Kalyanasundaram]] wrote that Lemuria of the European scholars was Kumarinatu of the Tamil literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Dravidian parties]] came to power in the [[Madras State Legislative Assembly election, 1967|1967 Madras State elections]], the Kumari Kandam theory was disseminated more widely through school and college textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the Government of Tamil Nadu established a formal committee to write the history of ''Tamilakam'' (ancient Tamil territory). The state education minister R. Nedunceliyan declared in the Legislative Assembly that by "history", he meant "from the time of Lemuria that was seized by the ocean".&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy 2004 151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Debates 24 (1972): 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Government of Tamil Nadu constituted a committee of historians and litterateurs, headed by [[Mu. Varadarajan|M. Varadarajan]]. One of the objectives of the committee was to highlight "the great antiquity" of the Tamils. A 1975 textbook written by this committee detailed the Kumari Kandam theory, stating that it was supported by "the foremost geologists, ethnologists and anthropologists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1981, the Tamil Nadu government's history textbooks mentioned the Kumari Kandam theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil language school textbooks in the state government's "Samacheer"(uniform) syllabus still mention the Lemuria - Kumari Kandam theory.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Characteristics ==
The Tamil writers characterized Kumari Kandam as an ancient, but highly advanced civilization located in an isolated continent in the Indian Ocean. They also described it as the [[cradle of civilization]] inhabited solely by the speakers of Tamil language. The following sections describe these characteristics in detail.

=== Isolated ===

Kumari Kandam is theorized as an isolated (both temporally and geographically) land mass. Geographically, it was located in the Indian Ocean. Temporally, it was a very ancient civilization.  Many Tamil writers do not assign any date to the submergence of Kumari Kandam, resorting to phrases like "once upon a time" or "several thousands of years ago". Those who do, vary greatly, ranging from 30,000 BCE to the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other writers state that the land was progressively lost to the over a period of thousands of years. In 1991, R. Mathivanan, then Chief Editor of the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project of the Government of Tamil Nadu, claimed that the Kumari Kandam civilization flourished around 50,000 BCE, and the continent submerged around 16,000 BCE. This theory was based on the methodology recommended by his teacher [[Devaneya Pavanar]].

The isolation resulted in the possibility of describing Kumari Kandam as a utopian society insulated from external influences and foreign corruption. Unlike its description in the Kanda Puranam, the Tamil revivalists depicted Kumari Kandam as a place free of the upper-caste [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmins]], who had come to be identified as descendants of Indo-Aryans during the [[Dravidian movement]]. The non-utopian practices of the 20th century Tamil Hindu society, such as [[superstition in India|superstitions]] and [[caste system in India|caste]]-based discrimination, were all described as corruption resulting from Indo-Aryan influence.&lt;ref name="Richard2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard S. Weiss |title=Recipes for Immortality : Healing, Religion, and Community in South India: Healing, Religion, and Community in South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ges6XgLkffEC&amp;pg=PA89 |date=22 January 2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971500-8 |pages=89–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A land lost to the ocean also helped the Tamil revivalists provide an explanation for the lack of historically verifiable or scientifically acceptable material evidence about this ancient civilization. The earliest extant Tamil writings, which are attributed to the third Sangam, contain Sanskrit vocabulary, and thus could not have been the creation of a purely Tamil civilization. Connecting the concept of Lemuria to an ancient Tamil civilization allowed the Tamil revivalists to portray a society completely free of Indo-Aryan influence.&lt;ref name="Richard2009"/&gt; They could claim that the various signs of the ancient Tamil civilization had been lost in the deep ocean. The later dominance of Sanskrit was offered as another explanation for the deliberate destruction of ancient Tamil works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, R. Nedunceliyan, who later became Tamil Nadu's education minister, published a pamphlet called ''Marainta Tiravitam'' ("Lost Dravidian land"). He insisted that the Brahmin historians, being biased towards Sanskrit, had deliberately kept the knowledge of the Tamil's greatness hidden from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connected with South India ===

The Kumari Kandam proponents laid great emphasis on stating that the [[Kanyakumari]] city was a part of the original Kumari Kandam. Some of them also argued that entire [[Tamil Nadu]], entire [[Indian peninsula]] (south of [[Vindhya range|Vindhyas]]) or even entire India were a part of Kumari Kandam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped ensure that the modern Tamils could be described as both indigenous people of South India and the direct descendants of the people of Kumari Kandam. This, in turn, allowed them to describe the Tamil language and culture as the world's oldest.&lt;ref name="Sumathi-109-113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=109–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[British Raj]], Kanyakumari was a part of the [[Travancore]] state, most of which was merged to the newly-formed [[Kerala]] state after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|1956 reorganization]]. The Tamil politicians made a concerted effort to ensure that Kanyakumari was incorporated into the Tamil-majority [[Madras State]] (now [[Tamil Nadu]]). Kanyakumari's purported connection with Kumari Kandam was one of the reasons for this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cradle of civilization ===

According to the Kumari Kandam proponents, the continent was submerged when the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] ended and the sea levels rose. The Tamil people then migrated to other lands, and mixed with the other groups, leading to the formation of new races, languages and civilizations. Some also theorize that the entire humanity is descended from the inhabitants of Kumari Kandam. Both narratives agree on the point that the Tamil culture is the source of all civilized culture in the world, and Tamil is the mother language of all other languages in the world. According to the most versions, the original culture of Kumari Kandam survived in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Richard2009"/&gt;

As early as 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri, in his ''Tamilmoliyin Varalaru'', insisted that all the humans were descendants of the ancient Tamils from Kumari Kandam. Such claims were repeated by several others, including [[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]] and [[Maraimalai Adigal]].&lt;ref name="Sumathi-122-126"/&gt; In 1917, [[Abraham Pandithar]] wrote that Lemuria was the cradle of human race, and Tamil was the first language spoken by the humans. These claims were repeated in the school and college textbooks of Tamil Nadu throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Sumathi-109-113"/&gt;

[[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]], writing in 1927, stated that [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was established by the Tamil survivors from the flood-hit Kumari Nadu. In the 1940s, N. S. Kandiah Pillai published maps showing migration of the Kumari Kandam residents to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;1945. Namatu Natu [Our nation]. Madras: South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. S. Kandiah Pillai, 1957. Varalarruk Kalattirku Murpatta Palantamilar [Prehistoric ancient Tamilians]. 3rd ed. N.p.: Progressive Printers. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, R. Nedunceliyan, who later became the education minister of Tamil Nadu, insisted that the civilization spread from South India to the Indus Valley and [[Sumer]], and subsequently, to "Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Spain and other places".&lt;ref&gt;Nedunceliyan, R. 1953. Marainta Tiravitam [Lost Dravidian land]. Madras: Manram Patippakam.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented modern Tamil as a pale remnant of the glorious ancient Tamil language spoken in Kumari Kandam.&lt;ref name="Sumathi-122-126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=122–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Tamil writers also claimed that the Indo-Aryans were also descendants of proto-Dravidians of Kumari Kandam. According to this theory, these Indo-Aryans belonged to a branch which migrated to Central Asia and then returned to India. Similar explanations were used to reconcile the popular theory that proto-Dravidians migrated to India from the [[Mediterranean region]]. A 1975 Government of Tamil Nadu college text book stated that the Dravidians of Kumari Kandam had migrated to the Mediterranean region after the submergence of their continent; later, they migrated back to India via the [[List of Himalayan peaks and passes#Passes and routes|Himalayan passes]].&lt;ref&gt;Government of Tamilnadu. 1975. ''Tamilnattu Varalaru: Tolpalañkalam [History of Tamilnadu: Prehistoric times]. Madras: Tamilnadu Aracu. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primordial but not primitive ===

The Tamil revivalists did not consider Kumari Kandam as a primitive society or a rural civilization. Instead, they described it as a [[utopia]] which had reached the zenith of human achievement, and where people lived a life devoted to learning, education, travel and commerce. Sumanthi Ramaswamy notes that this "placemaking" of Kumari Kandam was frequently intended as a teaching tool, meant to inspire the modern Tamils to pursue excellence. But this pre-occupation with "civilization" was also a response to the British rulers' projection of the Europeans as more civilized than the Tamils.&lt;ref name="Sumathi-109-113"/&gt;

[[Parithimar Kalaignar|Suryanarayan Sastri]], in 1903, described the antediluvian Tamils as expert cultivators, fine poets and far-traveling merchants, who lived in an egalitarian and democratic society. Savariroyan Pillai, writing a few years later, described Kumari Kandam as a seat of learning and culture. Sivagnana Yogi (1840-1924) stated that this ancient society was free of any [[Indian caste system|caste system]]. Kandiah Pillai, in a 1945 work for children, wrote that Kumarikandam was ruled by a strong and just emperor called Sengon, who organized the sangams. In 1981, the Government of Tamil Nadu funded a documentary film on Kumari Kandam. The film, personally backed by the Chief Minister [[M. G. Ramachandran]] and directed by [[P. Neelakantan]], was screened at the Fifth International Conference of Tamil Studies in Madurai. It combined the continental drift theory with the submerged continent theory to present Lemuria as a scientifically valid concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicted Kumari Kandam cities resplendent with mansions, gardens, arts, crafts, music and dance.&lt;ref name="Sumathi-109-113"/&gt;

=== Lost works ===

The Tamil revivalists insisted that the first two [[Tamil Sangam|Tamil sangams]] (literary academies) were not mythical, and happened in the Kumari Kandam era. While most Tamil revivalists did not enumerate or list the lost Sangam works, some came up with their names, and even listed their contents. In 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri named some of these works as ''Mutunarai'', ''Mutukuruku'', ''Mapuranam'' and ''Putupuranam''. In 1917, [[Abraham Pandithar]] listed three of these works as the world's first [[treatise]]s of music: ''Naratiyam'', ''Perunarai'' and ''Perunkuruku''. He also listed several rare musical instruments such as the thousand-stringed [[lute]], which had been lost to the sea. [[Devaneya Pavanar]] printed an entire list of the submerged books. Others listed books on a wide range of topics, including medicine, martial arts, logic, painting, sculpture, yoga, philosophy, music, mathematics, alchemy, magic, architecture, poetry, and wealth. Since these works had been lost to the sea, the Kumari Kandam proponents insisted that no empirical proof could be provided for their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Chidambaranar published a book called ''Cenkonraraiccelavu'', claiming that he had 'discovered' the manuscript from "some old cudgan {{sic}} leaves". The book was presented as a lost-and-found work of the first Sangam at Tenmadurai. The author of the poem was styled as Mutaluli Centan Taniyur ("Chentan who lived in Taniyur before the first deluge"). The work talked about the exploits of an antediluvian Tamil king Sengon, who ruled the now-submerged kingdom of Peruvalanatu, the region between the rivers Kumari and Pahruli.  According to Chidambaranar, Sengon was a native of Olinadu, which was located south of the [[Equator]]; the king maintained several [[battleship]]s and conquered lands as far as [[Tibet]]. In 1950s, ''Cenkonraraiccelavu'' was declared as a [[literary forgery|forgery]] by [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]]. However, this did not stop the Tamil revivalists from invoking the text. The 1981 documentary funded by Government of Tamil Nadu declared it as the "world's first [[travel literature|travelogue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent ==

The medieval commentator Adiyarkunallar stated that the size of the land south of Kanyakumari, lost to the sea was 700 ''kavatam''. The modern equivalent of kavatam is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Arasan Shanmugham Pillai wrote that this land amounted to thousands of miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Purnalingam Pillai and Suryanarayana Sastri, the number was equivalent to 7000 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Subramania Sastri 1915–16, 420–21; Swaminatha Aiyar 1978, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Abraham Pandither, Aiyan Aarithan, Devaneyan and Raghava Aiyangar offered estimates ranging from 1,400 to 3,000 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Pandither 1984, 55; Aiyan Aarithan 1904–5, 274; Devaneyan 1940, 50; Raghava Aiyangar 1938, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]], only the land amounting in area to only a few villages (equivalent to the Tamil measure of two kurram) was lost. In 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri suggested that Kumari Kandam extended from the present-day Kanyakumari in North to [[Kerguelen Islands]] in South, and from [[Madagascar]] in the West to [[Sunda Islands]] in the East. In 1912, Somasundara Bharati wrote that the continent touched China, Africa, Australia and Kanyakumari on four sides. In 1948, Maraimalai Adigal stated that the continent stretched as far as the [[South Pole]]. Somasundara Bharati offered an estimate of 6000–7000 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maps ===

The first map to visualize Lemuria as an ancient Tamil territory was published by S. Subramania Sastri in 1916, in the journal ''Centamil''. This map was actually part of an article that criticized the pseudohistorical claims about a lost continent. Sastri insisted that the lost land mentioned in Adiyarkunallar's records was barely equivalent to a [[taluka]] (not larger than a few hundred square miles). The map depicted two different versions of Kumari Kandam: that of Sastri, and that of A. Shanmugam Pillai (see above). The lost land was depicted as a peninsula, similar to the present-day Indian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Subramania Sastri 1915–16, 466–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Purnalingam Pillai published a map titled "Puranic India before the Deluges", in which he labeled the various places of Kumari Kandam with names drawn from ancient Tamil and Sanskrit literary works. Pulavar Kulanthai, in his 1946 map, was first to depict cities like Tenmaturai and Kapatapuram on the maps of Kumari Kandam. Several maps also depicted the various mountain ranges and rivers of Kumari Kandam. The most elaborate cartographic visualization appeared in a 1977 map by R. Mathivanan. This map showed the 49 ''nadu''s mentioned by Adiyarkunallar, and appears in the Tamil Nadu government's 1981 documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1981 map published by N. Mahalingam depicted the lost land as "Submerged Tamil Nadu" in 30,000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Mahalingam 1981b, 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 map, created by R. Mathivanan, showed a [[land bridge]] connecting Indian peninsula to [[Antarctica]]. A few Tamil writers also depicted [[Gondwanaland]] as Kumari Kandam.&lt;ref name="Sumathi204-211"/&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

Concept of Lemuria continues to be found in pseudo-scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkGCvocYtYgC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=|title=Among Stone Giants: The Life of Katherine Routledge and Her Remarkable Expedition to Easter Island|page=283|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The day of the dinosaur|page=66|publisher=Bonanza Books|author=Lyon Sprague De Camp, Catherine Crook De Camp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SQ1FVXpftgC&amp;q=lemuria+pseudoscientific+cult&amp;dq=lemuria+pseudoscientific+cult&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB1cSh-Y_KAhUBT44KHbKtAtEQ6AEIOTAF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempts to mix the Lemuria myth with Tamil history have attracted criticism since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest criticisms came from M Seshagiri Sastri (1897), who described the claims of ante-diluvial sangams as "a mere fiction originated by the prolific imagination of Tamil poets."&lt;ref name="Sastri1897"&gt;{{cite book |author=M. Seshagiri Sastri |title=Essay on Tamil Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXtunQEACAAJ |year=1897 |publisher=Printed at the S.P.C.K. Press | page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CH Monahan wrote a scathing review of Suryanarayana Sastri's ''Tamilmoliyin Varalaru'' (1903), shortly after its publication, accusing the author of "abandoning scientific research for mythology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K. N. Sivaraja Pillai]] (1932) similarly stressed on the need to closely examine the historical authenticity of Sangam works and their commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sivaraja Pillai |title=The Chronology of the Early Tamils |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9VRgByEFJ0C |origyear=1932 |year=2007 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4067-5885-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, [[K. A. Nilakanta Sastri]] described the Kumari Kandam theory as "all bosh", stating that geological theories about events happening millions of years ago should not be connected to the human history of a few thousand years back.&lt;ref name="KANS1941"&gt;{{cite book |author=KA Nilakanta Sastri |title=Historical Method in Relation to Problems of South Indian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMDgGwAACAAJ |origyear=1941 |publisher=University of Madras |year=1956 |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian N. Subrahmanian, writing in 1966, described the Lemuria myth as the most characteristic example of "anti-history" in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy 2004 151"/&gt; He noted that these myths persisted in the minds of Tamil people despite modern education.&lt;ref name="NS1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=N. Subrahmanian |title=The Tamils: Their History, Culture, and Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQZuAAAAMAAJ |year=1996 |publisher=Institute of Asian Studies |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the land lost to sea, as described in the ancient Tamil legends, was a small area comparable to a present-day [[List of districts in Tamil Nadu|district]], and submerged around 5th or 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name="SChris2011"/&gt;

The same view is also shared by historian [[K. K. Pillay]]. He writes

{{quote|... to accept this is not to accept the view that the entire Lemuria or [[Gondwana|Gondvana]] continent existed in the age of the Tamil Sangam, as is sometimes believed. Some of the writers on the Tamil Sangam might have held that the first Tamil Academy flourished in South Madurai which according to them lay to the south of the tip of present South India. This view has been sought to be reinforced by the Lemurian theory. But it is important to observe that the Lemurian continent must have existed, if at all, long long ago. According to geologists, the dismemberment of the Lemurian or Gondvana continent into several units must have taken place towards the close of the Mesozoic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South India and Ceylon|year=1963|publisher=University of Madras|first=K.

==In popular culture==

''Kandam'' (2016) is a [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]]/[[Sri Lanka]]n film directed by Pras Lingam. The film is based on the premise of the existence of the continent of Kumari Kandam and the prevalence of Tamil civilization in antediluvian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thamarai.com/events/cinema/kandam-uk-european-premiere|title=Kandam {{!}} UK premiere of Tamil independent film by Pras Lingam - Thamarai|newspaper=Thamarai|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumari Kandam appeared in ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]'' episodes "The King of Kumari Kandam" and "The Atlas Pin". This version is a city on the back of a giant sea serpent with its inhabitants all fish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The King of Kumari Kandam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcQgk3vdpagC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2009 |publisher=Random House Children's Books |isbn=978-0-375-86429-2 |pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumari Kandam appeared on Season Two, Episode Three of the History Channel television show ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title= Underwater Worlds |url= http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/season-2/episode-3 |year=2010 | website=The History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">A '''legislative calendar''' is used by legislatures to plan their business during the [[legislative session]]. 

== Calendar ==
Typically, one of the first items mentioned on the calendar is passing the bill enacting procedures and deadlines for the session. Time may also be allotted for considering the [[Government budget|budget bill]], which is usually the major item of business in a session. The calendar may provide scheduled committee hearings and generally includes many important deadlines. 

For instance, California has a fiscal deadline, which is the date on the legislative calendar by which all bills with fiscal effect must have been taken up in a policy Committee and referred to a fiscal Committee; any fiscal bill missing the deadline is considered "dead" unless it receives a rule waiver allowing further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.ca.gov/quicklinks/glossary.html California State Legislature—Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some legislatures have a "crossover day," which is the point in the session after which each house only considers legislation sent to it by the other house. In the U.S. Congress, the phrase "placed on calendar" accompanies a bill that is pending before committees of either house; the bill is assigned a calendar number, which determines when it will be considered by that house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/bills/glossary.html Congressional Bills: Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312025413/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/bills/glossary.html |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a legislative calendar, a "legislative day" is a day on which the Legislature actually meets. The Virginia General Assembly has six legislative days per week (Monday through Saturday), probably reflecting the desire to have a [[citizen legislature]] that accomplishes its business in a relatively short, intense annual session, after which the members return to their full-time employment. The Oklahoma legislature, by contrast, has four legislative days per week.

The daily version of the legislative calendar is sometimes called the daily file, agenda or calendar, which lists all the bills that will be considered on a given day. 

The term "legislative calendar" can also refer to the final published compilation of the action on each instrument during a legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/glossary.htm Louisiana State Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225075018/http://www.legis.state.la.us/glossary.htm |date=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to a list of legislation available to be heard by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oksenate.gov/legislation/glossary.html Oklahoma State Senate - Legislation: Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91503">The phrase ''[[presidential veto]]'' does not appear in the [[United States Constitution]], but [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]] requires every bill, order, resolution or other act of legislation approved by the [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]] to be presented to the [[President of the United States]] for their approval. After that is done, there are several scenarios in which a bill may or may not be enacted into law.

* The president may sign the bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This enacts the bill into law.
* The president may return the bill to Congress with a statement of objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This is a "veto."
* If the president vetoes a bill, the president's objections shall be considered by the Congress. Each house may vote to override the president's veto. If 2/3 of each house agree to override the president's veto, the bill is enacted into law.
* The president may do nothing, and after 10 days (excluding Sundays) if Congress has not yet adjourned, the bill is enacted into law.
* The president may do nothing, and if Congress adjourns before the 10th day (excluding Sundays), the bill is not enacted into law. This is known as "[[pocket veto]]".

The list below contains many of the bills vetoed and pocket vetoed by Presidents.
{{TOC right}}

==Logic of vetoes==
Although each case is unique and involves a plethora of influences, one general rule can be acknowledged: Presidents use their prerogative to veto legislation when such legislation does not represent their viewpoint or agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=What Time Is It? The Use of Power in Four Different Types of Presidential Time | work=The Journal of Politics | volume=59 | issue=3 | year=1996 | page=683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veto threat==
Occasionally, a President either publicly or privately threatens Congress with a veto to influence the content or passage of legislation. There is no record of what constitutes a "veto threat", or how many have been made over the years, but it has become a staple of Presidential politics and a sometimes effective way of shaping policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A President may also warn Congress of a veto of a particular bill so as to persuade Congress not to waste time passing particular legislation or including certain provisions in a bill when the President is prepared to veto it.

===Grover Cleveland===
{{Main|Grover Cleveland}}
584 total vetoes, including 238 pocket vetoes (414 first term, 170 second term).

Grover Cleveland vetoed more bills in his two terms than all other presidents to that date combined. Only [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who had more than three complete terms in office to Cleveland's two, vetoed more.  Strongly opposed to what he perceived as "[[pork barrel]]" spending, and favoring limited government, he vetoed more than 200 [[private bill]]s granting pensions to individual [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans. Reacting to these vetoes, Congress passed a bill that would have granted a pension to any disabled veteran. He vetoed this bill as well. This is widely perceived to have been a factor in the defeat of his [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888 bid for re-election]].

In addition to these, he also vetoed a bill that would have distributed seed grain to drought-stricken farmers in the American west, and bills increasing the monetary supply.  He also refused to sign, but did not veto, the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act]].

Wilson wrote: "The President is no greater than his prerogative of veto makes him; he is, in other words, powerful rather as a branch of the legislature than as the titular head of the Executive."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W. Congressional Government, 1956 p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

635 vetoes.

Franklin Roosevelt vetoed more bills than any other president in history. This is partly because of the many new ideas for solutions to the problems caused by the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], and partly because he served three terms (he was elected to four). Grover Cleveland vetoed more bills per term.

* October 29, 1974 – Veto of H.R. 6624 Private Relief Bill for Burt, Pope and Kennedy (Miami Herald Reporters)

This bill would have provided for payment, "as a gratuity," of $45,482 to Mr. Burt and for similar payments of $36,750 each to the widow and son of Douglas E. Kennedy for injuries and other damages Mr. Burt and Mr. Kennedy sustained as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted by U.S. military personnel in the Dominican Republic in 1965. &lt;br /&gt;
I considered carefully the merits of this case, but could not approve it. Equitable considerations growing out of governmental actions have traditionally been the basis for private relief awards where no legal remedy is available. But the record clearly establishes that no such considerations are present in this case. &lt;br /&gt;
I urge that in the future Congress adhere to the traditional equity basis for awards, whether or not they have been recommended by the Court of Claims under Congressional reference procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0204/1513058.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKburtA.htm|title=Al Burt|author=John Simkin|work=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

[[Image:Ludovisi throne Altemps Inv8570.jpg|thumb|right|Main panel: "Aphrodite rising from the sea".]]
[[File:Ludovisi throne Altemps Inv8570 n2.jpg|thumb|upright|Right-hand panel: crouching veiled woman offering incense]]

The '''Ludovisi Throne''' is an ancient sculpted block of white marble hollowed at the back and carved with [[bas-relief]]s on the three outer faces. Its authenticity is debated; the majority, who accept it, place it as [[Sculpture of Ancient Greece|Western Greek]], from [[Magna Graecia]], and date it–; from the [[Severe style]] it manifests, transitional between [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] and Early Classical–; to the period about 460 BCE. The Ludovisi Throne has been conserved at the [[National Museum of Rome|Museo Nazionale Romano]] of [[Palazzo Altemps]], [[Rome]], since its purchase for the Italian State in 1894.

The central relief is most customarily read as [[Aphrodite]] rising from the sea, a motif known as [[Venus Anadyomene]] (height 0.9 m, length 1.42 m). The goddess, in clinging diaphanous draperies, is helped by two attendant [[Horae]] standing on the shore, who prepared to veil her with a cloth they jointly hold, which hides her from the waist down. The two reliefs on the flanking sides discreetly turn their backs to the mystery of the central subject. The right relief shows a crouching veiled woman who offers incense from a ''[[thymiaterion]]'' held in her left hand, in an incense burner on a stand.  The right slab's dimensions are height 0.87 m, length 0.69 m. The other shows a young nude girl, seated with one knee thrown over the other&lt;ref&gt;Most references note the anatomical impossibility of the right thigh's positioning.&lt;/ref&gt; who plays the double flute called the ''[[aulos]]''; her hair is bound in a [[kerchief]]. The dimensions of the left slab are height 0.84 m, length 0.68 m.

The [[iconography]] of the subject is without a parallel in Antiquity, thus the very subject of the relief is in doubt. Alternative views, since the flanking attendants stand on pebbled ground, have been offered: that the emerging figure is that of the ritual robing of a [[chthonic]] goddess, probably [[Persephone]], rising from a cleft in the earth—&lt;ref&gt;This suggestion was first made in 1922 by [[Bernard Ashmole]], in ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''42''' pp. 248-53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pandora]] is similarly shown in Attic vase-paintings— or of Hera emerging reborn from the waters of [[Kanathos]] near Tiryns as ''Hera Parthenos''.&lt;ref&gt;The comparison with roughly contemporaneous terracotta votive figures at [[Tiryns]] of Hera with a square cloth shielding her breasts, was noted by S. Casson, "Hera of Kanathos and the Ludovisi Throne" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''40'''.2 (1920, pp. 137-142) p 139. "The cloth, which is clearly the distinguishing cult-sign in these statuettes, is the symbol of Hera τελεία as opposed to Hera παρθένος, whom we may imagine as nude or very lightly clad, and, above all, with her breasts uncovered."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Throne was found in 1887, in the formerly extensive grounds of the [[Villa Ludovisi]], Rome, where the ancient [[gardens of Sallust]] had been located.  It was moved into the Villa Ludovisi,&lt;ref&gt;The last Ludovisi constructed the palatial new palazzo that was sold to Queen Margherita and now houses the American Embassy&lt;/ref&gt; whence the name.&lt;ref&gt;The name was given to the sculpture in an 1892 article by E. Petersen in ''Römische Mitteilungen, VII, (1892) pp 31-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ludovisi (family)|Ludovisi]] are a papal family who have been patrons and collectors since the early seventeenth century. Financial difficulties forced a sale of the Ludovisi collections to the Italian State in 1894. The Villa Ludovisi grounds were broken into lots, streets put through and the district developed and unalterably changed.&lt;ref&gt;Hatswick 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Conclusions about the object's original purpose, the meaning of its reliefs and its place of facture are all debated, but in 1982 it was securely linked to a newly studied temple at Marasa, near [[Locri]],&lt;ref&gt;Ashmole had linked it to a foundation at Locri in 1922; it was his figure on p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; an Ionic temple of Aphrodite that was rebuilt internally in 480 BCE. A reconstruction of the throne was shown to fit exactly into remaining blocks in the temple's foundations, and it has been suggested that terracotta votive plaques, or ''pinakes'', of cults at Lokri Epizefiri, are the only stylistic parallel to the Throne.&lt;ref&gt;Terra 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other representations of the female nude at this period (c. 460) are on Attic pottery. Criticisms of anomalies in anatomy and detail and doubts of the Ludovisi Throne's authenticity were summed up by Jerome Eisenberg in a 1996 article in ''Minerva'', which asserted, in part, that the ''[[hetaira]]'' flute-player was derived from a late-sixth-century BCE ''psykter'' by [[Euphronius]], published in 1857 in the [[State Hermitage|Hermitage]] from the Campana collection.  Eisenberg noted that the much-later Roman representation of Penelope mourning for Ulysses is the only iconological type in classical sculpture which depicts a woman with legs crossed: the Penelope is fully clothed. Penelope awaiting (along with Telemachus) for Odysseus' return to Ithaca is depicted with legs crossed (left leg over right leg, viewed from the left) on an attic red-figure [[skyphos]] from Chiusi, dated ca. 440 BCE.

The Ludovisi Throne's less accomplished twin, the [[Boston Throne]] in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which appeared in 1894, shortly after the Ludovisi auction and was bought by the connoisseur [[Edward Perry Warren]], who donated it to Boston, is widely doubted. A conference at  Palazzo Grassi, Venice, 1996, compared the two objects. Currently it is not on exhibition at Boston. If it is not a forgery of c. 1894, it may be a Roman sculpture designed to complete the Greek one in a setting in the gardens of Sallust. [[Thomas Hoving]], once director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], recollects being told by an art dealer in Italy  that the twin throne in Boston was the work of the great faker Alcide Dossena.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hoving, 1981. King of the Confessors. Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen''' is an [[United States|American]] [[markup language]] specialist. He was co-editor of the Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) 1.0 spec (1998), and chair of the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] working group.

He was also instrumental in the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI), an international cooperative project to develop and disseminate guidelines for the encoding and interchange of electronic text for research.  He was co-editor, with Lou Burnard, of the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]]'s Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange in 1994. He also served as [[Editor in chief]] of the TEI from 1988 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nancy Ide |author2=C. M.

[[XML]] and [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] have become ubiquitous in their domains. Sue Polanka (Head of Reference/Instruction, Wright State University Libraries) notes that the TEI "...in the 1980s and 90s established a fundamental set of methods and practices that now underpin most [[digital humanities]] scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''microfilmer''' is a machine used by the document management industry to create [[microfilm]].  These machines are also often called "imagers" in the industry.  A microfilmer is a [[camera]] that is used to [[photograph]] documents to create a more compact and permanent record of the original in the form of roll-film or [[microfiche]].  Once the information contained on a paper document has been recorded onto [[microfilm]], the information can be viewed later on a microfilm reader or viewer, or reproduced in paper form on a microfilm reader-printer.

Banking and insurance companies often convert their paper records using microfilmers.  Libraries often keep newspapers and magazines which have been converted to roll-film or microfiche form using microfilmers.  Microfilmers are often used to preserve government records.  Many companies have switched from microfilm to digital imaging systems, which offer more convenient computer retrieval of records.

Microfilmers come in two basic configurations: planetary and rotary.  A planetary microfilmer takes a snapshot of a stationary document held on a flat surface.  While the picture is being taken, the film and the document do not move.  In a rotary microfilmer, both the document and the film are moving in sync with one another while the picture is being taken.  This allows for quicker filming of the document.  Planetary microfilmers typically offer higher image resolution than rotary filmers, and can more readily film larger documents, as well as odd-shaped documents, such as books.

In the 1951 film [[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]], a roomful of planetary filmers and their operators are shown as they race against time to preserve crucial books for survivors of a doomed Earth.

'''Mithraism''', also known as the '''Mithraic mysteries''', was a [[mystery religion]] centered on the god '''Mithras''' that was practiced in the [[Roman Empire]] from about the 1st to the 4th century CE. The religion was inspired by [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] worship of the god [[Mithra]], though the Greek ''Mithras'' was linked to a new and distinctive imagery, and the level of continuity between Persian and Greco-Roman practice is debated.&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism | title = Mithraism | accessdate = 2011-03-14 | last = Beck | first = Roger | date =2002-07-20 | publisher = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition | quote = The term "Mithraism" is of course a modern coinage. In antiquity the cult was known as "the mysteries of Mithras"; alternatively, as "the mysteries of the Persians." ... The Mithraists, who were manifestly not Persians in any ethnic sense, thought of themselves as cultic "Persians." ... the ancient Roman Mithraists themselves were convinced that their cult was founded by none other than Zoroaster, who "dedicated to Mithras, the creator and father of all, a cave in the mountains bordering Persia," an idyllic setting "abounding in flowers and springs of water" (Porphyry, On the Cave of the Nymphs 6).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mysteries were popular among the [[Imperial Roman army|Roman military]].&lt;ref name="geden 1"/&gt;

Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of [[initiation]] and communal ritual meals. Initiates called themselves ''syndexioi'', those "united by the handshake".&lt;ref name="claussonhandshake"/&gt; They met in underground [[Roman temple|temples]], now called ''mithraea'' (singular ''[[mithraeum]]''), which survive in large numbers. The [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] appears to have had its centre in [[ancient Rome|Rome]],&lt;ref name="hopfe-5"/&gt; and was popular throughout the [[Western Roman Empire|western half of the empire]], as far south as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] and [[Numidia]], as far north as [[Roman Britain]],&lt;ref name="Clauss26"/&gt; and to a lesser extent in [[Roman Syria]] in the east.&lt;ref name="hopfe-5"/&gt;

Mithraism is viewed as a rival of [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="RichardsonHopfe1994"/&gt; In the 4th century, Mithraists faced persecution from Roman Christians and the religion was subsequently suppressed and eliminated in the empire by the end of the century.&lt;ref name="collectedworks"/&gt;

Numerous archaeological finds, including meeting places, monuments and artifacts, have contributed to modern knowledge about Mithraism throughout the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/paganshadowchrist_article_01.shtml | title = The Pagan Shadow of Christ? | accessdate = 4 June 2011 | last = Beck | first = Roger | date = 17 February 2011 | publisher = BBC-History | quote = We know a good deal about them because archaeology has disinterred many meeting places together with numerous artifacts and representations of the cult myth, mostly in the form of relief sculpture. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iconography|iconic scenes]] of Mithras show him being born from a rock, slaughtering a bull, and sharing a banquet with the god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] (the Sun). About 420 sites have yielded materials related to the cult. Among the items found are about 1000 inscriptions, 700 examples of the bull-killing scene ([[tauroctony]]), and about 400 other monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Clauss | first1 = Manfred | title = The Roman Cult of Mithras: The God and his Mysteries | pages = xxi | isbn = 0-415-92977-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680 [[mithraea]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="HaaseTemporini1984"/&gt; No written narratives or theology from the religion survive; limited information can be derived from the inscriptions and brief or passing references in [[ancient Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature]]. Interpretation of the physical evidence remains problematic and contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|title=Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1991|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506788-6|page=3|quote=However, in the absence of any ancient explanations of its meaning, Mithraic iconography has proven to be exceptionally difficult to decipher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The term "Mithraism" is a modern convention. Writers of the Roman era referred to it by phrases such as "Mithraic mysteries", "mysteries of Mithras" or "mysteries of the Persians".&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04166.htm Origen, Contra Celsus, Book&amp;nbsp;6],&amp;nbsp;Chapter&amp;nbsp;22. "After this, Celsus, desiring to exhibit his learning in his treatise against us, quotes also certain Persian mysteries, where he says: ‘These things are obscurely hinted at in the accounts of the Persians, and especially in the mysteries of Mithras, which are celebrated among them&amp;nbsp;...’&amp;nbsp;" 
Chapter&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;"After the instance borrowed from the Mithraic mysteries, Celsus declares that he who would investigate the Christian mysteries, along with the aforesaid Persian, will, on comparing the two together, and on unveiling the rites of the Christians, see in this way the difference between them."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sources sometimes refer to the Greco-Roman religion as "Roman Mithraism" or "Western Mithraism" to distinguish it from Persian worship of Mithra.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uhu.es/ejms/ | title = Electronic Journal of Mithraic Studies | accessdate = 2011-03-28 | work = Electronic Journal of Mithraic Studies | quote = The Electronic Journal of Mithraic Studies (EJMS) is a revival of the Journal of Mithraic Studies edited by Dr. Richard Gordon.

The exact form of a Latin or classical Greek word varies due to the grammatical process of [[declension]]. There is archaeological evidence that in Latin worshippers wrote the [[nominative]] form of the god's name as "Mithras". However, in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s Greek text ''De{{nbsp}}Abstinentia'' (''Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων''), there is a reference to the now-lost histories of the Mithraic mysteries by Euboulus and Pallas, the wording of which suggests that these authors treated the name "Mithra" as an indeclinable foreign word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Richard L.|title=The date and significance of CIMRM 593 (British Museum, Townley Collection|journal=Journal of Mithraic Studies II|year=1978|pages=148–174}}. p. 160: "The usual western nominative form of Mithras' name in the mysteries ended in ''-s'', as we can see from the one authentic dedication in the nominative, recut over a dedication to Sarapis (463, Terme de Caracalla), and from occasional grammatical errors such as ''deo inviato Metras'' (1443). But it is probable that Euboulus and Pallas at least used the name 'Mithra' as an indeclinable [foreign word] (ap. Porphyry, ''De abstinentia'' II.56 and IV.16)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians have different conceptions about whether these names refer to the same god or not. John R.

[[Mary Boyce]], a researcher of ancient Iranian religions, writes that even though Roman Empire Mithraism seems to have had less Iranian content than historians used to think, nonetheless "as the name ''Mithras'' alone shows, this content was of some importance".&lt;ref name="boyceonname"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Boyce | first1 = Mary | last2 = Grenet | first2 = Frantz | title = Zoroastrianism under Macedonian and Roman rule, Part 1 | publisher = Brill | year = 1975 | pages = 468, 469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWiMV6llZesC&amp;lpg=PA472&amp;dq=inauthor%3Amary%20inauthor%3Aboyce%20mithra&amp;pg=PA468#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor:mary%20inauthor:boyce%20mithra&amp;f=true | accessdate = 2011-03-16 | isbn = 90-04-09271-4 | quote = The theory that the complex iconography of the characteristic monuments (of which the oldest belong to the second century A.C.) could be interpreted by direct reference to Iranian religion is now widely rejected; and recent studies have tended greatly to reduce what appears to be the actual Iranian content of this "self consciously ‘Persian’ religion", at least in the form which it attained under the Roman empire. Nevertheless, as the name Mithras alone shows, this content was of some importance; and the Persian affiliation of the Mysteries is acknowledged in the earliest literary reference to them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Neuenheimer Mithraeum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Relief of Mithras as bull-slayer from Neuenheim near [[Heidelberg]], framed by scenes from Mithras' life.]]

Much about the cult of Mithras is only known from reliefs and sculptures.  There have been many attempts to interpret this material.

Mithras-worship in the Roman Empire was characterized by images of the god slaughtering a bull. Other images of Mithras are found in the Roman temples, for instance Mithras banqueting with Sol, and depictions of the birth of Mithras from a rock. But the image of bull-slaying (tauroctony) is always in the central niche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|title=Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1991|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506788-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual sources for a reconstruction of the theology behind this iconography are very rare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Clauss, M. ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.{{nbsp}}xxi: "...{{nbsp}}we possess virtually no theological statements either by Mithraists themselves or by other writers."&lt;/ref&gt; (See section [[#Interpretations of the bull-slaying scene|Interpretations of the bull-slaying scene]] below.)

The practice of depicting the god slaying a bull seems to be specific to Roman Mithraism. According to David Ulansey, this is "perhaps the most important example" of evident difference between Iranian and Roman traditions: "...{{nbsp}}there is no evidence that the Iranian god [[Mithra]] ever had anything to do with killing a bull."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|title=Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1991|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506788-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bull-slaying scene===
{{See also|Tauroctony}}
In every mithraeum the centrepiece was a representation of Mithras killing a sacred bull, an act called the tauroctony.{{efn-ua|After the Greek word ''tauroktónos'' (ταυροκτόνος, "bull killing")}}&lt;ref&gt;David Ulansey, ''The origins of the Mithraic mysteries'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=25_SOWldSUUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=cumont+tauroctony&amp;ei=ZzTPSrbSLo3WygSpt_ywBg#v=onepage&amp;q=cumont%20tauroctony&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;6]: "Although the iconography of the cult varied a great deal from temple to temple, there is one element of the cult’s iconography which was present in essentially the same form in every mithraeum and which, moreover, was clearly of the utmost importance to the cult’s ideology; namely the so-called tauroctony, or bull-slaying scene, in which the god Mithras, accompanied by a series of other figures, is depicted in the act of killing the bull."&lt;/ref&gt; The image may be a relief, or free-standing, and side details may be present or omitted.  The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in [[Anatolia]]n costume and wearing a [[Phrygian cap]]; who is kneeling on the exhausted&lt;ref name="Clauss, M. p.{{nbsp}}77"&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;  bull, holding it by the nostrils&lt;ref name="Clauss, M. p.{{nbsp}}77"/&gt;  with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, he looks over his shoulder towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. A raven is flying around or is sitting on the bull. Three ears of wheat are seen coming out from the bull's tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white.

The event takes place in a cavern, into which Mithras has carried the bull, after having hunted it, ridden it and overwhelmed its strength.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.{{nbsp}}74.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the cavern is surrounded by a circle, on which the twelve signs of the zodiac appear.  Outside the cavern, top left, is [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] the sun, with his flaming crown, often driving a [[quadriga]]. A ray of light often reaches down to touch Mithras. At the top right is [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]], with her crescent moon, who may be depicted driving a [[biga (chariot)|biga]].&lt;ref name="griffithlecole"&gt;L'Ecole Initiative: Alison Griffith, 1996. [http://www2.evansville.edu/ecoleweb/articles/mithraism.html "Mithraism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some depictions, the central tauroctony is framed by a series of subsidiary scenes to the left, top and right, illustrating events in the Mithras narrative; Mithras being born from the rock, the water miracle, the hunting and riding of the bull, meeting Sol who kneels to him, shaking hands with [[Sol Invictus|Sol]] and sharing a meal of bull-parts with him, and ascending to the heavens in a chariot.&lt;ref name="griffithlecole"/&gt; In some instances, as is the case in the stucco icon at [[Santa Prisca Church (Rome)|Santa Prisca]] Mithraeum in Rome, the god is shown [[heroic nudity|heroically nude]].&lt;ref name="jonasicondescription"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bjørnebye | first1 = Jonas | title = Hic locus est felix, sanctus, piusque benignus: The cult of Mithras in fourth century Rome, Dissertation for the degree of philosophiae doctor (PhD) | chapter = The Mithraic icon in fourth century Rome:The composition of the Mithraic cult icon | year = 2007 | quote = The figure of Mithras himself is usually attired in an oriental costume of Phrygian cap, tunica manicata (a long-sleeved tunic), [[anaxyrides]] (eastern style trousers), and a cape, though in some cases, he is depicted heroically nude or even, in a unique example from Ostia, in what seems to be a Greek chiton. Like the general trend in Graeco-Roman art, most if not all tauroctony scenes, regardless of the medium they were executed in, were painted, and the different items of Mithras' clothing was usually colored in either blue or red, often, as in the painting at Marino, with most of the costume in red with only the inside of the cape being blue and star-speckled. The bull was often white, sometimes wearing the dorsuale, the Roman sacrificial band in reds or browns, while the torchbearers could be depicted in a variety of colors with reds and greens being the most common.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reliefs were constructed so that they could be turned on an axis.

===Banquet===
The second most important scene after the tauroctony in Mithraic art is the so-called banquet scene.&lt;ref name="Beck_2004_3"&gt;Beck, Roger, "In the Place of the Lion: Mithras in the Tauroctony" in ''Beck on Mithraism: Collected works with new essays'' (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; The banquet scene features Mithras and Sol Invictus banqueting on the hide of the slaughtered bull.&lt;ref name="Beck_2004_3"/&gt; On the specific banquet scene on the Fiano Romano relief, one of the torchbearers points a [[caduceus]] towards the base of an altar, where flames appear to spring up. Robert Turcan has argued that since the caduceus is an attribute of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and in mythology Mercury is depicted as a [[psychopomp]], the eliciting of flames in this scene is referring to the dispatch of human souls and expressing the Mithraic doctrine on this matter.&lt;ref name="Beck_2006_27_28"/&gt; Turcan also connects this event to the tauroctony: the blood of the slain bull has soaked the ground at the base of the altar, and from the blood the souls are elicited in flames by the caduceus.&lt;ref name="Beck_2006_27_28"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Roger|title=The Religion of the Mithras Cult in the Roman Empire|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-921613-4|year=2007}}, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithras is depicted as being born from a rock. He is shown as emerging from a rock, already in his youth,  with a dagger in one hand and a torch in the other. He is nude, standing with his legs together, and is wearing a Phrygian cap.&lt;ref name="vermaserenonbirth"/&gt;

However, there are variations. Sometimes he is shown as coming out of the rock as a child, and in one instance he has a globe in one hand; sometimes a thunderbolt is seen. There are also depictions in which flames are shooting from the rock and also from Mithras' cap. One statue had its base perforated so that it could serve as a fountain, and the base of another has the mask of the water god. Sometimes Mithras also has other weapons such as bows and arrows, and there are also animals such as dogs, serpents, [[dolphin]]s, eagles, other birds, lion, crocodiles, [[lobster]]s and snails around. On some reliefs, there is a bearded figure identified as [[Oceanus]], the water god, and on some there are the gods of the four winds. In these reliefs, the four elements could be invoked together. Sometimes Victoria, [[Selene|Luna]], [[Sol Invictus|Sol]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] also seem to play a role. Saturn in particular is often seen handing over the dagger to Mithras so that he can perform his mighty deeds.&lt;ref name="vermaserenonbirth"/&gt;

In some depictions, Cautes and Cautopates are also present; sometimes they are depicted as shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermaseren|first=M.

On some occasions, an [[amphora]] is seen, and a few instances show variations like an egg birth or a tree birth. Some interpretations show that the birth of Mithras was celebrated by lighting torches or candles.&lt;ref name="vermaserenonbirth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermaseren|first=M.

===Lion-headed figure===
{{anchor|Lion_headed_figure}}
[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Drawing of the leontocephaline found at a mithraeum in [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (190&amp;nbsp;CE; [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;312)]]

One of the most characteristic and poorly-understood features of the Mysteries is the naked lion-headed figure often found in Mithraic temples, named by the modern scholars with descriptive terms such as ''leontocephaline'' (lion-headed) or ''leontocephalus'' (lion-head).

His body is a naked man’s, entwined by a serpent (or two serpents, like a [[caduceus]]), with the snake’s head often resting on the lion’s head. The lion’s mouth is often open, giving a horrifying impression. He is usually represented as having four wings, two keys (sometimes a single key), and a scepter in his hand. Sometimes the figure is standing on a globe inscribed with a diagonal cross. On the figure from the Ostia Antica Mithraeum (left, [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;312), the four wings carry the symbols of the four seasons, and a thunderbolt is engraved on his chest. At the base of the statue are the hammer and tongs of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury’s]] [[rooster|cock]] and wand ([[caduceus]]). A variation of the same figure, but with a human head instead of the lion-mask, is also found, but is rare.&lt;ref name="von_Gall"&gt;von Gall, Hubertus. (1978). The Lion-headed and the Human-headed God in the Mithraic Mysteries. [in] [[Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin]] ed. ''Études mithriaques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;511&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cumont Franz, ''The Mysteries of Mithras'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/mom/mom07.htm p.&amp;nbsp;105]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although animal-headed figures are prevalent in contemporary Egyptian and Gnostic mythological representations, no exact parallel to the Mithraic leontocephaline figure has been found.&lt;ref name="von_Gall"/&gt;

The name of the figure has been deciphered from dedicatory inscriptions to be ''[[Arimanius]]'', a Latinized form  of the name ''[[Ahriman]]'' &amp;ndash; a demonic figure in the Zoroastrian pantheon. Arimanius is known from inscriptions to have been a god in the Mithraic cult as seen, for example, in images from the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae]]'' (CIMRM) such as [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;222 from Ostia, [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;369 from Rome, and [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;1773 and 1775 from Pannonia.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, Howard M.

Some scholars identify the lion-man as [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], or [[Zurvan]], or [[Cronus]], or [[Chronos]], while others assert that it is a version of the Zoroastrian [[Ahriman]] or Vedic [[Aryaman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However an occultist, D.&amp;nbsp;Jason Cooper, speculates to the contrary that the lion-headed figure is not a god, but rather represents the spiritual state achieved in Mithraism's “adept” level, the Leo (lion) degree.

The festival of ''[[Sol Invictus#Festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti|Natalis Invicti]]'', held on 25&amp;nbsp;December, was a general festival of the Sun, and by no means specific to the Mysteries of Mithras."&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, Manfred. ''Mithras: Kult und Mysterien''. München: Beck, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;!-- "...&amp;nbsp;[erwähnenswert wäre dass das Mithras-Kult keine öffentlichen Zeremonien kannte. Das Fest der natalis Invicti, der 25.&amp;nbsp;Dezember, war ein allgemeines Sonnenfest und somit keineswegs auf die Mithras-Mysterien beschränkt. Es gab also im Mithras-Kult nichts vergleichbares zu den großen Feiern und Festlichkeiten anderer Kulte&amp;nbsp;..." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraic initiates were required to swear an oath of secrecy and dedication,&lt;ref name="novaroma.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.novaroma.org/nr/Sodalitas_Graeciae_%28Nova_Roma%29/Religion_from_the_Papyri/Mithraism |title= Sodalitas Graeciae (Nova Roma)/Religion from the Papyri/Mithraism |publisher= Nova Roma |date=2009-03-11 |accessdate= 2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some grade rituals involved the recital of a [[catechism]], wherein the initiate was asked a series of questions pertaining to the initiation symbolism and had to reply with specific answers. An example of such a catechism, apparently pertaining to the Leo grade, was discovered in a fragmentary Egyptian [[papyrus]] (P.Berolinensis 21196),&lt;ref name="novaroma.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=n_chUNOsOYT86gG_iICgCw&amp;id=GonXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mithraic+catechism&amp;q=catechism#search_anchor] William M.

(1976) [http://www.hermetic.com/pgm/mithras-liturgy.html The "Mithras Liturgy"].&lt;/ref&gt; The walls of mithraea were commonly whitewashed, and where this survives it tends to carry extensive repositories of [[graffiti]]; and these, together with inscriptions on Mithraic monuments, form the main source for Mithraic texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Francis |first= E.D. |editor= Hinnells, John R. |year=1971 |title="Mithraic graffiti from Dura-Europos", in ''Mithraic Studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2 |publisher= Manchester University Press |pages= 424&amp;ndash;445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is clear from the archaeology of numerous mithraea that most rituals were associated with feasting &amp;ndash; as eating utensils and food residues are almost invariably found. These tend to include both animal bones and also very large quantities of fruit residues.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of large amounts of cherry-stones in particular would tend to confirm mid-summer (late June, early July) as a season especially associated with Mithraic festivities. The [[Virunum]] ''album'', in the form of an inscribed bronze plaque, records a Mithraic festival of commemoration as taking place on 26&amp;nbsp;June 184. Beck argues that religious celebrations on this date are indicative of special significance being given to the summer [[solstice]]; but this time of the year coincides with ancient recognition of the solar maximum at midsummer, whilst iconographically identical holidays such as [[Litha]], [[St John's Eve]], and [[Jāņi]] are observed also.

For their feasts, Mithraic initiates reclined on stone benches arranged along the longer sides of the mithraeum{{snd}}typically there might be room for 15 to 30 diners, but very rarely many more than 40 men.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Counterpart dining rooms, or ''[[triclinium|triclinia]]'', were to be found above ground in the precincts of almost any temple or religious sanctuary in the Roman empire, and such rooms were commonly used for their regular feasts by Roman 'clubs', or ''[[collegia]]''. Mithraic feasts probably performed a very similar function for Mithraists as the ''collegia'' did for those entitled to join them; indeed, since qualification for Roman ''collegia'' tended to be restricted to particular families, localities or traditional trades, Mithraism may have functioned in part as providing clubs for the unclubbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Burkert |first= Walter |year=1987 |title= Ancient Mystery Cults |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-03387-6 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the size of the mithraeum is not necessarily an indication of the size of the congregation.&lt;ref name="jonas-secretive"/&gt;

Each mithraeum had several [[altar]]s at the further end, underneath the representation of the tauroctony, and also commonly contained considerable numbers of subsidiary altars, both in the main mithraeum chamber and in the ante-chamber or [[narthex]].&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; These altars, which are of the standard Roman pattern, each carry a named dedicatory inscription from a particular initiate, who dedicated the altar to Mithras "in fulfillment of his vow", in gratitude for favours received. Burned residues of animal entrails are commonly found on the main altars indicating regular sacrificial use. However, mithraea do not commonly appear to have been provided with facilities for ritual slaughter of sacrificial animals (a highly specialised function in Roman religion), and it may be presumed that a mithraeum would have made arrangements for this service to be provided for them in co-operation with the professional ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victimarius|victimarius]]''&lt;ref&gt;Price S &amp; Kearns E, ''Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion'', p.568.&lt;/ref&gt; of the civic cult. Prayers were addressed to the Sun three times a day, and Sunday was especially sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonía Tripolitis|title=Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman age|year=2002|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4913-7|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is doubtful whether Mithraism had a monolithic and internally consistent doctrine.&lt;ref name="Beck_2006_85_87"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Roger|title=The Religion of the Mithras Cult in the Roman Empire|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-921613-4|year=2007|quote=Nevertheless, the fact that Porphyry and/or his sources would have had no scruples about adapting or even inventing Mithraic data to suit their arguments does not necessarily mean that they actually did so. It is far more likely that Mithraic doctrine (in the weak sense of the term!) really was what the philosophers said it was... there are no insuperable discrepancies between Mithraic practice and theory as attested in Porphyry and Mithraic practice and theory as archaeology has allowed us to recover them. Even if there were major discrepancies, they would matter only in the context of the old model of an internally consistent and monolithic Mithraic doctrine.}}, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have varied from location to location.&lt;ref&gt;"Beck on Mithraism", ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the iconography is relatively coherent.&lt;ref name="griffithlecole"/&gt; It had no predominant sanctuary or cultic centre; and, although each mithraeum had its own officers and functionaries, there was no central supervisory authority. In some mithraea, such as that at [[Dura Europos]], wall paintings depict prophets carrying scrolls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hinnells, John R.|year=1971|title=Mithraic Studies, vol. 2|publisher=Manchester University Press}} plate 25&lt;/ref&gt; but no named Mithraic sages are known, nor does any reference give the title of any Mithraic scripture or teaching. It is known that intitates could transfer with their grades from one Mithraeum to another.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temples of Mithras are sunk below ground, windowless, and very distinctive. In cities, the basement of an apartment block might be converted; elsewhere they might be excavated and vaulted over, or converted from a natural cave. Mithraic temples are common in the empire; although unevenly distributed, with considerable numbers found in [[Rome]], [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], [[Numidia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and along the Rhine/Danube frontier; while being somewhat less common in [[Roman Greece|Greece]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Roman Syria|Syria]].&lt;ref name="Clauss26"&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', pages 26 and 27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Burkert, the secret character of Mithriac rituals meant that Mithraism could only be practiced within a Mithraeum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|year=1987|title=Ancient Mystery Cults|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03387-6|page= 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new finds at [[Tienen]] show evidence of large-scale feasting and suggest that the mystery religion may not have been as secretive as was generally believed.&lt;ref name="jonas-secretive"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bjørnebye | first1 = Jonas | title = Hic locus est felix, sanctus, piusque benignus: The cult of Mithras in fourth century Rome, Dissertation for the degree of philosophiae doctor (PhD) | year = 2007 | pages = 12, 36 | quote = The discovery of a large quantity of tableware as well as animal remains in a pit outside the newly excavated mithraeum at Tienen, Belgium, has also attracted new attention to the topic of Mithraic processions and large-scale feasts, begging a re-examination of the secrecy of the cult and its visibility in local society...provides evidence for large-scale, semi-public feasts outside of the mithraeum itself, suggesting that each mithraeum might have had a far larger following than its relative size would imply. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part, mithraea tend to be small, externally undistinguished, and cheaply constructed; the cult generally preferring to create a new centre rather than expand an existing one. The mithraeum represented the cave to which Mithras carried and then killed the bull; and where stone vaulting could not be afforded, the effect would be imitated with lath and plaster. They are commonly located close to springs or streams; fresh water appears to have been required for some Mithraic rituals, and a basin is often incorporated into the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; There is usually a [[narthex]] or ante-chamber at the entrance, and often other ancillary rooms for storage and the preparation of food. The extant mithraea present us with actual physical remains of the architectural structures of the sacred spaces of the Mithraic cult. Mithraeum is a modern coinage and mithraists referred to their sacred structures as ''speleum'' or ''antrum'' (cave), ''crypta'' (underground hallway or corridor), ''fanum'' (sacred or holy place), or even ''templum'' (a temple or a sacred space).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bjørnebye | first1 = Jonas | title = Hic locus est felix, sanctus, piusque benignus: The cult of Mithras in fourth century Rome, Dissertation for the degree of philosophiae doctor (PhD) | chapter = The mithraea as buildings | year = 2007 | quote = The extant mithraea present us with actual physical remains of the architectural structures of the sacred spaces of the Mithraic cult. While the Mithraists themselves never used the word mithraeum as far as we know, but preferred words like speleum or antrum (cave), crypta (underground hallway or corridor), fanum (sacred or holy place), or even templum (a temple or a sacred space), the word mithraeum is the common appellation in Mithraic scholarship and is used throughout this study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their basic form, mithraea were entirely different from the temples and shrines of other cults. In the standard pattern of Roman religious precincts, the temple building functioned as a house for the god, who was intended to be able to view through the opened doors and columnar portico, sacrificial worship being offered on an altar set in an open courtyard; potentially accessible not only to initiates of the cult, but also to ''colitores'' or non-initiated worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Price S &amp; Kearns E, ''Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion'', p.&amp;nbsp;493.&lt;/ref&gt; Mithraea were the antithesis of this.&lt;ref&gt;Price S &amp; Kearns E, ''Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion'', p.&amp;nbsp;355.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degrees of initiation===
In the [[Suda]] under the entry ''Mithras'', it states that “No one was permitted to be initiated into them (the mysteries of Mithras), until he should show himself holy and steadfast by undergoing several graduated tests.”&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;102. The Suda reference given is 3:&amp;nbsp;394, M&amp;nbsp;1045 (Adler).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Nazianzen]] refers to the “tests in the mysteries of Mithras”.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;102. The Gregory reference given is to ''Oratio'' 4.70&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were seven grades of initiation into Mithraism, which are listed by St.&amp;nbsp;Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Letters'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-06/letters/lette107.htm 107, ch. 2] (To Laeta)&lt;/ref&gt; Manfred Clauss states that the number of grades, seven, must be connected to the planets. A mosaic in the Mithraeum of Felicissimus,&lt;!--article [[Felicissimus]] is the wrong man --&gt; [[Ostia Antica]] depicts these grades, with symbolic emblems that are connected either to the grades or are symbols of the planets. The grades also have an inscription beside them commending each grade into the protection of the different planetary gods.&lt;ref&gt;M.Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.132-133&lt;/ref&gt; In ascending order of importance, the initiatory grades were:&lt;ref&gt;M.Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.133-138&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Elsewhere, as at [[Dura-Europos]], Mithraic graffiti survive giving membership lists, in which initiates of a mithraeum are named with their Mithraic grades. At Virunum, the membership list or ''album sacratorum'' was maintained as an inscribed plaque, updated year by year as new members were initiated. By cross-referencing these lists it is possible to track some initiates from one mithraeum to another; and also speculatively to identify Mithraic initiates with persons on other contemporary lists such as military service rolls and lists of devotees of non-Mithraic religious sanctuaries. Names of initiates are also found in the dedication inscriptions of altars and other cult objects. Clauss noted in 1990 that overall, only about 14% of Mithriac names inscribed before 250&amp;nbsp;CE identify the initiate's grade – and hence questioned the traditional view that all initiates belonged to one of the seven grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clauss|first=Manfred|title=Die sieben Grade des Mithras-Kultes|journal=ZPE|volume=82|year=1990|pages=183–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clauss argues that the grades represented a distinct class of priests, ''sacerdotes''. Gordon maintains the former theory of Merkelbach and others, especially noting such examples as Dura where all names are associated with a Mithraic grade. Some scholars maintain that practice may have differed over time, or from one Mithraeum to another.

The highest grade, ''pater'', is far the most common found on dedications and inscriptions &amp;ndash; and it would appear not to have been unusual for a mithraeum to have several men with this grade. The form ''pater patrum'' (father of fathers) is often found, which appears to indicate the ''pater'' with primary status. There are several examples of persons, commonly those of higher social status, joining a mithraeum with the status ''pater'' – especially in Rome during the '[[Julian the Apostate#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|pagan revival]]' of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century. It has been suggested that some mithraea may have awarded honorary ''pater'' status to sympathetic dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=Alison|title=Mithraism in the private and public lives of 4th-c. senators in Rome|journal=EJMS|volume=|year=|pages=}} {{cite web |url=http://www.uhu.es/ejms/Papers/Volume1Papers/ABGMS.DOC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928222225/http://www.uhu.es/ejms/Papers/Volume1Papers/ABGMS.DOC |archivedate=2010-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiate into each grade appears to have been required to undertake a specific ordeal or test,&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; involving exposure to heat, cold or threatened peril. An 'ordeal pit', dating to the early 3rd&amp;nbsp;century, has been identified in the mithraeum at [[Carrawburgh]]. Accounts of the cruelty of the emperor [[Commodus]] describes his amusing himself by enacting Mithriac initiation ordeals in homicidal form. By the later 3rd&amp;nbsp;century, the enacted trials appear to have been abated in rigor, as 'ordeal pits' were floored over.

Admission into the community was completed with a handshake with the ''pater'', just as Mithras and Sol shook hands.  The initiates were thus referred to as ''syndexioi'' (those united by the handshake). The term is used in an inscription by Proficentius&lt;ref name="claussonhandshake"&gt;M. Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;42: "That the hand-shaken might make their vows joyfully forever"&lt;/ref&gt; and derided by [[Firmicus Maternus]] in ''De errore profanarum religionum'',&lt;ref&gt;M. Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;105: "the followers of Mithras were the ‘initiates of the theft of the bull, united by the handshake of the illustrious father’."

===Ritual re-enactments===
[[File:Bible museum - Mithrasheiligtum.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a mithraeum with a mosaic depicting the grades of initiation]]
Activities of the most prominent deities in Mithraic scenes, Sol and Mithras, were imitated in rituals by the two most senior officers in the cult's hierarchy, the ''Pater'' and the ''Heliodromus''.&lt;ref name="Beck_2004_288_289"&gt;"Beck on Mithraism", pp.{{nbsp}}288–289&lt;/ref&gt; The initiates held a sacramental banquet, replicating the feast of Mithras and Sol.&lt;ref name="Beck_2004_288_289" /&gt;

Contrary to some modern fantasy depictions of Mithraic rituals, these did not contain any bathing of the initiates in the blood of a bull slaughtered above their head, over a hole in the ceiling of the mithraeum. This is the description of a Christian writer, [[Prudentius]], who was attacking the pagan ritual of the [[Taurobolium]], associated with the cult of [[Cybele|Magna Mater]], not of Mithras. Even in that context, modern scholars tend to dismiss Prudentius' text as hearsay and Christian propaganda.

Reliefs on a cup found in [[Mainz]],&lt;ref name="Beck_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel|last=Beck|first=Roger|year=2000|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|issue=90|pages=145–180|doi=10.2307/300205|volume=90|jstor=300205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1995/108pdf/108001.pdf {{cite journal|title=Das Mainzer Mithrasgefäß|last=Merkelbach|first=Reinhold|year=1995|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|issue=108|pages=1–6}}]&lt;/ref&gt; appear to depict a Mithraic initiation. On the cup, the initiate is depicted as being led into a location where a ''Pater'' would be seated in the guise of Mithras with a drawn bow. Accompanying the initiate is a [[mystagogue]], who explains the symbolism and theology to the initiate. The Rite is thought to re-enact what has come to be called the ‘Water Miracle’, in which Mithras fires a bolt into a rock, and from the rock now spouts water.

Roger Beck has hypothesized a third processional Mithraic ritual, based on the Mainz cup and Porphyrys. This scene, called ‘Procession of the Sun-Runner’, shows the ''Heliodromus'' escorted by two figures representing Cautes and Cautopates (see below) and preceded by an initiate of the grade ''Miles'' leading a ritual enactment of the solar journey around the mithraeum, which was intended to represent the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Martin|first=Luther H.|year=2004|title=Ritual Competence and Mithraic Ritual}} in {{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Brian C.|title=Religion as a human capacity: a festschrift in honor of E. Thomas Lawson|year=2004|publisher=BRILL}}, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, it has been argued that most Mithraic rituals involved a re-enactment by the initiates of episodes in the Mithras narrative,&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.62–101.&lt;/ref&gt; a narrative whose main elements were: birth from the rock, striking water from stone with an arrow shot, the killing of the bull, Sol's submission to Mithras, Mithras and Sol feasting on the bull, the ascent of Mithras to heaven in a chariot. A noticeable feature of this narrative (and of its regular depiction in surviving sets of relief carvings) is the absence of female personages (the sole exception being [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] watching the 
tauroctony in the upper corner opposite [[Helios]]).&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
Only male names appear in surviving inscribed membership lists. Historians including Cumont and Richard Gordon have concluded that the cult was for men only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cumont | first1 = Franz | title = The Mysteries of Mithras | year = 1903 | page = 173 | url = https://archive.org/stream/mysteriesofmythr00cumouoft#page/n193/mode/2up | accessdate = 6 July 2011 | quote = Whilst the majority of the Oriental cults accorded to women a considerable role in their churches, and sometimes even a preponderating one, finding in them ardent supporters of the faith, Mithra forbade their participation in his Mysteries and so deprived himself of the incalculable assistance of these propagandists. The rude discipline of the order did not permit them to take the degrees in the sacred cohorts, and, as among the Mazdeans of the Orient, they occupied only a secondary place in the society of the faithful. Among the hundreds of inscriptions that have come down to us, not one mentions either a priestess, a woman initiate, or even a donatress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author= Richard Gordon| editor = Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Of Religion | title = Mithraism | edition = Second | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomas Gale, Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 9 | pages = 6090 | quote = ...Moreover, not a single woman is listed: the repeated attempts to show that women might belong to the cult are wishful thinking (Piccottini, 1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient scholar [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] refers to female initiates in Mithraic rites.&lt;ref name="geden 1"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Porphyry moreover seems to be the only writer who makes reference to women initiates into the service and rites of Mithra, and his allusion is perhaps due to a misunderstanding.... The participation of women in the ritual was not unknown in the Eastern cults, but the predominant military influence in Mithraism seems to render it unlikely in this instance.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th-century historian A.{{nbsp}}S. Geden writes that this may be due to a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name="geden 1"/&gt; According to Geden, while the participation of women in the ritual was not unknown in the Eastern cults, the predominant military influence in Mithraism makes it unlikely in this instance.&lt;ref name="geden 1"/&gt; It has recently been suggested by David Jonathan that "Women were involved with Mithraic groups in at least some locations of the empire."&lt;ref name="David_2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Jonathan|title=The Exclusion of Women in the Mithraic Mysteries: Ancient or Modern?|journal=Numen|volume=47|issue=2|year=2000|pages=121–141|doi=10.1163/156852700511469}}, at p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers were strongly represented amongst Mithraists, and also merchants, customs officials and minor bureaucrats. Few, if any, initiates came from leading aristocratic or senatorial families until the 'pagan revival' of the mid-4th century; but there were always considerable numbers of freedmen and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Clauss suggests that a statement by Porphyry, that people initiated into the Lion grade must keep their hands pure from everything that brings pain and harm and is impure, means that moral demands were made upon members of congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', pp.{{nbsp}}144–145: "Justin’s charge does at least make clear that Mithraic commandments did exist."&lt;/ref&gt; A passage in the ''Caesares'' of Julian the Apostate refers to "commandments of Mithras".&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.{{nbsp}}144, referencing ''Caesares'' 336C in the translation of W.{{nbsp}}C. Wright. Hermes addresses Julian: "As for you ...&amp;nbsp;, I have granted you to know Mithras the Father. Keep his commandments, thus securing for yourself an anchor-cable and safe mooring all through your life, and, when you must leave the world, having every confidence that the god who guides you will be kindly disposed."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], in his treatise "On the Military Crown" records that Mithraists in the army were officially excused from wearing celebratory coronets on the basis of the Mithraic initiation ritual that included refusing a proffered crown, because "their only crown was Mithras".&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De Corona Militis'', 15.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of Roman Mithraism===
The origins and spread of the Mysteries have been intensely debated among scholars and there are radically differing views on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beck | first1 = Roger | title = Religious Rivalries in the Early Roman Empire and the Rise of Christianity | chapter = On Becoming a Mithraist New Evidence for the Propagation of the Mysteries | editors = Leif E.

The earliest physical remains of the cult date from around the end of the 1st&amp;nbsp;Century&amp;nbsp;CE, and Mithraism reached its height of popularity in the third century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Daniels, whether any of this relates to the origins of the mysteries is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Daniels, "The role of the Roman army in the spread and practice of Mithraism" in John R. Hinnells (ed.) ''Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies'', Manchester University Press (1975), vol.&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;250: "Traditionally there are two geographical regions where Mithraism first struck root in the Roman empire: Italy and the Danube. Italy I propose to omit, as the subject needs considerable discussion, and the introduction of the cult there, as witnessed by its early dedicators, seems not to have been military. Before we turn to the Danube, however, there is one early event (rather than geographical location) which should perhaps be mentioned briefly in passing. This is the supposed arrival of the cult in Italy as a result of Pompey the Great’s defeat of the Cilician pirates, who practised ‘strange sacrifices of their own ... and celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithra continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them’. Suffice it to say that there is neither archaeological nor allied evidence for the arrival of Mithraism in the West at that time, nor is there any ancient literary reference, either contemporary or later. If anything, Plutarch’s mention carefully omits making the point that the cult was introduced into Italy at that time or by the pirates."&lt;/ref&gt; The unique underground temples or mithraea appear suddenly in the archaeology in the last quarter of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R.

====Earliest archaeology====
Inscriptions and monuments related to the Mithraic Mysteries are catalogued in a two volume work by Maarten J. Vermaseren, the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae]]'' (or [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Vermaseren|first=M. J.&lt;!--Maarten Jozef--&gt;|title=Corpus inscriptionum et monumentorum religionis mithriacae|series=2 vols.|location=The Hague|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|origyear=1956|year=1960|ref=CIMRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest monument showing Mithras slaying the bull is thought to be [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;593, found in Rome.  There is no date, but the inscription tells us that it was dedicated by a certain Alcimus, steward of T. Claudius Livianus. Vermaseren and Gordon believe that this Livianus is a certain Livianus who was commander of the Praetorian guard in 101&amp;nbsp;CE, which would give an earliest date of 98&amp;ndash;99&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Richard L.|title=The date and significance of CIMRM&amp;nbsp;593 (British Museum, Townley Collection|journal=Journal of Mithraic Studies II|year=1978|pages=148&amp;ndash;174}}.

[[File:Stela funerara MItra MNIR.JPG|thumb|Votive altar from [[Alba Iulia]] in present-day Romania, dedicated to ''Invicto Mythrae'' in fulfillment of a vow ''([[votum]])'']]Five small terracotta plaques of a figure holding a knife over a bull have been excavated near [[Kerch]] in the [[Crimea]], dated by Beskow and Clauss to the second half of the 1st&amp;nbsp;Century&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Beskow, Per, "The routes of early Mithraism", in ''Études mithriaques'', Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin (ed.). p.&amp;nbsp;14: "Another possible piece of evidence is offered by five terracotta plaques with a tauroctone, found in Crimea and taken into the records of Mithraic monuments by Cumont and Vermaseren. If they are Mithraic, they are certainly the oldest known representations of Mithras tauroctone; the somewhat varying dates given by Russian archaeologists will set the beginning of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;C.E. as a ''terminus ad quem'', which is also said to have been confirmed by the stratigraphic conditions."  Note&amp;nbsp;20 gives the publication as W. Blawatsky / G. Kolchelenko, ''Le culte de Mithra sur la cote spetentrionale de la Mer Noire'', Leiden 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;14f.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Beck to 50&amp;nbsp;BCE&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;CE. These may be the earliest tauroctonies, if they are accepted to be a depiction of Mithras.&lt;ref&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the area [the Crimea] is of interest mainly because of the terracotta plaques from Kerch (five, of which two are in [[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]] as numbers&amp;nbsp;11 and 12). These show a bull-killing figure and their probable date (second half of 1st&amp;nbsp;Century&amp;nbsp;BCE to first half of 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD) would make them the earliest tauroctonies &amp;ndash; if it is Mithras that they portray. Their iconography is significantly different from that of the standard tauroctony (e.g. in the [[Attis]]-like exposure of the god's genitals). Roger Beck, ''Mithraism since Franz Cumont'', ''Aufsteig und Niedergang der romischen Welt'', II&amp;nbsp;17.4 (1984), p.&amp;nbsp;2019 [https://books.google.com/books?id=wFceDNFgVowC&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=beck%20%22mithraism%20since%20franz%20cumont%22&amp;pg=PA2018#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true]&lt;/ref&gt; The bull-slaying figure wears a Phrygian cap, but is described by Beck and Beskow as otherwise unlike standard depictions of the tauroctony. Another reason for not connecting these artifacts with the Mithraic Mysteries is that the first of these plaques was found in a woman's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Beskow, Per, ''The routes of early Mithraism'', in ''Études mithriaques'' Ed. Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin. p.&amp;nbsp;15: "The plaques are typical Bosporan terracottas ... At the same time it must be admitted that the plaques have some strange features which make it debatable if this is really Mithra(s). Most striking is the fact that his genitals are visible as they are in the iconography of Attis, which is accentuated by a high anaxyrides. Instead of the tunic and flowing cloak he wears a kind of jacket, buttoned over the breast with only one button, perhaps the attempt of a not so skillful artist to depict a cloak. The bull is small and has a hump and the tauroctone does not plunge his knife into the flank of the bull but holds it lifted. The nudity gives it the character of a fertility god and if we want to connect it directly with the Mithraic mysteries it is indeed embarrassing that the first one of these plaques was found in a woman's tomb." Clauss, p.&amp;nbsp;156: "He is grasping one of the bull’s horns with his left hand, and wrenching back its head; the right arm is raised to deliver the death-blow. So far, this god must be Mithras. But in sharp contrast with the usual representations [of Mithras], he is dressed in a jacket-like garment, fastened at the chest with a brooch, which leaves his genitals exposed &amp;ndash; the iconography typical of Attis."&lt;/ref&gt;

An altar or block from near SS. Pietro e Marcellino on the Esquiline in Rome was inscribed with a bilingual inscription by an Imperial freedman named T. Flavius Hyginus, probably between 80&amp;ndash;100&amp;nbsp;CE. It is dedicated to ''Sol Invictus Mithras''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Richard L.|title=The date and significance of CIMRM 593 (British Museum, Townley Collection|journal=Journal of Mithraic Studies II|year=1978|pages=148–174}}.

Flavius Aug. lib. Hyginus | Ephebianus | d. d. &amp;ndash; but the Greek title is just "`Hliwi Mithrai". The name "Flavius" for an imperial freedman dates it between 70&amp;ndash;136&amp;nbsp;CE. The Greek section refers to a ''pater'' of the cult named Lollius Rufus, evidence of the existence of the rank system at this early date.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]&amp;nbsp;2268 is a broken base or altar from Novae/Steklen in Moesia Inferior, dated 100&amp;nbsp;CE, showing Cautes and Cautopates.

Other early archaeology includes the Greek inscription from Venosia by Sagaris ''actor'' probably from 100&amp;ndash;150&amp;nbsp;CE; the Sidon ''cippus'' dedicated by Theodotus priest of Mithras to Asclepius, 140&amp;ndash;141&amp;nbsp;CE; and the earliest military inscription, by C.&amp;nbsp;Sacidius Barbarus, centurion of XV Apollinaris, from the bank of the Danube at [[Carnuntum]], probably before 114&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Gordon_1978&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Richard L.|title=The date and significance of CIMRM&amp;nbsp;593 (British Museum, Townley Collection|journal=Journal of Mithraic Studies II|year=1978|pages=148&amp;ndash;174}} p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to C.M.Daniels, the Carnuntum inscription is the earliest Mithraic dedication from the Danube region, which along with Italy is one of the two regions where Mithraism first struck root.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Daniels, "The Roman army and the spread of Mithraism" in John R. Hinnels, ''Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2, 1975, Manchester University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;249&amp;ndash;274. "The considerable movement [of civil servants and military] throughout the empire was of great importance to Mithraism, and even with the very fragmentary and inadequate evidence that we have it is clear that the movement of troops was a major factor in the spread of the cult. Traditionally there are two geographical regions where Mithraism first struck root: Italy and the Danube. Italy I propose to omit, as the subject needs considerable discussion, and the introduction of the cult there, as witnessed by its early dedicators, seems not to have been military. Before we turn to the Danube, however, there is one early event (rather than geographical location) which should perhaps be mentioned briefly in passing. This is the supposed arrival of the cult in Italy as a result of Pompey the Great's defeat of Cilician pirates, who practiced ‘strange sacrifices of their own ... and celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithras continue to the present time, have been first instituted by them’." (ref. Plutarch, ''Pompey'' 24&amp;ndash;25) Suffice it to say that there is neither archaeological nor allied evidence for the arrival of Mithraism in the west at that time, nor is there any ancient literary reference, either contemporary or later. If anything, Plutarch’s mention carefully omits making the point that the cult was introduced into Italy at that time or by the pirates. Turning to the Danube, the earliest dedication from that region is an altar to ‘Mitrhe’&amp;nbsp;([[sic]]) set up by C. Sacidus Barbarus, a centurion of XV&amp;nbsp;Appolinaris, stationed at the time at Carnuntum in Pannonia (Deutsch-Altenburg, Austria). The movements of this legion are particularly informative." The article then goes on to say that XV&amp;nbsp;Appolinaris was originally based at Carnuntum, but between 62&amp;ndash;71&amp;nbsp;CE transferred to the east, first in the Armenian campaign, and then to put down the Jewish uprising. Then 71&amp;ndash;86 back in Carnuntum, then 86&amp;ndash;105 intermittently in the Dacian wars, then 105&amp;ndash;114 back in Carnuntum, and finally moved to Cappadocia in 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest dateable mithraeum outside Rome dates from 148&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Daniels, "The Roman army and the spread of Mithraism" in John R. Hinnels, ''Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2, 1975, Manchester University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;263. The first dateable Mithraeum outside Italy is from Böckingen on the Neckar, where a centurion of the legion VIII&amp;nbsp;Augustus dedicated two altars, one to Mithras and the other (dated 148) to Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mithraeum at Caesarea Maritima is the only one in Palestine and the date is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis M. Hopfe, "Archaeological indications on the origins of Roman Mithraism", in Lewis M. Hopfe (ed). ''Uncovering ancient stones: essays in memory of H. Neil Richardson'', Eisenbrauns (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;147&amp;ndash;158&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;. p.&amp;nbsp;153: "At present this is the only Mithraeum known in Roman Palestine." p.&amp;nbsp;154: "It is difficult to assign an exact date to the founding of the Caesarea Maritima Mithraeum. No dedicatory plaques have been discovered that might aid in the dating. The lamps found with the ''taurectone'' medallion are from the end of the first century to the late 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE. Other pottery and coins from the vault are also from this era. Therefore, it is speculated that this Mithraeum developed toward the end of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century and remained active until the late 3rd&amp;nbsp;Century. This matches the dates assigned to the Dura-Europos and the Sidon Mithraea."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earliest cult locations====

===Classical literature about Mithras and the Mysteries===
[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Mithras and the Bull: This fresco from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, Italy (third century) shows the ''tauroctony'' and the celestial lining of Mithras' cape.]]
According to Boyce, the earliest literary references to the mysteries are by the Latin poet Statius, about 80&amp;nbsp;CE, and Plutarch (c.&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Boyce | first1 = Mary | last2 = Grenet | first2 = Frantz | title = Zoroastrianism under Macedonian and Roman rule, Part 1 | publisher = Brill | year = 1975 | pages = 468, 469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWiMV6llZesC&amp;lpg=PA472&amp;dq=inauthor%3Amary%20inauthor%3Aboyce%20mithra&amp;pg=PA468#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor:mary%20inauthor:boyce%20mithra&amp;f=true | accessdate = 2011-03-16 | isbn = 90-04-09271-4 |quote=... the Persian affiliation of the Mysteries is acknowledged in the earliest literary reference to them. This is by the Latin poet Statius who, writing about 80&amp;nbsp;CE., described Mithras as one who "twists the unruly horns beneath the rocks of a Persian cave". Only a little later (c.&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;CE.) Plutarch attributed an Anatolian origin to the Mysteries, for according to him the Cilician pirates whom Pompey defeated in 67&amp;nbsp;BCE. "celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithras continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statius====
The [[Thebaid]] (c.&amp;nbsp;80&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;ref name="ulanseystatius"/&gt;) an epic poem by [[Statius]], pictures Mithras in a cave, wrestling with something that has horns.&lt;ref&gt;Statius: Thebaid&amp;nbsp;1.719 to 720 [http://www.theoi.com/Text/StatiusThebaid1.html J.H.Mozey's translation at Classical E-Text] [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/statius/theb1.shtml Latin text at The Latin Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The context is a prayer to the god [[Phoebus]].&lt;ref&gt;The prayer begins at Statius Thebaid&amp;nbsp;1.696 [http://www.theoi.com/Text/StatiusThebaid1.html J.H.Mozey's translation at Classical E-Text] [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/statius/theb1.shtml Latin text at The Latin Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The cave is described as ''persei'', which in this context is usually translated ''Persian''; however, according to the translator J.{{nbsp}}H.

====Plutarch====
The Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (46&amp;ndash;127&amp;nbsp;AD) says that "secret mysteries ... of Mithras" were practiced by the pirates of [[Cilicia]], the coastal province in the southeast of [[Anatolia]], who were active in the 1st&amp;nbsp;Century&amp;nbsp;BCE: "They likewise offered strange sacrifices; those of Olympus I mean; and they celebrated certain secret mysteries, among which those of Mithras continue to this day, being originally instituted by them."&lt;ref name="Life of Pompey 24"&gt;([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#24 ''Life of Pompey'' 24], referring to events c.&amp;nbsp;68&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions that the pirates were especially active during the [[Mithridatic wars]] (between the [[Roman Republic]] and King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]) in which they supported the king.&lt;ref name="Life of Pompey 24"/&gt; The association between Mithridates and the pirates is also mentioned by the ancient historian [[Appian]].&lt;ref&gt;App. ''Mith''&amp;nbsp;14.92 cited in {{Cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|title=Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1991|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506788-6|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th&amp;nbsp;century commentary on [[Vergil]] by [[Servius]] says that [[Pompey]] settled some of these pirates in [[Calabria]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;E.D.&amp;nbsp;Francis "Plutarch's Mithraic pirates", an appendix to the article by Franz Cummont "The Dura Mithraeum" in John R. Hinnells ''Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the first international congress'' Vol&amp;nbsp;1, pp.&amp;nbsp;207&amp;ndash;210. Manchester University Press, 1975. (The reference to ''Servius'' is in a lengthy footnote to page&amp;nbsp;208.)

====Dio Cassius====
The historian [[Dio Cassius]] (2nd to 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD) tells how the name of Mithras was spoken during the state visit to Rome of [[Tiridates I of Armenia]], during the reign of [[Nero]]. (Tiridates was the son of [[Vonones II of Parthia]], and his coronation by Nero in 66 CE confirmed the end of a war between [[Parthia]] and Rome.) Dio Cassius writes that Tiridates, as he was about to receive his crown, told the Roman emperor that he revered him "as Mithras".&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 63.5.2&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Beck thinks it possible that this episode contributed to the emergence of Mithraism as a popular religion in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism | title = Mithraism | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | last = Beck | first = Roger | date =2002-07-20 | publisher = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition | quote = In the Cumontian scenario this episode cannot mark the definitive moment of transfer, for Mithraism in that scenario was already established in Rome, albeit on a scale too small to have left any trace in the historical or archaeological record. Nevertheless, it could have been a spur to Mithraism’s emergence on to the larger stage of popular appeal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porphyry====
[[File:Roman - Fragment of a Mosaic with Mithras - Walters 437.jpg|thumb|Mosaic (1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD) depicting Mithras emerging from his cave and flanked by Cautes and Cautopates ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
The philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (3rd&amp;ndash;4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD) gives an account of the origins of the Mysteries in his work ''De antro nympharum'' (The Cave of the Nymphs).&lt;ref name="deantro2"/&gt; Citing Eubulus as his source, Porphyry writes that the original temple of Mithras was a natural cave, containing fountains, which [[Zoroaster]] found in the mountains of Persia. To Zoroaster, this cave was an image of the whole world, so he consecrated it to Mithras, the creator of the world. Later in the same work, Porphyry links Mithras and the bull with planets and star-signs: Mithras himself is associated with the sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] and the planet [[Mars]], while the bull is associated with [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_cave_of_nymphs_02_translation.htm De antro nympharum] 11:&amp;nbsp;"Hence, a place near to the equinoctial circle was assigned to Mithra as an appropriate seat. And on this account he bears the sword of Aries, which is a martial sign. He is likewise carried in the Bull, which is the sign of Venus. For Mithra. as well as the Bull, is the Demiurgus and lord of generation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Porphyry is writing close to the demise of the cult, and Robert Turcan has challenged the idea that Porphyry's statements about Mithraism are accurate. His case is that far from representing what Mithraists believed, they are merely representations by the Neoplatonists of what it suited them in the late 4th century to read into the mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, Robert, ''Mithras Platonicus'', Leiden, 1975, via Beck, R. ''Merkelbach's Mithras'' pp.&amp;nbsp;301&amp;ndash;302.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Merkelbach and Beck believe that Porphyry’s work "is in fact thoroughly coloured with the doctrines of the Mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R. ''Merkelbach’s Mithras'' p.&amp;nbsp;308 n.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck holds that classical scholars have neglected Porphyry’s evidence and have taken an unnecessarily skeptical view of Porphyry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Beck|author2=Luther H.

====Mithras Liturgy====
In later antiquity, the Greek name of Mithras (''Μίθρας''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) occurs in the text known as the "[[Mithras Liturgy]]", a part of the ''[[Greek Magical Papyri|Paris Greek Magical Papyrus]]'' (Paris Bibliothèque Nationale Suppl. gr.&amp;nbsp;574);  here Mithras is given the epithet "the great god", and is identified with the sun god [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Marvin | title = The historical Jesus in context | chapter = The Mithras Liturgy | editors = A.J.

Scholarship on Mithras begins with [[Franz Cumont]], who published a two volume collection of source texts and images of monuments in French in 1894&amp;nbsp;1900, ''Textes et monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mithra'' [French: ''Texts and Illustrated Monuments Relating to the Mysteries of Mithra''].&lt;ref&gt;Cumont, Franz (1894&amp;ndash;1900).

====Criticisms and reassessments of Cumont====
Cumont's theories came in for severe criticism from John R. Hinnells and R.L. Gordon at the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies held in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|title=Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1991|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506788-6|page=10|quote=In the course of the First International Congress, two scholar in particular presented devastating critiques of Cumont's Iranian hypothesis ... One, John Hinnells, was the organizer of the conference ... Of more importance in the long run, however, was the even more radical paper presented by R.L.Gordon&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hinnells was unwilling to reject entirely the idea of Iranian origin,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells, "Reflections on the bull-slaying scene" in ''Mithraic studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eBy8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mithraic%20studies&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q=Since%20Cumont's%20reconstruction%20&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;303&amp;ndash;304]: "Nevertheless we would not be justified in swinging to the opposite extreme from Cumont and Campbell and denying all connection between Mithraism and Iran."&lt;/ref&gt; but wrote: "we must now conclude that his reconstruction simply will not stand. It receives no support from the Iranian material and is in fact in conflict with the ideas of that tradition as they are represented in the extant texts. Above all, it is a theoretical reconstruction which does not accord with the actual Roman iconography."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells, "Reflections on the bull-slaying scene" in ''Mithraic studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eBy8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mithraic%20studies&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q=Since%20Cumont's%20reconstruction%20&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;303&amp;ndash;304]:&amp;nbsp;"Since Cumont’s reconstruction of the theology underlying the reliefs in terms of the Zoroastrian myth of creation depends upon the symbolic expression of the conflict of good and evil, we must now conclude that his reconstruction simply will not stand. It receives no support from the Iranian material and is in fact in conflict with the ideas of that tradition as they are represented in the extant texts. Above all, it is a theoretical reconstruction which does not accord with the actual Roman iconography. What, then, do the reliefs depict? And how can we proceed in any study of Mithraism? I would accept with R.&amp;nbsp;Gordon that Mithraic scholars must in future start with the Roman evidence, not by outlining Zoroastrian myths and then making the Roman iconography fit that scheme. ... Unless we discover Euboulus’ history of Mithraism we are never likely to have conclusive proof for any theory. Perhaps all that can be hoped for is a theory which is in accordance with the evidence and commends itself by (mere) plausibility."&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed Cumont’s reconstruction of the bull-slaying scene and stated "that the portrayal of Mithras given by Cumont is not merely unsupported by Iranian texts but is actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells, "Reflections on the bull-slaying scene" in ''Mithraic studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;292: "Indeed, one can go further and say that the portrayal of Mithras given by Cumont is not merely unsupported by Iranian texts but is actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology. Cumont reconstructs a primordial life of the god on earth, but such a concept is unthinkable in terms of known, specifically Zoroastrian, Iranian thought where the gods never, and apparently never could, live on earth. To interpret Roman Mithraism in terms of Zoroastrian thought and to argue for an earthly life of the god is to combine irreconcilables. If it is believed that Mithras had a primordial life on earth, then the concept of the god has changed so fundamentally that the Iranian background has become virtually irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper by R.L.&amp;nbsp;Gordon argued that Cumont severely distorted the available evidence by forcing the material to conform to his predetermined model of Zoroastrian origins. Gordon suggested that the theory of Persian origins was completely invalid and that the Mithraic mysteries in the West was an entirely new creation.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.Gordon, "Franz Cumont and the doctrines of Mithraism" in John R. Hinnells (ed.), ''Mithraic studies'', vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;215 f&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has been expressed by Luther H. Martin: "Apart from the name of the god himself, in other words, Mithraism seems to have developed largely in and is, therefore, best understood from the context of Roman culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Martin|first=Luther H.|year=2004|title=Foreword}} in {{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Roger B.|title=Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays|year=2004|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-4081-7}}, p.&amp;nbsp;xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Hopfe, "All theories of the origin of Mithraism acknowledge a connection, however vague, to the Mithra/Mitra figure of ancient [[Aryan]] religion."&lt;ref name="RichardsonHopfe1994-4"/&gt; Reporting on the Second International Congress of Mithraic Studies, 1975, Ugo Bianchi says that although he welcomes "the tendency to question in historical terms the relations between Eastern and Western Mithraism", it "should not mean obliterating what was clear to the Romans themselves, that Mithras was a 'Persian' (in wider perspective: an Indo-Iranian) god."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/clas/ejms/out_of_print/JMSv1n1/JMSv1n1Bianchi.pdf | title = The Second International Congress of Mithraic Studies, Tehran, September&amp;nbsp;1975 | accessdate = 2011-03-20 | last = Bianchi | first = Ugo | quote = I welcome the present tendency to question in historical terms the relations between Eastern and Western Mithraism, which should not mean obliterating what was clear to the Romans themselves, that Mithras was a ‘Persian’ (in wider perspective: an Indo-Iranian) god.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Boyce|Boyce]] states that "no satisfactory evidence has yet been adduced to show that, before Zoroaster, the concept of a supreme god existed among the Iranians, or that among them [[Mithra]] &amp;ndash; or any other divinity &amp;ndash; ever enjoyed a separate cult of his or her own outside either their ancient or their Zoroastrian pantheons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|year=2001|title=Mithra the King and Varuna the Master|journal=Festschrift für Helmut Humbach zum 80|location=Trier|publisher=WWT}} pp. 243, n.18&lt;!--(239–257)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also says that although recent studies have minimized the Iranizing aspects of the self-consciously Persian religion "at least in the form which it attained under the Roman Empire", the name ''Mithras'' is enough to show "that this aspect is of some importance". She also says that "the Persian affiliation of the Mysteries is acknowledged in the earliest literary references to them."&lt;ref name="boyceonname"/&gt;

Beck tells us that since the 1970s scholars have generally rejected Cumont, but adds that recent theories about how Zoroastrianism was during the period BCE now make some new form of Cumont's east-west transfer possible.&lt;ref name="beckonzoroastrianism"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Roger B.|title=Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays|year=2004|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-4081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIYTfTYrs1UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=beck%20on%20mithraism&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=generally%20agreed%20that%20Cumont's%20master%20narrative%20of%20east-west%20transfer%20is%20unsustainable&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;28]: "Since the 1970s scholars of western Mithraism have generally agreed that Cumont's master narrative of east-west transfer is unsustainable"; although he adds that "recent trends in the scholarship on Iranian religion, by modifying the picture of that religion prior to the birth of the western mysteries, now render a revised Cumontian scenario of east-west transfer and continuities now viable."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that

&lt;blockquote&gt;... an indubitable residuum of things Persian in the Mysteries and a better knowledge of what constituted actual Mazdaism have allowed modern scholars to postulate for Roman Mithraism a continuing Iranian theology. This indeed is the main line of Mithraic scholarship, the Cumontian model which subsequent scholars accept, modify, or reject. For the transmission of Iranian doctrine from East to West, Cumont postulated a plausible, if hypothetical, intermediary: the Magusaeans of the Iranian diaspora in Anatolia. More problematic &amp;ndash; and never properly addressed by Cumont or his successors &amp;ndash; is how real-life Roman Mithraists subsequently maintained a quite complex and sophisticated Iranian theology behind an occidental facade. Other than the images at Dura of the two 'magi' with scrolls, there is no direct and explicit evidence for the carriers of such doctrines. ... Up to a point, Cumont’s Iranian paradigm, especially in Turcan’s modified form, is certainly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beck | first1 = Roger | title = The Religion of the Mithras cult in the Roman empire | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | location = Great Britain | pages = 48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-12-08.html | title = Roger Beck, The Religion of the Mithras Cult in the Roman Empire: Mysteries of the Unconquered Sun.

His emphasis on the Iranian features of the cult is now less influential with the Iranising influences generally played down in scholarship over the last thirty years.

====Modern theories====
[[File:Musei Vaticani - Mithra - Sol invictus 01136.JPG|thumb|300px|Bas-relief depicting the tauroctony. Mithras is depicted looking to Sol Invictus as he slays the bull. Sol and Luna appear at the top of the relief.]]

Beck theorizes that the cult was created in Rome, by a single founder who had some knowledge of both Greek and Oriental religion, but suggests that some of the ideas used may have passed through the Hellenistic kingdoms. He observes that "Mithras &amp;ndash; moreover, a Mithras who was identified with the Greek Sun god [[Helios]]" was among the gods of the syncretic Greco-Armenian-Iranian royal cult at [[Mount Nemrut|Nemrut]], founded by [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Commagene]] in the mid 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="Beck_2002"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Beck|first=Roger|year=2002|title=Mithraism|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism|accessdate=2007-10-28|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda Pub|quote=Mithras &amp;ndash; moreover, a Mithras who was identified with the Greek Sun god Helios &amp;ndash; was one of the deities of the syncretic Graeco-Iranian royal cult founded by Antiochus&amp;nbsp;I ([[Antiochus I|q.v.]]), king of the small but prosperous buffer state of Commagene ([[Commagene|q.v.]]) in the mid 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While proposing the theory, Beck says that his scenario may be regarded as Cumontian in two ways. Firstly, because it looks again at Anatolia and Anatolians, and more importantly, because it hews back to the methodology first used by Cumont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://azargoshnasp.net/Din/mysteriesofmithra.pdf | title = The mysteries of Mithras: A new account of their genesis | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Beck | first = Roger  | quote = ...&amp;nbsp;It may properly be called a ‘Cumontian scenario’ for two reasons: First, because it looks again to Anatolia and Anatolians; Secondly, and more importantly, because it hews to the methodological line first set by Cumont.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkelbach suggests that its mysteries were essentially created by a particular person or persons&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R., 2002: "Discontinuity’s weaker form of argument postulates re-invention among and for the denizens of the Roman empire (or certain sections thereof), but re-invention by a person or persons of some familiarity with Iranian religion in a form current on its western margins in the first century CE. Merkelbach (1984: pp.&amp;nbsp;75&amp;ndash;77), expanding on a suggestion of M. P. Nilsson, proposes such a founder from eastern [[Anatolia]], working in court circles in Rome. So does Beck (1998), with special focus on the dynasty of Commagene (see above). Jakobs 1999 proposes a similar scenario."&lt;/ref&gt; and created in a specific place, the city of Rome, by someone from an eastern province or border state who knew the [[Iranian myths]] in detail, which he wove into his new grades of initiation; but that he must have been Greek and Greek-speaking because he incorporated elements of Greek [[Platonism]] into it. The myths, he suggests, were probably created in the milieu of the imperial bureaucracy, and for its members.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Merkelbach, ''Mithras'', Konigstein, 1984, ch.&amp;nbsp;75&amp;ndash;77&lt;/ref&gt; Clauss tends to agree. Beck calls this "the most likely scenario" and states "Until now, Mithraism has generally been treated as if it somehow evolved [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Other characters|Topsy]]-like from its Iranian precursor &amp;ndash; a most implausible scenario once it is stated explicitly."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R., "Merkelbach's Mithras", pp.&amp;nbsp;304, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist Lewis M. Hopfe notes that there are only three mithraea in [[Roman Syria]], in contrast to further west. He writes: "Archaeology indicates that Roman Mithraism had its epicenter in Rome ... the fully developed religion known as Mithraism seems to have begun in Rome and been carried to Syria by soldiers and merchants."&lt;ref name="hopfe-5"&gt;Lewis M. Hopfe, "Archaeological indications on the origins of Roman Mithraism", in Lewis M. Hopfe (ed). ''Uncovering ancient stones: essays in memory of H. Neil Richardson'', Eisenbrauns (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;147&amp;ndash;158. p.&amp;nbsp;156: "Beyond these three Mithraea [in Syria and Palestine], there are only a handful of objects from Syria that may be identified with Mithraism. Archaeological evidence of Mithraism in Syria is therefore in marked contrast to the abundance of Mithraea and materials that have been located in the rest of the Roman Empire. Both the frequency and the quality of Mithraic materials is greater in the rest of the empire. Even on the western frontier in [[Great Britain|Britain]], archaeology has produced rich Mithraic materials, such as those found at Walbrook.

If one accepts Cumont’s theory that Mithraism began in Iran, moved west through [[Babylon]] to [[Asia Minor]], and then to Rome, one would expect that the cult left its traces in those locations. Instead, archaeology indicates that Roman Mithraism had its epicenter in Rome. Wherever its ultimate place of origin may have been, the fully developed religion known as Mithraism seems to have begun in Rome and been carried to Syria by soldiers and merchants. None of the Mithraic materials or temples in Roman Syria except the Commagene sculpture bears any date earlier than the late first or early second century. [''footnote in cited text:''&amp;nbsp;30. Mithras, identified with a Phrygian cap and the nimbus about his head, is depicted in colossal statuary erected by King Antiochus&amp;nbsp;I of Commagene, 69&amp;ndash;34&amp;nbsp;BCE. (see Vermaseren, ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum Religionis Mithriacae|CIMRM]]'' 1.53&amp;ndash;56). However, there are no other literary or archaeological evidences to indicate that the religion of Mithras as it was known among the Romans in the second to fourth centuries&amp;nbsp;AD was practiced in Commagene]. While little can be proved from silence, it seems that the relative lack of archaeological evidence from Roman Syria would argue against the traditional theories for the origins of Mithraism."&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a different view from other modern scholars, Ulansey argues that the Mithraic mysteries began in the Greco-Roman world as a religious response to the discovery by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of the astronomical phenomenon of the [[precession of the equinoxes]] &amp;ndash; a discovery that amounted to discovering that the entire cosmos was moving in a hitherto unknown way. This new cosmic motion, he suggests, was seen by the founders of Mithraism as indicating the existence of a powerful new god capable of shifting the cosmic spheres and thereby controlling the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Ulansey, D., ''The origins of the Mithraic mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;77f.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Adrian David Hugh Bivar|A. D. H. Bivar]], L. A. Campbell and G. Widengren have variously argued that Roman Mithraism represents a continuation of some form of Iranian Mithra worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism | title = Mithraism | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | last = Beck | first = Roger | date =2002-07-20 | publisher = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition | quote =  The time has come to review the principal scholarship which has argued for transmission and continuity based on the postulated similarities ... three argue for continuity in the strongest terms. A.D.H.&amp;nbsp;Bivar (1998, and earlier studies mentioned there) argues that western Mithraism was but one of several manifestations of Mithra-worship current in antiquity across a wide swathe of Asia and Europe. L.A.&amp;nbsp;Campbell (1968) argues in the Cumontian tradition ... extraordinarily detailed and learned form of Zoroastrian Mazdaism. A continuity as thoroughgoing, though not quite so systematic ideologically, was proposed in several studies by G. Widengren (1965: pp.&amp;nbsp;222&amp;ndash;232; 1966; 1980).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Antonia Tripolitis, Roman Mithraism originated in [[Vedic India]] and picked up many features of the cultures which it encountered in its westward journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonía Tripolitis|title=Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman age|year=2002|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4913-7|pages=3–|quote=It originated in Vedic, India, migrated to Persia by way of Babylon, and then westward through the Hellenized East, and finally across the length and breadth of the Hellenistic-Roman world. On its westward journey, it incorporated many of the features of the cultures in which it found itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Speidel, who specializes in military history, associates Mithras with the Sun god [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Michael P.

===Later history===
[[File:Sol Invictus staue in Milan Archeology Museum IMG 4874 1.JPG|thumb|Sol Invictus from the [[Archaeological Museum of Milan]] (Museo archeologico)]]

The first important expansion of the mysteries in the Empire seems to have happened quite quickly, late in the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (b.&amp;nbsp;121&amp;nbsp;CE, d.&amp;nbsp;161&amp;nbsp;CE) and under [[Marcus Aurelius]].  By this time all the key elements of the mysteries were in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Richard L.|title=The date and significance of CIMRM 593 (British Museum, Townley Collection|journal=Journal of Mithraic Studies II|year=1978|pages=148–174}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;150&amp;ndash;151: "The first important expansion of the mysteries in the Empire seems to have occurred relatively rapidly late in the reign of Antoninus Pius and under Marcus Aurelius&amp;nbsp;(9). By that date, it is clear, the mysteries were fully institutionalised and capable of relatively stereotyped self-reproduction through the medium of an agreed, and highly complex, symbolic system reduced in iconography and architecture to a readable set of 'signs'. Yet we have good reason to believe that the establishment of at least some of those signs is to be dated at least as early as the Flavian period or in the very earliest years of the second century. Beyond that we cannot go&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraism reached the apogee of its popularity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, spreading at an "astonishing" rate at the same period when the worship of [[Sol Invictus]] was incorporated into the state-sponsored cults.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R., ''Merkelbach's Mithras'', p.299; Clauss, R., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;25: "...&amp;nbsp;the astonishing spread of the cult in the later 2nd and early 3rd&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;AD ... This extraordinary expansion, documented by the archaeological monuments&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;  At this period a certain Pallas devoted a monograph to Mithras, and a little later Euboulus wrote a ''History of Mithras'', although both works are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, R., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;25, referring to Porphyry, ''De Abstinentia'', 2.56 and 4.16.3 (for Pallas) and ''De antro nympharum''&amp;nbsp;6 (for Euboulus and his history).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 4th&amp;nbsp;century [[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]], the emperor [[Commodus]] participated in its mysteries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loeb|first=D. Magie|title=Scriptores Historiae Augustae: Commodus|year=1932}} pp. IX.6: ''Sacra Mithriaca homicidio vero polluit, cum illic aliquid ad speciem timoris vel dici vel fingi soleat'' "He desecrated the rites of Mithras with actual murder, although it was customary in them merely to say or pretend something that would produce an impression of terror".&lt;/ref&gt; but it never became one of the state cults.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;24: "The cult of Mithras never became one  of those supported by the state with public funds, and was never admitted to the official list of festivals celebrated by the state and army &amp;ndash; at any rate as far as the latter is known to us from the ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', the religious calendar of the units at Dura-Europos in Coele Syria;" [where there was a Mithraeum] "the same is true of all the other mystery cults too."  He adds that at the individual level, various individuals did hold roles both in the state cults and the priesthood of Mithras.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] writes:{{quote|Mithras is the guide of souls which he leads from the earthly life into which they had fallen back up to the light from which they issued ... It was not only from the religions and the wisdom of Orientals and Egyptians, even less from Christianity, that the notion that life on earth was merely a transition to a higher life was derived by the Romans. Their own anguish and the awareness of senescence made it plain enough that earthly existence was all hardship and bitterness. Mithras-worship became one, and perhaps the most significant, of the religions of redemption in declining paganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burckhardt|first1=Jacob|title=The Age of Constantine the Great|date=1852|publisher=Univ California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04680-1|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Persecution and Christianization===
The religion and its followers faced persecution in the 4th century from [[Christianization]], and Mithraism came to an end at some point between its last decade and the 5th century. Ulansey states that "Mithraism declined with the rise to power of Christianity, until the beginning of the fifth century, when Christianity became strong enough to exterminate by force rival religions such as Mithraism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.well.com/user/davidu/mithras.html | title = The Cosmic Mysteries of Mithras | accessdate = 2011-03-20 | last = Ulansey | first = David | quote = Mithraism declined with the rise to power of Christianity, until the beginning of the fifth century, when Christianity became strong enough to exterminate by force rival religions such as Mithraism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Speidel, Christians fought fiercely with this feared enemy and suppressed it during the late 4th{{nbsp}}century. Mithraic sanctuaries were destroyed and religion was no longer a matter of personal choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=As a mystery religion it engulfed the Roman empire during the first four centuries of our era. Mithraic sanctuaries are found from Roman Arabia to Britain, from the Danube to the Sahara, wherever the Roman soldier went. Christian apologetics fiercely fought the cult they feared., and during the late 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE, as a victim of the Judaeo-Christian spirit of intolerance, Roman Mithraism was suppressed, its sanctuaries destroyed together with the last vestiges of religious freedom in the empire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luther H. Martin, Roman Mithraism came to an end with the anti-pagan decrees of the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] during the last decade of the 4th{{nbsp}}century.&lt;ref name="collectedworks"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Luther H. | last2 = Beck | first2 = Roger | title = Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays | chapter = Foreword | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | date = December 30, 2004 | pages = xiii| isbn = 978-0-7546-4081-3 | quote = However, the cult was vigorously opposed by Christian polemicists, especially by Justin and Tertullian, because of perceived similarities between it and early Christianity.

Clauss states that inscriptions show Mithras as one of the cults listed on inscriptions by [[Roman senate|Roman senators]] who had not converted to Christianity, as part of the "pagan revival" among the elite in the second half of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', pp.&amp;nbsp;29&amp;ndash;30: "Mithras also found a place in the ‘pagan revival’ that occurred, particularly in the western empire, in the latter half of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE. For a brief period, especially in Rome, the cult enjoyed, along with others, a last efflorescence, for which we have evidence from among the highest circles of the senatorial order. One of these senators was Rufius Caeionius Sabinus, who in 377 dedicated an altar" to a long list of gods that includes Mithras.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck states that "Quite early in the [fourth] century the religion was as good as dead throughout the empire."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R., ''Merkelbach's Mithras'', p.&amp;nbsp;299.&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological evidence indicates the continuance of the cult of Mithras up until the end of the 4th{{nbsp}}century. In particular, large numbers of votive coins deposited by worshippers have been recovered at the Mithraeum at Pons Sarravi (Sarrebourg) in Gallia Belgica, in a series that runs from [[Gallienus]] (r. 253–268) to [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–395). These were scattered over the floor when the mithraeum was destroyed, as Christians apparently regarded the coins as polluted; therefore, providing reliable dates for the functioning of the mithraeum up until near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', pp.{{nbsp}}31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Cumont states that Mithraism may have survived in certain remote cantons of the Alps and Vosges into the 5th{{nbsp}}century.&lt;ref name="Cumont_Mysteries"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cumont|first=Franz|title=The Mysteries of Mithra|editor=McCormack, Thomas J. (trans.)|year=1903|location=Chicago|publisher=Open Court|isbn=0-486-20323-9}} [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/mom/mom09.htm pp. 206]: "A few clandestine conventicles may, with stubborn persistence, have been held in the subterranean retreats of the palaces. The cult of the Persian god possibly existed as late as the fifth century in certain remote cantons of the Alps and the Vosges. For example, devotion to the Mithraic rites long persisted in the tribe of the Anauni, masters of a flourishing valley, of which a narrow defile closed the mouth."  This is unreferenced; but the French text in ''Textes et monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mithra'' tom.{{nbsp}}1, p.{{nbsp}}348 has a footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Humphries, the deliberate concealment of Mithraic cult objects in some areas suggests that precautions were being taken against Christian attacks. However, in areas like the [[Rhine]] frontier, barbarian invasions may have also played a role in the end of Mithraism.&lt;ref name="HarveyHunter2008"&gt;{{cite book

At some of the mithraeums that have been found below churches, such as the Santa Prisca Mithraeum and the [[Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano|San Clemente]] Mithraeum, the ground plan of the church above was made in a way to symbolize Christianity's domination of Mithraism.&lt;ref name="churchmithraeum"&gt;{{cite book

Clemente.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cult disappeared earlier than that of [[Isis]]. Isis was still remembered in the Middle Ages as a pagan deity, but Mithras was already forgotten in [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.{{nbsp}}171.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[John, the Lord Chamberlain]]", a 1999–2014 series of [[historical mystery]] novels, depicts a secret Mithraist community still active in [[Justinian]]'s court (r. 527–567), but there is no historical evidence for such a late survival of the religion.

==Interpretations of the bull-slaying scene==
[[File:Museul de istorie IMG 1703Siboiumithra 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Unusual tauroctony at the [[Brukenthal National Museum]]]]

According to Cumont, the imagery of the tauroctony was a Graeco-Roman representation of an event in Zoroastrian cosmogony described in a 9th-century Zoroastrian text, the [[Bundahishn]]. In this text the evil spirit [[Ahriman]] (not Mithra) slays the primordial creature [[Gavaevodata]], which is represented as a bovine.&lt;ref&gt;The Greater [Bundahishn] [http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb1.htm#chap4 IV.19-20]: "19.&amp;nbsp;He let loose Greed, Needfulness, [Pestilence,] Disease, Hunger, Illness, Vice and Lethargy on the body of Gav' and Gayomard. 20.&amp;nbsp;Before his coming to the 'Gav', Ohrmazd gave the healing Cannabis, which is what one calls 'banj', to the' Gav' to eat, and rubbed it before her eyes, so that her discomfort, owing to smiting, [sin] and injury, might decrease; she immediately became feeble and ill, her milk dried up, and she passed away."&lt;/ref&gt; Cumont held that a version of the myth must have existed in which Mithras, not Ahriman, killed the bovine. But according to Hinnells, no such variant of the myth is known, and that this is merely speculation: "In no known Iranian text [either Zoroastrian or otherwise] does Mithra slay a bull."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hinnels|first=John R.|chapter=Reflections on the bull-slaying scene|title=Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Mithraic Studies|publisher=Manchester UP|pages=II.290–312}}, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ulansey finds astronomical evidence from the mithraeum itself.&lt;ref name="Ulansey_1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulansey|first=David|year=1989|title=The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-505402-4}} (1991 revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt; He reminds us that the Platonic writer [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] wrote in the 3rd{{nbsp}}century CE that the cave-like temple Mithraea depicted "an image of the world"&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_cave_of_nymphs_02_translation.htm ''De Antro nympharum''] 10:&amp;nbsp;"Since, however, a cavern is an image and symbol of the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and that Zoroaster consecrated a cave resembling the world fabricated by Mithras.&lt;ref name="deantro2"&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_cave_of_nymphs_02_translation.htm De antro nympharum] 2:&amp;nbsp;"For, as Eubulus says, Zoroaster was the first who consecrated in the neighbouring mountains of Persia, a spontaneously produced cave, florid, and having fountains, in honour of Mithra, the maker and father of all things; |12&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;cave, according to Zoroaster, bearing a resemblance of the world, which was fabricated by Mithra. But the things contained in the cavern being arranged according to commensurate intervals, were symbols of the mundane elements and climates."&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling of the Caesarea Maritima Mithraeum retains traces of blue paint, which may mean the ceiling was painted to depict the sky and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis M.

[[File:Mithras banquet Louvre Ma3441.jpg|thumb|Sol and Mithras banqueting with Luna and the twin divinities Cautes and Cautopates, his attendants (side{{nbsp}}B of a double-sided Roman marble relief, 2nd or 3rd{{nbsp}}century CE)]]
Ulansey has proposed that Mithras seems to have been derived from the [[Perseus (constellation)|constellation of Perseus]], which is positioned just above Taurus in the night sky. He sees iconographic and mythological parallels between the two figures: both are young heroes, carry a dagger, and wear a Phrygian cap. He also mentions the similarity of the image of Perseus killing the [[Gorgon]] and the tauroctony, both figures being associated with underground caverns and both having connections to Persia as further evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ulansey, D., ''The origins of the Mithraic mysteries'', p.{{nbsp}}25–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Speidel associates Mithras with the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] because of the proximity to Taurus, and the consistent nature of the depiction of the figure as having wide shoulders, a garment flared at the hem, and narrowed at the waist with a belt, thus taking on the form of the constellation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

Beck has criticized Speidel and Ulansey of adherence to a literal cartographic logic, describing their theories as a "will-o'-the-wisp" that "lured them down a false trail".&lt;ref name="Beck_2004"&gt;Beck, Roger, "In the place of the lion: Mithras in the tauroctony" in ''Beck on Mithraism: collected works with new essays'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIYTfTYrs1UC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=ulansey+mithras+sol+luna&amp;ei=IDHPSs-HNJPuygS3xdiGBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulansey%20mithras%20sol%20luna&amp;f=false p. 270–276].&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a literal reading of the tauroctony as a star chart raises two major problems: it is difficult to find a constellation counterpart for Mithras himself (despite efforts by Speidel and Ulansey) and that, unlike in a star chart, each feature of the tauroctony might have more than a single counterpart. Rather than seeing Mithras as a constellation, Beck argues that Mithras is the prime traveller on the celestial stage (represented by the other symbols of the scene), the Unconquered Sun moving through the constellations.&lt;ref name="Beck_2004"/&gt; But again, Meyer holds that the Mithras Liturgy reflects the world of Mithraism and may be a confirmation for Ulansey's theory of Mithras being held responsible for the precession of equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Marvin | title = The historical Jesus in context | chapter = The Mithras Liturgy | editors = A.J.

With the leg of the bull, interpreted astronomically, the Mithraic god, or Mithras, turns the sphere of heaven around, and if the text suggests that Mithras "moves heaven and turns it back (antistrephousa)," Mithras may be responsible for the astronomical precession of the equinoxes, the progressive change in the earth's orientation in space caused by a wobble in the earth's rotation (so Ulansey).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of Mithras was part of the [[syncretism|syncretic]] nature of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. Almost all Mithraea contain statues dedicated to gods of other cults, and it is common to find inscriptions dedicated to Mithras in other sanctuaries, especially those of Jupiter Dolichenus.&lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M., ''The Roman cult of Mithras'', p.{{nbsp}}158.&lt;/ref&gt; Mithraism was not an alternative to Rome's other traditional religions, but was one of many forms of religious practice, and many Mithraic initiates can also be found participating in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|civic religion]], and as initiates of other mystery cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|year=1987|title=Ancient Mystery Cults|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03387-6|page= 49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill, 2008, pp.{{nbsp}}202–203: "Many people have erroneously supposed that all religions have a sort of universalist tendency or ambition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6595">'''The Nara Document on Authenticity''' is a document that addresses the need for a broader understanding of [[cultural diversity]] and [[cultural heritage]] in relation to conservation in order to evaluate the value and authenticity of [[Cultural heritage#Cultural property|cultural property]] more objectively.&lt;ref&gt;The Getty Conservation Institute, [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/research_resources/charters/charter55.html "The Nara Document on Authenticity, ICOMOS Symposia"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was drafted by 45 representatives from 28 countries after their deliberation on the definition and assessment of authenticity during the Nara Conference held in [[Nara, Japan|Nara]] in November 1994.

Such a conference was first suggested by [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]] during the 16th meeting of the [[World Heritage Committee]]. The Japanese government took up the initiative and organized the Conference jointly with [[UNESCO]], [[International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property|ICCROM]] and ICOMOS.&lt;ref name="Report on the Conference"&gt;UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/1994/whc-94-conf003-inf8e.pdf "Report on the Conference on authenticity in relation to the World Heritage Convention"]&lt;/ref&gt; The experts attending the Conference reached a consensus that "authenticity is an essential element in defining, assessing, and monitoring cultural heritage." They recognized the concept and application of the term "authenticity" actually vary from culture to culture. Therefore, when authenticity is being assessed for a particular cultural heritage, its underlying cultural context should be considered.&lt;ref name="Report on the Conference"/&gt;

Before the Conference had actually started, the countries had only hoped to achieve the widening of the range of attributes that are used to assess the authenticity of cultural properties; particularly for the Government of Japan to legitimize their practice of periodic dismantle, rebuilding, repair and re-assemble of wooden heritage structures. In the end, it had not only produced a broader technical framework for authenticity analysis; but also clarified a number of long-standing delusions that had limited the scope of the application of "authenticity" to assist practical decision-making in heritage conservation field.
&lt;ref name="Origins and Influence"&gt;Herb Stovel, "Origins and Influence of the Nara Document on Authenticity", ''APT Bulletin'' 39, no. 2/3, 2008 p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Document==
The Nara Document is a short document that contains four main sections, they are:

===Preamble===
In this part, it is indicated that the Nara Document stemmed from the [[Venice Charter]] of 1964. The Document was intended to build upon it and enlarge its scope to accommodate the rapidly growing number of concerns around and interests in cultural heritage. It is stressed that "the essential contribution made by the consideration of authenticity in conservation practice is to clarify and illuminate the collective memory of humanity."

===Cultural Diversity and Heritage Diversity===
It is recognized that diversity in culture and heritage provide substance to all mankind. Hence such diversity should be advanced as an invaluable aspect of human development. As different cultures have different belief systems and a wide array of tangible and intangible ways to express and transmit them, it is imperative for them to respect each other, especially when one or more values are in conflict. One of the main principles of UNESCO, the universal nature and values of cultural heritage, is also stressed here.

===Values and Authenticity===
When a cultural heritage is being conserved, it is the values that have been bestowed upon by "all its forms and historical periods" that are being conserved. In order to make those values understandable, the heritage itself must be credible. Apart from letting ordinary people understand heritage, ensuring the authenticity of cultural heritage is also instrumental for scholarly studies, in "conservation and restoration planning," and in the inscription procedures of heritage sites on the [[World Heritage List]].

Because of the fact that the notion of what constitute values and credibility vary from culture to culture, it is of utmost importance that cultural heritage must be judged and evaluated according to the respective cultures they belong. A wide range of sources of information is encouraged to be looked-into when judging a cultural heritage's authenticity, such as design, materials and functions. They can in turn shed lights on different dimensions of the cultural heritage, like historic and social.

===Appendixes===
In the two appendixes of the Document, suggestions made on follow-up actions are documented. For example, to facilitate more international cooperation and dialogue, raising public's awareness towards the topic. The definitions of the term "conservation" and "information sources" are also given here.

(for details please refer to the original document by following the link under the "External Links" section)

==Evolution of Authenticity in Cultural Heritage==
The word "authenticity" first appearance in an international conservation-related document is in the Venice Charter. It states that reconstruction of heritage sites is not allowed while only the reassembly of the originals is permissible. Even in the early versions of the World Heritage Convention's Operational Guidelines, it was stated that 'cultural properties must "meet the test of authenticity in design, materials, worksmanship, and setting"'.&lt;ref name="An Introduction"&gt;Pamela Jerome, "An Introduction to Authenticity in Preservation", ''APT Bulletin'' 39, no. 2/3, 2008 p.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Nara Conference, the concept of "progressive authenticities", which means the layers of history that a cultural property has acquired through time are being considered authentic attributes of that cultural property, has been confirmed.&lt;ref name="An Introduction"/&gt; A short sentence written by [[David Lowenthal]] is precise and clear in describing this concept. It goes as '"Authenticity is in practice never absolute, always relative."'&lt;ref&gt;David Lowenthal, "Changing Criteria of Authenticity," in "An Introduction to Authenticity in Preservation", Pamela Jerome, ''APT Bulletin'' 39, no. 2/3, 2008 p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.
** [[Theatre]] ([[Outline of theatre|outline]]) &amp;ndash; collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place.
** [[Music]] ([[Outline of music|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form the medium of which is sound and silence.
** [[Opera]] ([[List of opera topics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Stagecraft]] ([[Outline of stagecraft|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).
* [[Linguistics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of linguistics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of natural languages.
* [[Psychology]] &amp;nbsp; research of psychological pathology and therapeutic treatments separate from, but complementary to, [[Psychiatry|psychiatric medicine]]
* [[Sociology]] &amp;nbsp; study of social interaction between and among groups of people
* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.

=== Interdisciplinary humanities ===
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary approach to studying a geographic area.
* [[Ecological humanities]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the humanities over the past several decades (in particular environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology).
* Ethno-cultural studies, such as: [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies]], and other programs that take an interdisciplinary approach to ethno-cultural research
* [[Gender studies]] &amp;nbsp; interdisciplinary investigation of gender roles in culture, economics, business, politics, medicine, fine arts, media, etc.
* [[Library studies]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Women's studies]] &amp;nbsp; interdisciplinary study of the roles of women and ways of defining and redefining the feminine identity

=== Applied humanities ===
* [[Applied arts]] &amp;nbsp; such as [[fashion design]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]]
* [[Health humanities]] &amp;ndash; application of humanities disciplines to discourse about, expression of, or the promotion of the dimensions of human health and well being.
* [[Medical humanities]] &amp;ndash; is an interdisciplinary field of medicine which includes the humanities and their application to medical education and practice.

== General humanities methodologies ==

'''Paragrammatism''' is the confused or incomplete use of grammatical structures, found in certain forms of speech disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/paragrammatism |title=Definition of paragrammatism |format= |work=Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paragrammatism is the inability to form [[Grammar|grammatically correct]] sentences. It is characteristic of [[fluency|fluent]] [[aphasia]], most commonly [[Receptive aphasia]]. Paragrammatism is sometimes called "extended paraphasia," although it is different from [[paraphasia]]. Paragrammatism is roughly synonymous with "[[word salad]]," which concerns the semantic coherence of speech rather than its production.

==Cause==
Huber assumes a disturbance of the sequential organization of sentences as the cause of the syntactic errors (1981:3). Most students and practitioners regard paragrammatism as the morphosyntactic "leitsymptom" of Wernicke’s aphasia.

However, ever since the introduction of the term paragrammatism some students have
pointed out that paragrammatic and [[Agrammatism|agrammatic]] phenomena, which in classical theory form
part of Broca’s aphasia, may co-occur in the same patient.&lt;ref name="Butterworth"/&gt;

==History==
Since Kleist introduced the term in 1916,&lt;ref name="Heeschen, Kolk, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heeschen|first1=Claus|last2=Kolk|first2=Herman|title=Agrammatism and paragrammatism|journal=Aphasiology|volume=2|issue=3–4|year=1988|pages=299–302|issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/02687038808248928}}&lt;/ref&gt; paragrammatism denotes a disordered mode of
expressing oneself that is characterized by confused and erroneous word order, syntactic
structure and/or grammatical morphology &lt;ref name="Butterworth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterworth|first1=Brian|last2=Howard|first2=David|title=Paragrammatisms|journal=Cognition|volume=26|issue=1|year=1987|pages=1–37|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90012-6|pmid=3608394}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Schlenck 1991:199f)

Most researchers suppose that the faulty syntactic structure (sentence blends,
contaminations, break-offs) results from a disturbance of the syntactic plan of the utterance
(de Bleser/Bayer 1993:160f)

In non-fluent aphasia, oral expression is often agrammatic, i.e. grammatically incomplete and/or incorrect. By contrast, expression in fluent aphasia usually appears grammatical, albeit with disruptions in content. Despite this persistent impression, errors of sentence structure and morphology do occur in fluent aphasia, although they take the form of substitutions rather than omissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/archive/00001925/ |title=Understanding paragrammatism: A comparative case study |format= |work=Aphasiology (2008)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minneapolis City Hall.jpg|thumb|Copper roof on the [[Minneapolis City Hall]], coated with patina]]
[[File:FraunkircheSouth.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]]. The church was destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden]] in 1945 and then rebuilt 1993–2005 with new material; the stones with the black patina are the parts that survived the firebombing from the original 18th-century church.]]

'''Patina''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|ᵻ|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|t|iː|n|ə}}) is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and similar [[metals]] ([[tarnish]] produced by oxidation or other chemical processes), or certain [[stone|stones]], &lt;ref name="AssemblyPřikryl2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=European Geosciences Union. General Assembly |last2=Přikryl |first2=Richard |last3=Smith |first3=Bernard J. |author4=Geological Society of London |title=Building Stone Decay: From Diagnosis to Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NS5PaO_LeQC&amp;pg=PA295 |accessdate=26 September 2012 |year=2007 |publisher=Geological Society |isbn=978-1-86239-218-2 |pages=295–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wooden [[furniture]] (sheen produced by age, wear, and polishing), or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure. 

Additionally, leather aficionados use the term to describe the ageing of high quality leather. The patina on leather goods are unique to the type of leather, frequency of use, and exposure. 

Patinas can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering. They may also be aesthetically appealing.

==Usage==
On metal, patina is a coating of various chemical compounds such as [[oxide]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[sulfide]]s, or [[sulfate]]s formed on the surface during exposure to atmospheric elements ([[oxygen]], [[rain]], [[acid rain]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur]]-bearing compounds), a common example of which is rust which forms on iron or steel when exposed to oxygen. Patina also refers to accumulated changes in surface texture and colour that result from normal use of an object such as a [[coin]] or a piece of furniture over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aboutcoppersinks.org/ |title= Finish issues with regard to copper sinks |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeologist]]s also use the term ''"patina''" to refer to a [[corticate]]d layer that develops over time that is due to a range of complex factors on [[flint]] tools and ancient stone monuments.&lt;ref name="AssemblyPřikryl2007"/&gt; This has led stone tool analysts in recent times to generally prefer the term ''"cortification"'' as a better term to describe the process than ''"patination"''.&lt;ref name="Edmonds1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=Mark |title=Stone Tools and Society: Working Stone in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFxCq5Ez77UC&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=26 September 2012 |date=2 June 1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-21449-0 |pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]] and [[geomorphology]], the term ''"patina''" is used to refer to discolored film or thin outer layer produced either on or within the surface of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or other material by either the development of a [[weathering rind]] within the surface of a rock, the formation of  [[desert varnish]] on the surface of a rock, or combination of both. It also refers to development as the result of weathering of a case-hardened layer, called ''"cortex''" by geologists, within the surface of either a flint or [[chert]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]].&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P.

==Etymology==
The word "patina" comes from the Latin for "shallow dish". Figuratively, ''patina'' can refer to any fading, darkening or other signs of age, which are felt to be natural or unavoidable (or both).

The chemical process by which a patina forms or is deliberately induced is called patination, and a work of art coated by a patina is said to be patinated.

The green patina that forms naturally on [[copper]] and bronze, sometimes called [[verdigris]], usually consists of varying mixtures of copper [[copper(II) chloride|chloride]]s, [[copper sulfide|sulfide]]s, [[copper sulfate|sulfates]] and [[copper(II) carbonate|carbonate]]s, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;Oxidation Reaction: Why is the Statue of Liberty Blue-Green?

In industrial and urban air environments containing sulfurous [[acid rain]] from coal-fired power plants or industrial processes, the final patina is primarily composed of sulphide or sulphate compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berg |first=Jan |title=Why did we paint the library's roof? |url=http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm |accessdate=2007-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625065039/http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm |archivedate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Architectural considerations; Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/arch_considerations.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Larry E. (2004). Preventing corrosion on copper roofing systems; Professional Roofing, October 2004, http://www.professionalroofing.net&lt;/ref&gt;

A patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. Buildings in damp coastal/marine environments will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry inland areas.

Facade cladding ([[copper cladding]]; [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding|copper wall cladding]]) with alloys of copper, e.g. brass or bronze, will weather differently from "pure" copper cladding. Even a lasting gold colour is possible with copper-alloy cladding, for example [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol, or the [[Novotel]] at Paddington Central, London.

Often, antique and well-used firearms will develop a patina on the steel after the [[bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[parkerizing]], or other finish has worn. Firearms in this state are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re-blued or parkerized. The patina protects the firearm from the more damaging rust that would occur were the patina to be polished off.

==Applied patina==
{{See also|Copper in architecture#Finishes}}
Artists and metalworkers often deliberately add patinas as a part of the original design and decoration of art and furniture, or to simulate antiquity in newly made objects.  The process is often called [[distressing]].

A wide range of chemicals, both household and commercial, can give a variety of patinas. They are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color, texture, or both. Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine the color of the patina. For copper alloys, such as bronze, exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulfur compounds (such as "[[liver of sulfur]]") tend to brown. The basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like [[ammonium sulfide]] (blue-black), liver of sulfur (brown-black), [[cupric nitrate]] (blue-green) and [[ferric nitrate]] (yellow-brown). For artworks, patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, greens, whites, reds and various blacks. Some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals.  Sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing, oiling, or other types of lacquers or clear-coats.  More simply, the French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] used to instruct assistants at his studio to urinate over bronzes stored in the outside yard.  A patina can be produced on copper by the application of vinegar ([[acetic acid]]). This patina is water-soluble and will not last on the outside of a building like a "true" patina. It is usually used as pigment.

Patina is also found on [[slip ring]]s and [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]s. This type of patina is formed by corrosion, what elements the air might hold, residue from the wear of the carbon brush and moisture; thus, the patina needs special conditions to work as intended.

Patinas can also be found in woks or other metal baking dishes, which form when properly seasoned. The patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been burned onto it to prevent food sticking and to enhance the flavor of the foods cooked in it. Steaming foods or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust.

Knife collectors that own carbon steel blades sometimes force a patina onto the blade to help protect it and give it a more personalized look. This can be done using various chemicals and substances such as muriatic acid, apple cider vinegar, or mustard. It can also be done by sticking the blade into any acidic vegetable or fruit such as an orange or an apple.

==Repatination==
In the case of antiques, a range of views are held on the value of patination and its replacement if damaged, known as repatination.

Preserving a piece's look and character is important and removal or reduction may dramatically reduce its value. If patination has flaked off, repatination may be recommended.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/lasvegas_200706A35.html |title=What "Patina" Really Means |last=Gaffney |first=Dennis |date=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appraiser Reyne Haines notes that a repatinated metal piece will be worth more than one with major imperfections in the patina, but less than a piece still with its original finish.&lt;ref name=Gaffney/&gt;

'''Piman''' (or '''Tepiman''') refers to a group of languages within the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family that are spoken by ethnic groups (including the [[Pima people|Pima]]) spanning from Arizona in the north to [[Durango]], [[Mexico]] in the south.

The Piman languages are as follows (Campbell 1997):

: 1. '''[[O'odham language|O'odham]]''' (also known as Pima language, Papago language)
: 2. '''[[Pima Bajo language|O'ob]]''' (also known as Mountain Pima, Lowland Pima)
: 3. '''[[Tepehuán language|O'otham]]''' (also known as Tepehuán proper, Southwestern Tepehuán, Southeastern Tepehuán)
: 4. '''[[Tepecano language|Tepecano]]''' ''(†)''

==Morphology==
Piman languages are [[agglutinative]], where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several [[morpheme]]s strung together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">In [[sociology]] and especially the [[sociology of religion|sociological study of religion]], '''plausibility structures''' are the sociocultural contexts for systems of meaning within which these meanings make sense, or are made plausible. Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.

==Origins==

The term was coined by [[Peter L. Berger]], who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[G. H. Mead]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967) p. 45 and p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social "world" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.

==Decline of religious plausibility==

Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.change.freeuk.com/learning/socthink/berger.html Peter Berger's ''the Homeless Mind'' thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Berger considered that history "constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was "an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1971) p. 121 and p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wuthnow, ''Rediscovering the Sacred'' (1992) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected [[reference group]]s in maintaining one's plausibility structures,&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology (2007) p. 319-20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Phillips/D. L. Okholm, ''Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shrubland Hall Anglo-Saxon cemetery''' is a 7th-century [[Anglo-Saxon]] burial site discovered at Shrubland Hall Quarry near [[Coddenham]], [[Suffolk]].

A '''Single Screen''' game perspective can apply to all video games in which the entire playfield is shown on the screen, and the player character is unable to move beyond the boundaries of the screen either to a) scroll the game world (e.g. [[Mappy]]), or b) move to a different screen (e.g. [[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Diorama (game perspective)|diorama]] perspective, which refers to non-screen based games ([[shooting range#Shooting gallery|shooting galleries]], [[pinball]] and other mechanical games) which were popular before and during the early years of video games. Also not to be confused with hybrid perspective games such as Caveman (Gottlieb), and [[Boot Hill (video game)|Boot Hill]] (Midway), which because of their dual camera nature are harder to classify into one perspective.

==History==
Single Screen video games became popular in the early 1970s with [[Pong]]. They offered a simpler and more affordable alternative to the expensive electro mechanical games of the time (such as Sega's Periscope).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon and Beyond : the Story Behind the Craze that Touched Our Lives and Changed the World|url = https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ultimate_History_of_Video_Games.html?id=C2MH05ogU9oC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher = Prima Pub.|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780761536437|language = en|first = Steve L.|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: from Pong to Pokemon and beyond...the story behind the craze that touched our li ves and changed the world|url = https://books.google.co.za/books?id=PTrcTeAqeaEC&amp;pg=PT469&amp;lpg=PT469&amp;dq=periscope++sega+1295&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=amEv-8_Yfe&amp;sig=g-GkfQ8s4JjjzwuDKvFnFxb8Ojo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Crown/Archetype|date = 2010-06-16|isbn = 9780307560872|language = en|first = Steven|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of these early games though was their lack of color and three dimensional effects compared to other games like [[Sonar (arcade game)|Sonar]].
In spite of these limitations single screen games were made covering multiple genres, including racing ([[Gran Trak 10]]), vehicle combat ([[Tank (video game)|Tank]]), shooting galleries ([[Qwak!]]), evasion / collection ([[Shark Jaws]]), and multiplayer shooters ([[Western Gun]]). In contrast to Pinball though (which could offer many more minutes per play) these games were still lacking, due to either their timed play mechanics (through a clock or limited ammunition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tracer - Videogame by Sega|url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=12739|website = www.arcade-museum.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Arcade games to move beyond these limitations was [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]], and when it was released in 1976 it would go on to inspire [[Space Invaders]], the second game to offer a much longer play time than what was common in this game perspective. The next big evolution in this game perspective was then the introduction of multiple screen types ([[Donkey Kong]]) and randomized elements in combination with destructible environments ([[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]) to add not only duration, but greater variety in the single screen experience.

== Origins ==
{{main article|History of liberalism}}

=== Great Britain ===
[[File:Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse , c1910.jpg|thumb||upright|[[Leonard Hobhouse]]]]
By the end of the 19th century, the principles of [[classical liberalism]] were challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing awareness of poverty and unemployment present within modern industrial cities and also by the agitation of organized labour. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]]—became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. The new liberals tried to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied, as more positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an [[equal opportunity]] of success.&lt;ref name="eatwell"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Eatwell | first = Roger | authorlink = |author2=Wright, Anthony | title = Contemporary political ideologies | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 1999 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780826451736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Liberalism ====
[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Hill Green]]]]
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a group of British thinkers known as the New Liberals made a case against ''laissez-faire'' classical liberalism and argued in favor of state intervention in social, economic and cultural life. What they proposed is now called social liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Leonard Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams  |first=Ian |title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today) |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |isbn=0719060206 |year=2001 |location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge encyclopaedia of philosophy, p.599&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[H. H. Asquith]], especially thanks to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], established the foundations of the [[welfare state]] in the United Kingdom before the [[World War I|First World War]]. The comprehensive welfare state built in the United Kingdom after the Second World War, although largely accomplished by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], was significantly designed by two Liberals, namely [[John Maynard Keynes]] (who laid the economic foundations) and [[William Beveridge]] (who designed the welfare system).&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt;

Historian Peter Weiler has argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;Although still partially informed by older Liberal concerns for  character, self-reliance, and the capitalist market, this legislation nevertheless, marked a significant shift in Liberal approaches to the state and social reform, approaches that later governments would slowly expand and that would grow into the welfare state after the Second World War. What was new in these reforms was the underlying assumption that the state could be a positive force, that the measure of individual freedom... was not how much the state left people alone, but whether he gave them the capacity to fill themselves as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weiler, "New Liberalism" in Fred M. Leventhal, ed., ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995) pp 564-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weiler, ''The New Liberalism: Liberal Social Theory in Great Britain, 1889-1914'' (2016) [https://www.amazon.com/New-Liberalism-1889-1914-Routledge-Nineteenth/dp/1138696528 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Germany ===
In 1860s [[Germany]], "left-liberal" politicians like [[Max Hirsch (labor economist)|Max Hirsch]], [[Franz Duncker]] and [[Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch]] established [[trade union]]s—modeled on their British counterparts—in order to help workers improve working and economic conditions by means of reconciliation of interests and cooperation with their employers rather than class struggle. Schulze-Delitzsch is also known as the founding father of the German [[History of the cooperative movement|cooperative movement]] and is credited as the organiser of the world's first [[credit union]]s. Some liberal economists, such as [[Lujo Brentano]] or [[Gerhart von Schulze-Gävernitz]], established the ''[[Verein für Socialpolitik]]'' ("Social Policy Association") in 1873 to promote social reform based on the [[historical school of economics]] (and therefore rejecting [[classical economics]]), proposing a third way between [[Manchester Liberalism]] and socialist revolution.

However, their ideas found relatively few supporters among the liberal politicians. The main objectives of the "left-liberal" parties—the [[German Progress Party]] and its successors—were free speech, freedom of assembly, representative government, equal and secret suffrage, free trade and protection of private property while they were strongly opposed to the creation of a [[welfare state]], which they called "[[state socialism]]".

One of the first German authors to propose the term and concept of "social liberalism" ''(Sozialliberalismus)'' was the historian and economist [[Ignaz Jastrow]]. He published the manifesto ''"Social-liberal": Tasks for Liberalism in Prussia"'' (''"Sozialliberal": die Aufgaben des Liberalismus in Preußen'') in 1893. Jastrow, who was a member of the ''Verein für Socialpolitik'', and his supporters tried to found a social-liberal party, aimed at bringing together liberals who supported social reform and the [[Reformism|reformist]]/[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] wing of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], which should be a "workers' reform party" and "action group for people's right and people's welfare" ''(Waffenbund für Volksrecht und Volkswohlfahrt)''. However, this project was rejected by Social Democrats and failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Inho Na |title=Sozialreform oder Revolution: Gesellschaftspolitische Zukunftsvorstellungen im Naumann-Kreis 1890–1903/04 |publisher=Tectum Verlag |year=2003 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait Friedrich Naumann (ca. 1911).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Naumann]]]]
A similar project was the [[National-Social Association]] founded and led by the Protestant pastor [[Friedrich Naumann]], who maintained close contacts with Brentano and Schulze-Gävernitz as well as [[Max Weber]] who supported the party that was influenced by his political theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Joshua |last=Derman |title=Max Weber in Politics and Social Thought: From Charisma to Canonization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tried to draw workers away from [[Marxism]] by proposing a mix of social liberalism, nationalism, a non-Marxist variant of "socialism" and Protestant Christian values to overcome class antagonisms by non-revolutionary means. Naumann called this a "proletarian-bourgeois integral liberalism". Among other things, the new group advocated increased social welfare legislation, the right to strike and profit-sharing in industry. Although the party was unable to win any seats and soon dissolved, the theories it developed would remain influential in German liberalism.

The "left-liberal" [[German Democratic Party]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933) included both classically and economically liberal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Hans |last=Mommsen |title=The Rise and Fall of Weimar Democracy |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1996 |page=58 |isbn=0-8078-2249-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurlander"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Kurlander |title=The Price of Exclusion: Ethnicity, National Identity, and the Decline of German Liberalism, 1898–1933 |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2006 |page=197 |isbn=1-8454-5069-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and social liberal currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Liesbeth |last=Van De Grift |title=Securing the Communist State: The Reconstruction of Coercive Institutions in the Soviet Zone of Germany and Romania, 1944-48 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2012 |page=41 |isbn=978-0-7391-7178-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In [[France]], social liberal theory was developed in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] by [[Social solidarity|solidarist]] thinkers, including [[Alfred Fouillée]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], who were inspired by [[sociology]] and influenced radical politicians like [[Léon Bourgeois]]. They explained that a greater division of labor caused greater opportunity and individualism, but it also inspired a more complex interdependence. They argued that the individual had a debt to society, promoting progressive taxation to support public works and welfare schemes. However, they wanted the state to coordinate rather than to manage and they encouraged cooperative insurance schemes among individuals. Their main objective was to remove barriers to social mobility rather than create a welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary political ideologies'' (1999) Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{main article|Modern liberalism in the United States}}
[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the 32nd [[President of the United States]], whose [[New Deal]] domestic policies defined [[American liberalism]] for the middle third of the 20th century]]
In the 1870s and the 1880s, the American economists [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]], [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Henry Carter Adams]]—influenced both by [[socialism]] and the [[Evangelical Protestant]] movement—castigated the conditions caused by industrial factories and expressed sympathy towards [[labor unions]]. However, none developed a systematic political philosophy and they later abandoned their flirtations with socialist thinking. In 1883, [[Lester Frank Ward]] published the two-volume ''Dynamic Sociology'' and formalized the basic tenets of social liberalism while at the same time attacking the ''laissez-faire'' policies advocated by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. The historian [[Henry Steele Commager]] ranked Ward alongside [[William James]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] and called him the father of the modern welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele, ed.; Lester Ward and the Welfare State. New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Writing from 1884 until the 1930s, John Dewey—an educator influenced by Hobhouse, Green and Ward—advocated socialist methods to achieve liberal goals. Some social liberal ideas were later incorporated into the [[New Deal]],&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; which developed as a response to the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] came into office.

== Implementation ==
The welfare state grew gradually and unevenly from the late 19th century, but became fully developed following the World War II along with the [[Mixed economy|mixed market economy]]. Also called "[[embedded liberalism]]", social liberal policies gained broad support across the political spectrum, because they reduced the disruptive and polarizing tendencies in society, without challenging the capitalist economic system. Business accepted social liberalism in the face of widespread dissatisfaction with the [[boom and bust]] cycle of the earlier economic system as it seemed to them to be a lesser evil than more left-wing modes of government. Social liberalism was characterized by cooperation between big business, government and labor unions. Government was able to assume a strong role because its power had been strengthened by the wartime economy, but the extent to which this occurred varied considerably among Western democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|left|British leaflet from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] expressing support for the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Health Insurance Act of 1911]] and the legislation provided benefits to sick and unemployed workers, marking a major milestone in the development of [[social welfare]]]]
The first notable implementation of social liberal policies occurred under the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] in Britain from 1906 until 1914. These initiatives became known as the [[Liberal welfare reforms]]. The main elements included pensions for poor elderly people, [[National Insurance Act 1911|health, sickness and unemployment insurance]] based on earlier programs in Germany and the establishment of [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|labour exchanges]]. These changes were accompanied by [[progressive income tax|progressive taxation]], particularly in the [[People's Budget]] of 1909. The old system of charity—relying on the [[English Poor Laws|Poor laws]] and supplemented by private charity, public co-operatives and private insurance companies—was in crisis, giving the state added impetus for reform. The Liberal Party caucus elected in 1906 also contained more professionals, including academics and journalists, sympathetic to social liberalism. The large business owners had mostly deserted the Liberals for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], the latter becoming the favorite party for commercial interests. The reforms were regularly opposed by both business interests and trade unions. Liberals most identified with these reforms were Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[David Lloyd George]] (especially as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) and [[Winston Churchill]] (as [[President of the Board of Trade]]) in addition to the civil servant (and later Liberal MP) [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwanger, pp. 273-317&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties in Europe (notably including the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]) have taken on strong influences of social liberal ideology. Despite Britain's two major parties coming from the traditions of socialism and conservatism, most substantive political and economic debates of recent times were between social liberal and classical liberal concepts.&lt;ref name="Vincent_54"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Andrew Vincent |title=Modern Political Ideologies |edition=Third |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
[[File:Alexander Rüstow.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Rüstow]]]]
[[Alexander Rüstow]], a German economist, first proposed the German variant of economic social liberalism. In 1932, he applied the label "[[neoliberalism]]" to this kind of social liberalism while speaking at the [[Social Policy Association]], although that term now carries a meaning different from the one proposed by Rüstow. Rüstow wanted an alternative to socialism and to the classical liberal economics developed in the [[German Empire]]. In 1938, Rüstow met with a variety of economic thinkers—including the likes of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]] and [[Wilhelm Röpke|William Roepke]]—to determine how liberalism could be renewed. Rüstow advocated a strong state to enforce free markets and state intervention to correct market failures. However, Mises argued that monopolies and cartels operated because of state intervention and protectionism and claimed that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. He viewed Rüstow's proposals as negating market freedom and saw them as similar to socialism.&lt;ref name="cis.org.au"&gt;Oliver Marc Hartwich: [http://www.cis.org.au/temp/op114_neoliberalism.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Second World War, Rüstow's "neoliberalism", now usually called [[ordoliberalism]] or the [[social market economy]], was adopted by the West German government under [[Ludwig Erhard]], who was the Minister of Economics and later became Chancellor. Price controls were lifted and free markets were introduced. While these policies are credited with Germany's post-war economic recovery, the welfare state—which had been established under Bismarck—became increasingly costly.&lt;ref name="cis.org.au"/&gt;

=== Rest of Europe ===
The post-war governments of other countries in Western Europe also followed social liberal policies. These policies were implemented primarily by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] as liberal parties in Europe declined in strength from their peak in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
American political discourse resisted this social turn in European liberalism.  While the economic policies of the [[New Deal]] appeared Keynesian, there was no revision of liberal theory in favor of greater state initiative. Even though the United States lacked an effective socialist movement, New Deal policies often appeared radical and were attacked by the right. The separate development of [[modern liberalism in the United States]] is often attributed to [[American exceptionalism]], which kept mainstream American ideology within a narrow range.&lt;ref&gt;''Contending liberalisms in world politics: ideology and power'' (2001), James L. Richardson, pp. [https://www.google.com/books?id=FM_tCJk51yQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=contending%20liberalisms%20in%20world%20politics&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 38–41]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Rawls]]' principal work ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971) can be considered a flagship exposition of social liberal thinking, advocating the combination of individual freedom and a fairer distribution of resources. According to Rawls, every individual should be allowed to choose and pursue his or her own conception of what is desirable in life, while a [[Social justice|socially just]] distribution of goods must be maintained. Rawls argued that differences in material wealth are tolerable if general economic growth and wealth also benefit the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=gary Browning |title=Contemporary liberalism |work=Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of the Present |publisher=Sage |year=2000 |pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Theory of Justice'' countered [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] thinking in the tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]], instead following the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] concept of a [[social contract]], picturing society as a mutual agreement between [[Rationality|rational]] citizens, producing rights and duties as well as establishing and defining roles and tasks of the state. Rawls put the "equal liberty principle" in the first place, providing every person with equal access to the same set of [[Fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[Civil liberties|liberties]], followed by the "fair equality of opportunity" and "difference principle", thus allowing social and economic inequalities under the precondition that privileged positions are accessible to everyone, that everyone has equal opportunities and that even the least advantaged members of society benefit from this framework. This was later restated in the equation of ''[[Justice as Fairness]]''. Rawls proposed these principles not just to adherents of liberalism, but as a basis for all democratic politics, regardless of ideology. The work advanced social liberal ideas immensely within 1970s' political and philosophic academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwin van de Haar |title=Degrees of Freedom: Liberal Political Philosophy and Ideology |publisher=Transaction |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls may therefore be seen as a "patron saint" of social liberalism.&lt;ref name="Vincent_54"/&gt;

== Decline ==
Following economic problems in the 1970s, liberal thought underwent some transformation. Keynesian economic management was seen as interfering with the free market, while increased welfare spending that had been funded by higher taxes prompted fears of lower investment, lower consumer spending and the creation of a "dependency culture". Trade unions often caused high wages and industrial disruption, while full employment was regarded as unsustainable. Writers such as [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Samuel Brittan]], who were influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]], advocated a reversal of social liberalism. Their policies, which are often called [[neoliberalism]], had a significant influence on Western politics, most notably on the governments of United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and United States President [[Ronald Reagan]], who pursued policies of deregulation of the economy and reduction in spending on social services.&lt;ref name="Faulks"&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=FAtlVdPhEFAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Political%20Sociology%3A%20A%20Critical%20Introduction&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Fauks, Keith. Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction. Edinburgh University Press, 1999, pages 71–75]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the reason for the collapse of the social liberal coalition was a challenge in the 1970s from financial interests that could operate independently of national governments. Another cause was the decline of organized labor which had formed part of the coalition, but was also a support for left-wing ideologies challenging the liberal consensus. Related to this was the decline of working class consciousness and the growth of the middle class. The push by the United States, which had been least accepting of social liberalism, for trade liberalization further eroded support.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social liberal parties and organisations worldwide ==
In [[Europe]], social liberal parties tend to be small or medium-sized [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[centre-left]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kirchner |first=Emil |title=Liberal parties in Western Europe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521323949 |year=2000 |pages=356–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of successful European social liberal parties, which have participated in government coalitions at national or regional levels, are the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Democrats 66]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]]. In continental European politics, social liberal parties are integrated in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) group in the [[European Parliament]], which is the fourth biggest group at the parliament and includes both social liberal parties and market liberal parties.&lt;ref name="alde"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alde.eu/en/about-us/national-delegations/ |title=ALDE National Delegations |year=2010 |publisher=ALDE Group in the European Parliament |accessdate=17 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203161032/http://www.alde.eu/en/about-us/national-delegations |archivedate=3 February 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving an exhaustive list of social liberal parties worldwide is difficult, largely because political organisations are not always ideologically pure. Party ideologies often change over time. However, the following parties and organisations are usually accepted by peers&lt;ref group="nb" name="ex04"&gt;[[Liberal International]], [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|ALDE Party]], [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]], [[Africa Liberal Network]], [[Liberal Network for Latin America]] or [[European Liberal Forum]]&lt;/ref&gt; or scholars as following social liberalism as a core ideology.

In [[anthropology]], '''privilege''' is a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/privilege | title=Privilege &amp;#124; Definition of privilege in English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], privilege is the [[perceived]] rights or advantages that are assumed to be available only to a particular person or group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Lucal, B., 1996. Oppression and privilege: Toward a relational conceptualization of race. Teaching Sociology, pp.245-255.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1318739?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in the context of [[social inequality]], particularly in regard to [[ageism|age]], [[disability]], [[Race (human classification)|ethnic or racial category]], [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], and [[social class]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Geographies of Privilege |last = Twine |first = France Winddance |publisher = Routledge |year = 2013 |isbn = 978-0415519618 |location = |pages = 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common examples involve having access to a higher education and housing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under a newer usage of the term, privilege can also be emotional or psychological, regarding comfort and personal self-confidence, or having a sense of belonging or worth in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Privilege: A Reader |last = Kimmel |first = Michael S. |publisher = Westview Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0813344263 |location = |pages = 1, 5, 13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as an academic concept, but has since been invoked more widely, outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/05/check-your-privilege-means |title= Check your privilege!

== History ==
[[File:Du Bois, W. E. B..jpg|thumb|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], author of the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]].'']]
The concept of privilege dates back to 1903 when American [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] published the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', in which he wrote that although [[African American]]s were observant about [[white Americans]] and conscious of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination]], white Americans did not think much about African Americans, nor about the effects of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0253218483|location = |pages = 121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = W.E.B.

In 1988, American [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-racism activist [[Peggy McIntosh]] published the essay ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences through Work in Women’s Studies'', in which she documented forty-six privileges which she, as a white person, experienced in the United States. For example: "I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me", and "I do not have to educate my children to be aware of [[systemic racism]] for their own daily physical protection". McIntosh described [[white privilege]] as an "invisible package of unearned assets" which white people do not want to acknowledge, and which leads to them being confident, comfortable, and oblivious about racial issues, while non-white people become unconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McIntosh's essay has been credited for stimulating academic interest in privilege, which has been extensively studied in the decades since.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last = O'Brien|first = Jodi A.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1412909167|location = |pages = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Princeton University]] first-year student Tal Fortgang wrote ''Checking My Privilege'', a widely debated article in which he condemned classmates who told him to "check his privilege" for attributing his success in life to "some invisible patron saint of white maleness", and "for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theprincetontory.com/main/checking-my-privilege-character-as-the-basis-of-privilege/|title=Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege|last=Fortgang|first=Tal|date=2 April 2014|work=The Princeton Tory|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh afterwards told the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systemically. She argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|title=The Origins of Privilege|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|date=13 May 2014|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as [[racism|race]], [[ageism|age]], [[genderism|gender]], [[heteronormativity|sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[citizenship]], [[religion]], [[physical ability]], health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Plural and Changing Identities: Beyond Identification|last = Casella|first = Eleanor C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|isbn = 9780306486944|location = |pages = 217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNhM_dsYIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Experiences|last = Garnets|first = Linda|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0231124133|location = |pages = 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a white [[lesbian]] [[Professor|university professor]] benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in the Therapy Hour: Voices of Female Clinicians Working with Men (The Routledge Series on Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men)|last = Sweet|first = Holly Barlow|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415885515|location = |pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.

In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|last = Sorrells|first = Kathryn|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1412927444|location = |pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness of privilege ==
Some academics{{such as|date=October 2018}} highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Racial-Cultural Psychology and Counseling, Training and Practice|last = Carter|first = Robert T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0471386292|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes the state of having privilege as being "like running with the wind at your back", unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege.  One writer{{who|date=October 2018}} has referred to such denial as a form of "[[microaggression]]" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last = Sue|first = Derald Wing|publisher = Wiley|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0470491409|location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege, and instead look for ways to justify or minimize the effects of privilege stating that their privilege was fully earned. They justify this by acknowledging the acts of individuals of unearned dominance, but deny that privilege is institutionalized as well as embedded throughout our society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to researchers{{who|date=October 2018}}, privileged individuals resist acknowledging their privileges because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts. Instead it was partly due to a system that has developed to support them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a [[meritocracy]], which researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a [[Meritocracy#Criticism|myth]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Privilege: Teaching and Learning as Allies in the Classroom|last = Case|first = Kim|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415641463|location = |pages =63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School (Princeton Studies in Cultural Sociology)|last = Khan|first = Shamus Rahman|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0691156231|location = |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda Kaye|publisher = SAGE Publications|location = |pages = 471 |isbn=9781452265568 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AP1yAwAAQBAJ |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gendered Society'', Michael Kimmel wrote that when privileged people do not feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race|last = Halley|first = Jean|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1442203075|location = |pages = 67, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

=== Examples of Privilege ===

====Workplace sexism====
{{synthesis|reason="Is that statistically significant?"|date=October 2018}}
Hays, a recruitment firm, sent the same job application to thousands of employers, only changing the name. One was "Simon", the other "Susan". Experienced hiring managers offered "Simon" an interview 15% more often than "Susan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-same-resume-with-different-names-nets-different-results/news-story/a2a182fb4570e948c27ce63139ee66b1 | title=The same resume with different names nets different results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational Racism====
According to McKinley et al.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Students of color are pushed toward academic failure and continued social disenfranchisement. Racist policies and beliefs, in part, explain why children and young adults from racially marginalized groups fail to achieve academically at the same rate as their White peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, Angelina E. Castagno and Emma Maughan
Review of Research in Education 
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning (2007), pp. 159-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of privilege has been criticized for ignoring relative differences among groups. For example, Lawrence Blum argued that in American culture there are status differences among [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[Cambodian American|Cambodians]], and among [[African American]]s, black immigrants from the [[Caribbean American|Caribbean]], and black immigrants from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/publications/publications/A57.pdf|title='White privilege': A mild critique|first=Lawrence|last=Blum|date=2008|journal=Theory and Research in Education|volume=6|doi=10.1177/1477878508095586|issue=6(3) |pages=309–321|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum agreed that privilege exists and is systemic yet nonetheless criticized the label itself, saying that the word "privilege" implies luxuries rather than rights, and arguing that some benefits of privilege such as unimpeded access to [[education]] and [[housing]] would be better understood as rights.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; "[[White privilege]]", Michael Monahan argued, would be more accurately described as the advantages gained by whites through historical disenfranchisement of non-whites rather than something that gives whites privilege above and beyond normal human status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monahan, Michael J.|year=2014|title=The concept of privilege: a critical appraisal|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1080/02580136.2014.892681|issn=0258-0136|eissn=2073-4867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5390">{{short description|Branch of linguistics combining sociolinguistics and phonetics}}
'''Sociophonetics''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] that broadly combines the methods of [[sociolinguistics]] and [[phonetics]]. It addresses the questions of how socially constructed variation in the sound system is used and learned. The term was first used by Denise Deshaies-Lafontaine in their 1974 dissertation on [[Quebecois French]], with early work in the field focusing on answering questions, chiefly sociolinguistic, using phonetic methods and data. The field began to expand rapidly in the 1990s: interest in the field increased and the boundaries of the field expanded to include a wider diversity of topics. Currently, sociophonetic studies often employ methods and insight from a wide range of fields including [[psycholinguistics]], [[clinical linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Foulkes|Scobbie|Watt|2010|pp=703–4}}

== Development ==
&lt;!-- should maybe be renamed to "History" at some point --&gt;
At the intersection between phonetics and sociolinguistics, sociophonetics shares its history with both fields starting with [[Pāṇini]]'s phonetic analysis of [[Sanskrit]] circa 600 BCE.{{sfn|Foulkes|Scobbie|Watt|2010|p=705}} Pānini's grammar investigated differences between standard (Vedic) usage and the regional varieties of Sanskrit spoken outside of ritual contexts, with some grammatical rules taking into account sociolinguistic context.{{sfn|Kiparsky|1993|p=2918}} After Pānini few phonetic studies were conducted until the 1800s when technological advances especially in audio recording became available.{{sfn|Caffrey|2017}} As modern linguistics developed, the types of information investigated tended to be split into an abstract linguistic system and the context in which it is used.{{sfn|Foulkes|Scobbie|Watt|2010|p=705}}{{efn|See, for example, Sausurre's [[langue and parole]] and Chomsky's [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[linguistic performance|performance]].}} The context of use introduces a wide range of variability due to individual variation such as physiological and anatomical differences, but has also been shown to include social and indexical information about the speaker and context.{{sfn|Foulkes|Scobbie|Watt|2010|p=705}}

The field of sociophonetics, and sociolinguistics generally, began in the 1960s and 70s with the work of [[William Labov]] who found statistical correlations between the use of certain pronunciations and membership in social categories. These early investigations tended to focus on variation and change in vowels, and they were conducted almost exclusively in the United States on [[American English]].{{sfn|Baronowski|2013|pp=403–4}}

== Topics investigated ==
Sociophonetics covers a broad range of topics between the quintessential fields phonetics and sociolinguistics. Studies have focused on differences in [[Articulation (phonetics)|speech production]], the social meaning of particular pronunciations, perception and perceivability of sociophonetic patterns, and the role of sociocultural factors in [[Phonetics#Articulatory_models|phonetic models of production]] among other topics.{{sfn|Hay|Drager|2007|p=95}} Of particular interest to sociophoneticians is the sources and causes of variation in speech, with many studies focusing on differences in pronunciation between regions, social classes, races and ethnicities, genders, sexes, sexual orientations, ages, and within speakers.{{sfn|Foulkes|Scobbie|Watt|2010|pp=706–17}} A common thread between these investigations is the role of biology as an influential but not deterministic force in phonetic variation. For example, young boys will often lower their voices before any pubescent, physical changes occur in their vocal tract in order to distinguish themselves from girls and establish themselves as "masculine".{{sfn|Holmes|Wilson|2017|p=Chapter 7}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3634">'''Sound sculpture''' (related to [[sound art]] and [[sound installation]]) is an [[intermedia]] and time based art form in which [[sculpture]] or any kind of art object produces [[sound]], or the reverse (in the sense that sound is manipulated in such a way as to create a sculptural as opposed to temporal form or mass). Most often sound sculpture artists were primarily either [[Visual arts|visual artists]] or [[composer]]s, not having started out directly making sound sculpture.

[[Cymatics]] and [[kinetic art|kinetic]] art have influenced sound sculpture. Sound sculpture is sometimes [[site-specific art|site-specific]].

Grayson described sound sculpture in 1975 as "the integration of visual form and beauty with magical, musical sounds through participatory experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grayson |first=John |date=1975 |title=Sound sculpture : a collection of essays by artists surveying the techniques, applications, and future directions of sound sculpture |publisher=A.R.C.

'''''The Albino Code''''' (2006) is a short film parodying the [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.  ''The Albino Code'' was written and produced by, and stars, [[Dennis Hurley (actor)|Dennis Hurley]], who has [[albinism]].  The film pokes fun at the depiction of people with albinism in Hollywood films by parodying ''The Da Vinci Code'' character [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Silas|Silas]].  Hurley's film points out flaws with the portrayal of Silas, namely that most people with albinism do not have pink eyes, and that due to their impaired vision, they could not function well as assassins.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;[http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=138640 ''Boston Herald''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813085634/http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=138640 |date=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The group, comprising critical gender, feminist, and queer scholars, formed to tackle "neurosexism"&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt; as defined by [[Cordelia Fine]] in her 2010 book ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'' "uncritical biases in [neuroscientific] research and public perception, and their societal impacts on an individual, structural, and symbolic level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fine | first = Cordelia | author-link = Cordelia Fine | title = Delusions of gender: how our minds, society, and neurosexism create difference | publisher = W.W.

By contrast they practice "neurofeminism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bluhm | first1 = Robyn | last2 = Maibom | first2 = Heidi Lene | last3 = Jaap Jacobson | first3 = Anne | author-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780230296732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to critically evaluate [[heteronormative]] assumptions of contemporary brain research and examine the impact and cultural significance of neuroscientific research on society's views about gender.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kaiser | first1 = Anelis | last2 = Dussauge | first2 = Isabelle | author-link1 = Anelis Kaiser | author-link2 = Isabelle Dussauge | contribution = Re-queering the brain | editor-last1 = Bluhm | editor-first1 = Robyn | editor-last2 = Jacobson | editor-first2 = Anne Jaap | editor-last3 = Maibom | editor-first3 = Heidi Lene | editor-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science | pages = 121&amp;ndash;144 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Hampshire New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781349333929 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network advocate greater emphasis to be placed on [[neuroplasticity]] rather than biological determinism.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidal | first1 = Catherine | title = The sexed brain: between science and ideology | journal = Neuroethics, Special Issue: Neuroscience and Sex/Gender | volume = 5 | issue =  3 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-011-9121-9 | date = December 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==
=== Sex differences in human neonatal social perception ===
Non-network member, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], conducted a test on newborns – on average a day-and-a-half old – to see if they were more interested a human face (social object) or a mobile (physical-mechanical object). Baron-Cohen concluded that the results, based on the eye-gaze of the babies, "showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face" and the "research clearly demonstrates that sex differences are in part biological in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connellan | first1 = Jennifer | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Wheelwright | first3 = Sally | last4 = Batkia | first4 = Anna | last5 = Ahluwaliab | first5 = Jag | author-link2 = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Sex differences in human neonatal social perception | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;119 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-6383(00)00032-1 | date = January 2000 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.627.1904 }}

Network member, [[Cordelia Fine]], criticized the experiment as being flawed for a number of reasons including: the expectations of the experimenter (graduate student, Jennifer Connellan), for example, unconsciously moving her head more / smiling more for a female baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nash | first1 = Alison | last2 = Grossi | first2 = Giordana | author-link2 = Giordana Grossi | title = Picking Barbie™'s brain: inherent sex differences in scientific ability? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary Feminist Thought, Special Issue: Women and Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 29&amp;ndash;42 | date = 2007 | url =  http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/jift/vol2/iss1/5  | ref = harv }} [https://faculty.newpaltz.edu/giordanagrossi/files/NashGrossi2007.pdf Pdf.]

Norton &amp; Company | page = 84 | location = New York | isbn = 9780393068382| title-link = Delusions of Gender }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Fine's book Baron-Cohen "we included a panel of independent judges coding the videotapes of just the eye-region of the baby’s face, from which it is virtually impossible to judge the sex of the baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Delusions of gender – 'neurosexism', biology and politics (book review) | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 904&amp;ndash;905 | date = November 2010 | url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-11/book-reviews | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Fine argued, "clearly, if the behaviour of the experimenter-cum-stimulus has already inadvertently influenced the babies’ eye gaze behaviour, the introduction of sex-blind judges is to close the stable door after the horse has bolted," and fellow network member [[Gina Rippon]] added, "the potential for misuse of our [neuroscientists] research should make us doubly careful of how (and why) we do research into these kinds of arenas, and how we report our findings. [...] Whether we like it or not, science and politics do mix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rippon | first1 = Gina | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | author-link1 = Gina Rippon | author-link2 = Cordelia Fine | title = Forum: Seductive arguments? | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 948&amp;ndash;949 | date = December 2010 | url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences when processing fear ===
In an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study into the gender differences when processing fear, Schienle ''et al.'' (who are not part of The NeuroGenderings Network) began with an hypothesis that women would show a greater emotional response than men. In fact, the results showed the opposite. The researchers' explanation for the unexpected response pattern was that it "may reflect greater attention from males to cues of aggression in their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schienle | first1 = Anne | last2 = Schäfer | first2 = Axel | last3 = Stark | first3 = Rudolf | last4 = Walter | first4 = Bertram | last5 = Vaitl | first5 = Dieter | title = Gender differences in the processing of disgust- and fear-inducing pictures: an fMRI study | journal = [[NeuroReport]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277&amp;ndash;280 | pmid = 15706235 | date = 28 February 2005 | url = http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2005/02280/Gender_differences_in_the_processing_of_disgust_.15.aspx | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network member [[Robyn Bluhm]] criticized the initial hypothesis, that women would show a greater emotional response than men, as stereotyping. She also criticized the researchers' explanation for the unexpected results, as they discounted the possibility that men may be more sensitive to fear than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Turk | first = Victoria | title = You can't just reduce neurological differences to "women can't read maps" | work = [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] | url = https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvywam/how-neurosexism-feeds-stereotypes-about-mens-and-womens-brains | date = 28 November 2014 | access-date = 25 August 2017}}

=== Female brain / male brain versus "mosaics" of brain features ===
An article by Tracey Shors found "sex differences in emotional and cognitive responses in rats" and she advised that her findings "be used to better understand and promote mental health in humans" as "a greater appreciation of our [sex] differences can only enhance our ability to treat our common afflictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shors | first = Tracey J. | title = Opposite effects of stressful experience on memory formation in males versus females | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience, Special Issuel: CNS Aspects of Reproductive Endocrinology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 139&amp;ndash;147 | pmc = 3181678 | date = June 2002 | url = https://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/04/DialoguesClinNeurosci-4-139.pdf | ref = harv | pmid = 22033590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the research carried out by network member [[Daphna Joel]] ''et al.'' found that "between 55% and 70% of people had a “mosaic” of gender characteristics, compared to less than one per cent who had only “masculine” or only “feminine” characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Joel | first1 = Daphna | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | author-link1 = Daphna Joel | author-link2 = Cordelia Fine | title = It's time to celebrate the fact that there are many ways to be male and female | work = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/brain-sex-many-ways-to-be-male-and-female | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 December 2015 | access-date = 26 August 2017}}

[[File:The-sword-project-logo.gif|right]]'''The SWORD Project''' is the CrossWire Bible Society's free software project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform [[open-source software|open-source]] tools—covered by the [[GNU General Public License]]—that allow [[programmer]]s and [[Bible society|Bible societies]] to write new [[Bible software]] more quickly and easily.

==Overview==
The core of The SWORD Project is a [[cross-platform]] [[Library (computing)|library]] written in [[C++]], providing access, search functions and other utilities to a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages.&lt;ref name="p-s"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115254414.html|title=Religion Meets Computer Revolution|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=2004-04-11|author=Al Fasoldt|work=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any software based on their [[Application programming interface|API]] can use this collection.

JSword is a separate implementation, written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], which reproduces most of the API features of the C++ API and supports most SWORD data content.

The project is one of the primary implementers of and contributors to the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] (OSIS), a standardized [[XML]] language for the encoding of scripture. The software is also capable of utilizing certain resources encoded in using the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) format and maintains deprecated support for [[Theological Markup Language]] (ThML) and [[General Bible Format]] (GBF).

==Bible study front-end applications==

The '''Vasyugan Swamp''' ({{Lang-ru|Васюганские болота}}) is the largest [[swamps|swamp]] in the northern hemisphere. It is located in Russia, in [[West Siberian Plain|southwestern Siberia]].

The swamp is a major reservoir of [[fresh water]] for the region, and the [[Vasyugan River|Vasyugan river]] has its source there. It is home to a number of [[endangered species]] which is a concern among local [[environmentalist]]s as the production of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] has become a major industry in the region.

The swamp is located in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk]], and [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk]] regions of [[Russia]] along the west bank of the [[Ob River]], and stretches between latitudes 55°35' and 58°40' North, and longitudes 74°30' and 83°30' East.

==History==
It appeared nearly 10,000 years ago and from that time has constantly increased in size. 75% of the contemporary area became waterlogged less than 500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/campaigns/world-natural-heritage/great-vasyugan-mire/ |title=Great Vasyugan Mire &amp;#124; Greenpeace Russia |website=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305022156/http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/campaigns/world-natural-heritage/great-vasyugan-mire/ |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=December 2011}}
{{Merge to|Affluence in the United States|discuss=Talk:Wealth_in_the_United_States#merged|date=November 2017}}

'''Wealth in the United States''' is commonly measured in terms of [[net worth]], which is the sum of all [[asset]]s, including the market value of real estate, like a home, minus all [[Liability (accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref name="US Federal Reserve on wealth distribution in the United States"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/papers/concentration.2001.10.pdf|title=US Federal Reserve on wealth distribution in the United States|accessdate=2006-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the wealthiest country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/america-wealth-inequality/|title=America Is the Richest, and Most Unequal, Country|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1-US Household Wealth - Real and Nominal.png|thumb|450px|U.S. Household and Non-Profit Net Worth 1959 - 2016, nominal and real (2016 dollars). It reached a record $93 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in Q4 2016.]]
For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 − $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets.

As one would expect, households with greater income feature the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth.

==Income vs. wealth==
{{Main|Household income in the United States}}
While income is often seen as a type of wealth in colloquial language use, wealth and income are two substantially different measures of economic prosperity. Wealth is the total number of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of wealth over a given time period. Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period. Income is a so-called "[[Stock and flow|flow]]" variable, while wealth is a so-called "[[Stock and flow|stock]]" variable.

==Changes in wealth, 1989–2001==
[[File:Change in US household wealth 1946-2007.gif|thumb|Year-on-year change in total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1946–2007, unadjusted for inflation or population change.]]
When observing the changes in the wealth among American households, one can note an increase in wealthier individuals and a decrease in the number of poor households, while net worth increased most substantially in semi-wealthy and wealthy households. Overall the percentage of households with a negative net worth (more debt than assets) declined from 9.5% in 1989 to 4.1% in 2001.&lt;ref name="US Federal Reserve on wealth distribution in the United States" /&gt;

The percentage of net worths ranging from $500,000 to one million doubled while the percentage of millionaires tripled.&lt;ref name="US Federal Reserve on wealth distribution in the United States" /&gt; From 1995 to 2004, there was tremendous growth among household wealth, as it nearly doubled from $21.9 trillion to $43.6 trillion, but the wealthiest quartile of the economic distribution made up 89% of this growth.&lt;ref name="GWUS" /&gt; During this time frame, wealth became increasingly unequal, and the wealthiest 25% became even wealthier.

According to US Census Bureau statistics this "Upward shift" is most likely the result of a booming housing market which caused homeowners to experience tremendous increases in home equity. Life-cycles have also attributed to the rising wealth among Americans. With more and more baby-boomers reaching the climax of their careers and the middle aged population making up a larger segment of the population now than ever before, more and more households have achieved comfortable levels of wealth.&lt;ref name="US Federal Reserve on wealth distribution in the United States" /&gt; Zhu Xiao Di (2004) notes that household wealth usually peaks around families headed by people in their 50s, and as a result, the baby boomer generation reached this age range at the time of the analysis.&lt;ref name="GWUS" /&gt;

===Changes in wealth after 2007===
Household net worth fell from 2007 to 2009 by a total of $17.5 trillion or 25.5%. This was the equivalent loss of one year of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David  |last=Broder |title=Syndicated column:A sobering message.

By the fourth quarter of 2010, the household net worth had recovered by a growth of 1.3 percent to a total of $56.8 trillion. An additional growth of 15.7 percent is needed just to bring the value to where it was before the [[Late-2000s recession|recession]] started in December 2007.&lt;ref name="U.S. Federal Reserve"/&gt; In 2014 a record breaking net worth of $80.7 trillion was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/03/06/us-household-net-worth-sets-record/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516081645/http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/03/06/us-household-net-worth-sets-record/ |archive-date=2015-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms to gain wealth==
[[Assets]] are known as the raw materials of wealth, and they consist primarily of stocks and other financial and non-financial property, particularly homeownership.&lt;ref name="WEM"&gt;Haskins, Ron: "Wealth and Economic Mobility". Economic Mobility Project, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While these assets are unequally distributed, financial assets are much more unequal. In 2004, the top 1% controlled 50.3% of the financial assets while the bottom 90% only held 14.4% of the total US financial assets.&lt;ref name="WEM"/&gt;

These discrepancies exist despite the availability of many wealth building tools established by the Federal Government. These include 401k plans, 403b plans, and IRAs. Traditional IRAs, 401k and 403b plans are tax shelters created for working individuals. These plans allow for tax sheltered (or pre-tax) contributions of earned income directly to tax sheltered savings accounts. Annual contributions are capped to ensure that high earners cannot enjoy the tax benefit disproportionally. The Roth IRA is another tool that can help create wealth in the working and middle classes.

Assets in Roth IRAs grow tax free; interests, dividends, and capital gains are all exempt from income taxes. Contributions to Roth IRAs are limited to those with annual incomes less than the threshold established yearly by the IRS. The benefits of these plans, however, are only available to workers and families whose incomes and expenses allow them excess funds to commit for a long period, typically until the investor reaches age 59½. The effect of these tools are further limited by the contribution limits placed on them.

Including [[human capital]] such as skills, the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21557732 |title=Free exchange: The real wealth of nations |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr |title=Inclusive Wealth Report - IHDP |publisher=Ihdp.unu.edu |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630055324/http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr/ |archive-date=2012-06-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an analysis that excludes pensions and social security, the richest 1% of the American population in 2007 owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.&lt;ref name="Domhoff"&gt;[http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html Wealth, Income, and Power] by G. William Domhoff of the UC-Santa Cruz Sociology Department&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to the federal reserve, "For most households, pensions and Social Security are the most important sources of income during retirement, and the promised benefit stream constitutes a sizable fraction of household wealth" and "including pensions and Social Security in net worth makes the distribution more even".&lt;ref name="fedres"&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/pensionk_s.pdf Pensions, Social Security, and the Distribution of Wealth] by Arthur B. Kennickell and Annika E. Sundén of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System&lt;/ref&gt;  When including household wealth from pensions and social security, the richest 1% of the American population in 1992 owned 16% of the country's total wealth, as opposed to 32% when excluding pensions and social security.

After the [[Great Recession]] which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%.  The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%.&lt;ref name=Wolff2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Domhoff"/&gt;

According to the [[Congressional Budget Office]], between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%.

If a family has a positive net worth then it has more wealth than the combined net worth of over 30.6 million American families. This is because the bottom 25% of American families have a negative combined net worth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm, Summary Results; Public Date, Estimates inflation-adjusted to 2013 dollars, Table 4; Population number in: Changes in U.S. Family Finances(pdf); Also see table below in Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications in interpreting income statistics===

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Interpreting these income statistics is complicated by several factors: membership in the top 1% changes from year to year, the IRS made large changes in the definition of adjusted gross income in 1987, and numbers for particular income ranges may be distorted by outliers (in the top segment) and failure to include transfer payments (in the lower segments).

Income Mobility: The IRS occasionally studies income data from actual households over time, usually over one decade. They actually underestimate income mobility by excluding the most mobile population from their studies: those under age 25.

Most people{{who|date=January 2018}} only look at annual reported income data split into income quintiles. It is erroneous to assume that individual households remain in the same quintile over time, just as it usually is when using aggregate data. A majority of households in the top income quintile in one year, for example, will have moved to a lower quintile within a decade. Three out of four households in the top 0.01% of income will no longer be in that small group ten years later. In summary, half of all of U.S. households move from one income quintile to a different income quintile every decade. And actual households who started a decade in the lowest quintile of income, when tracked over the next ten years, will have proportionally more income growth than actual households who started the decade in the highest quintile of income. Thus, when comparing income/wealth quintile distributions from different time periods, generalizations can only be made with regards to the households in aggregate for each quintile, and can not be made to any individual households over the same time period (i.e. assuming the wealth value has been appropriately adjusted for differences in time, one cannot infer that a decrease in total wealth percentage for one quintile over time means that the households from that quintile have lost wealth as individuals, but only that total wealth percentage has decreased for those in that quintile at the time of measurement).

Top 20% income vs. Bottom 20% income households: (1) The average number of people with jobs in a top income quintile household is two, while a majority of bottom income quintile households have no one employed. (2) If there are two adult income earners in a household who are married, their incomes are combined on tax forms. This is very common among top quintile income households. The lowest quintile households, however, include a lot more single-person households, or two unmarried working adults living together, and sharing expenses, but reporting their incomes to the IRS as if they were two separate households. (3) 75% to 80% of the actual income for bottom quintile households is transfer payments (aka "welfare") that are not included in IRS income data. The top income quintile gets a very small percentage of their actual income from transfer payments.

(4) The IRS warns against comparisons of pre-1987 and post-1987 income data due to significant changes in the definition of adjusted gross income (AGI) that made top quintile households appear to have large reported income gains, when in fact there was no change to their income at all. In addition to the AGI changes, large marginal tax rate reductions during the Reagan Administration caused another large change in tax reporting. A lot of corporate income formerly reported on corporate tax returns was switched to lower tax rate individual tax returns (as Subchapter S corporations). This reporting change appeared to boost top quintile income, when in fact their incomes had not changed. As a result, the top income quintile for households today includes a lot of corporate income previously reported in corporate tax returns, while Subchapter S corporations who lose money are likely to be included in the bottom income quintile households. Income comparisons that compare pre-1987 to post-1987 income are very common, but they are also biased, according to the IRS, and should be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Addition reading on income mobility: http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/11/ES1115.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact of age and experience:  people that are older and have more experience tend to have considerably larger incomes that younger and inexperienced workers.  But all older and experience people were young and inexperienced at one point.  So comparing incomes between groups without normalizing for age and experience is somewhat meaningless.

===Home ownership and race===
{{further|Racial inequality in the United States#Home ownership}}
Home ownership is one of the main sources of wealth among families in the United States.

The total value of all U.S. household wealth in 2000 was approximately $44 trillion. Prior to the [[Late-2000s recession]] which began in December 2007 its value was at $65.9 trillion. After, it plunged to $48.5 trillion during the first quarter of 2009. The total household net worth rose 1.3% by the fourth quarter of 2009 to $54.2 trillion, indicating the American economy is recovering.
