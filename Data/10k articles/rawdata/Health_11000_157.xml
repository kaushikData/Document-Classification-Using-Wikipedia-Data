On November 14, 2008, three people were fatally shot at the office of SiPort, a start-up company in [[Santa Clara, California]] in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/09/15/despite-murders-siport-manages-to-get-its-radio-chip-done-for-microsofts-zune-hd-media-player/|title=Despite murders, SiPort completes its radio chip for Microsoft's Zune HD media player|work=VentureBeat|date=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jing Hua Wu was arrested and convicted.

==Shooting== 
SiPort CEO Sid Agrawal, human resources manager Marilyn Lewis, and vice president of operations Brian Pugh were all shot fatally in the head. It was one of the deadliest workplace killings in Silicon Valley history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_22749496/san-jose-engineer-found-guilty-killing-three-bosses|title=Santa Clara: Fired SiPort engineer found guilty of first degree murder in slaying of three bosses|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2010/02/24/with-new-ceo-siport-tries-to-put-triple-homicide-behind-it/|title=With New CEO, SiPort Tries To Put Triple Homicide Behind It|work=Wall Street Journal|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/08/jing-hua-wu-convicted-sil_n_2840318.html|title=Jing Hua Wu Convicted; Silicon Valley Engineer Killed 3 Bosses Who Laid Him Off|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator==
Wu (born 1961-62) was born in China, and was a former employee of SiPort. He was distraught over losing his job at the company.

==Legal proceedings== 
Jing Hua Wu was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and special circumstances of using a firearm, and was represented by high-profile defense attorney [[Tony Serra]]. On March 8, 2013, Wu was found guilty of all charges. On August 2, 2013, Wu was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and an additional 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/08/02/former-santa-clara-tech-engineer-gets-life-without-parole-75-years-for-killing-3-co-workers/ Former Santa Clara Tech Engineer Gets Life Without Parole + 75 Years For Killing 3 Co-Workers], [[CBS News]], August 2, 2013, Retrieved on December 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who perform an unauthorized abortion on a woman may face up to five years' imprisonment if she consents, and up to ten years if it is performed without her consent.&lt;ref name="un45"/&gt;

Historically, abortion was allowed in Qatari society only if the pregnancy was deemed to endanger the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|publisher=Longman Group|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar's penal code ratified this convention in 1971 by legalizing abortion in cases where the mother's life would be saved. Furthermore, a law formalized in 1983 states that abortions may be legally performed on pregnancies of less than four months duration if the pregnancy were to cause serious harm to the mother's health if continued, or if there was evidence that the child would be born with untreatable mental or physical deficiencies and both parents consented to the abortion.&lt;ref name="un45"/&gt; 

Abortions must first be recommended by a medical commission comprising three specialists before it can be performed. By law, abortions must be performed in a government hospital.&lt;ref name="un45"/&gt;

Most abortions carried out by residents of Qatar are performed in the country itself rather than abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-qatar.html|title=Historical abortion statistics, Qatar|author=Robert Johnston|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions in Qatar are sometimes performed by women who are pregnant out of wedlock as a direct result of the illegality of giving birth to a child out of wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/facing-jail-unmarried-pregnant-women-in-qatar-left/|title=Facing jail, unmarried pregnant women in Qatar left with hard choices|publisher=Doha News|date=27 August 2013|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Audiometrist''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|audīre}}, "to hear"; and from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[wikt:-metria|-metria]]'', “to measure” ) or '''Audiometric Officer''', is a health-care professional technician&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haasa.org.au/audiometrist.html&lt;/ref&gt; who has received special training in the use of [[Pure tone audiometry]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/audiometrist|title=audiometrist|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audiometrist conducts [[hearing tests]], or "audiometric screening", with an [[Audiometer]] to establish [[Threshold of hearing|hearing levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audiometry.sydneyinstitute.wikispaces.net/assessmentofhearing#Assessment+of+hearing-Hearing+thresholds-What+is+a+hearing+threshold?|title=audiometry - assessmentofhearing|website=audiometry.sydneyinstitute.wikispaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are represented by an [[audiogram]], and are usually interpreted by an [[audiologist]], or a registered [[Medical Officer]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Occupational_Health/audiometry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; unless the audiometrist is also an audiologist, with the aim of diagnosing [[hearing loss]].

There are currently some misconceptions regarding the definition of Audiometrist and Audiologist, which vary from country to country. These misconceptions continue to grow, in [[Australia]] in particular, which leads to the need for greater communication, less segregation of each other's role within the community and a broader understanding of each other's qualifications.

==Audiometrist vs. Audiologist==

The word "Audiometrist" is derived from the word [[Audiometry]], as distinct from [[Audiology]]. However, the title audiometrist is often used interchangeably with the role of audiologists, thereby making a precise definition of the word more difficult. Audiologists can therefore refer to themselves as audiometrists, although they still perform the tasks of audiologists. The origin of this cross-attribution is unclear, but may stem from the fact that many audiometrists also receive subsequent training in audiology, thereby making them both audiometrists and audiologists. Additionally, preferences for definitions of audiometrists are more varied worldwide, mainly because Audiometry education and licensing requirements vary from country to country, and the use or mis-use of the word in this fashion continues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See talk page on this article for a dispute on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; A further role confusion arises because many audiometrists are involved directly in the hearing aid industry in an assistive capacity when they get in-house training for hearing aid audiometry,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-hear-faq-faq13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while others apply audiometry purely to [[Occupational Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearing.ie/occ_audiometric_testing.html|title=Hearing Healthcare Ireland - audiometric screening tests ireland, hearing tests dublin, hearing check, hearing screen, occupational hearing, hearing protection, industrial audiometry,|first=Hearing Healthcare|last=Ireland|website=www.hearing.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiology.org/resources/documentlibrary/documents/niohlprevention.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913223729/http://www.audiology.org/resources/documentlibrary/Documents/niohlprevention.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since audiologists are more qualified, they can do the work of audiometrists, but not the other way round. This may often lead to the assumption that audiometrists are audiologists.

===Uk and Ireland===

In the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] Audiometrists generally differ from Audiologists in that they do not require or hold an [[Academic Degree]] or [[Doctorate]] in Audiology. Audiometrists are [[certified]] under the British and Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists, the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (UK and Ireland) and the Health and Safety Authority (Ireland), and the time period of their training is generally shorter than audiologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amplivox.ltd.uk/category/courses/audiometry-course/|title=Audiometry course - Amplivox UK|website=www.amplivox.ltd.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npag.org.uk/event/audiometry/|title=Royal Asiatic Society|website=www.npag.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Audiologists, they are not licensed to treat hearing loss with the use of [[hearing aids]].

===Australia and New Zealand===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
As in the UK and Ireland, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] Audiometrists can receive certified training in [[audiometric screening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearingcompany.com.au/audiometric-officer-5-day/|title=Audiometric Officer Course - Audiometry Courses, Occupational Audiometry, WorkCover Approved, The Hearing Company|website=www.hearingcompany.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/HLT41312|title=training.gov.au - HLT41312 - Certificate IV in Audiometric Assessment|website=training.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the UK and Ireland, Audiometrists in Australia can prescribe hearing aids to treat a hearing loss if they complete the appropriate training.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hearing.com.au/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=100&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearing.com.au/faqs/|title=Frequently asked questions - Australian Hearing|website=www.hearing.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs/health/audiologistaudiometrist/how-to-enter-the-job&lt;/ref&gt;

An Audiometrist can choose to complete either a Certificate IV in Audiometric Assessment (available only as part of an apprenticeship) or a Diploma of Hearing Device Prescription and Evaluation. Only Audiometrists who complete the Diploma, and the further training below, are qualified to prescribe and fit hearing aids.

Upon graduation of their Diploma, Audiometrists may choose to complete two years supervised clinical experience where they are closely supervised and monitored in a wide variety of techniques. These range from paediatric assessment of clients aged from 3 years to assessment of elderly clients and cover all aspects of screening, diagnostic and prescriptive methods. After this time they are permitted to sit a stringent theoretical and practical exam before a panel of industry experts to be declared competent to prescribe and fit hearing aids. This is a requirement for an Audiometrist to be a member of a [[professional body]].

An Audiologist, who has completed a degree called "Master of Audiology", is required to complete twelve months of supervised clinical experience and be declared competent to be a member of a professional body.

In Australia, the professional bodies for Audiometrists are:
[http://www.acaud.org Australian College of Audiology (ACAud)] – Audiologists and Audiometrists; and
[http://www.haasa.org.au Hearing Aid Audiometrists Society of Australia (HAASA)] – Audiometrists only.

Audiometrists providing services under the [http://www.hearingservices.gov.au Australian Government Hearing Services Program] must have [http://www.hearingservices.gov.au/wps/portal/hso/site/prof/practitioners/obligations_practitioner/!ut/p/a1/tVLLboMwEPyVXnJEXvPmGKVVSxJUJX0BF7QQA46CTcCtqn59TdpDeqA0h_pgabWzOzOrISmJSSrwjVeouBR4GOrUzdYhmNS0Yek_2xTmi0147UcrAKDkhaQkLYRqVU2SupdXhRSKCTWD9jU_8GIGtWyY_hl2XFRZ28mS9f1pe69BHRaKD2Ss06XUI1_cfXbeGkharNiO9bwSp6rgO5L46CIG1DHywCwM2wrQyC1mGW6OgW8jWszJtYdEe4CRN4c_WTyH3FueCaG3fXJd54bChk4AVvAN-EVDokV6oypuKXm40PXEQu_ihcupO-k78_3xmM51IIYQvCsS_18iNJvZRYuoGpKhaoOLUpL4xzSJR6fbpvH35drd3n08lk2TRcpJPgENnEsZ/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh appropriate membership] of a professional body. This also applies to Audiologists.

While an Audiometrist can provide many of the same services as an Audiologist under the Australian Government Hearing Services Program, there are some diagnostic services that can only be provided by Audiologists. Other than referral to an Audiologist or [[Otolaryngology|ENT]] for these services, an Audiometrist does not require approval or supervision by an Audiologist. This does not apply to an Audiometrist with a Certificate IV qualification, who cannot provide unsupervised services under the Australian Government Hearing Services Program.

===U.S. and Canada===

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], Audiometrists, sometimes referred to as "Audiometric Technicians",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/ochs3330|title=BCIT : : OCHS 3330 - Industrial Audiometric Technician|website=www.bcit.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  also receive accreditation in audiometric screening, under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA)and [[Master of Healthcare Administration]] (MHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticassociates.com/CAOHC_3day.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723110133/http://acousticassociates.com/CAOHC_3day.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When audiometry is applied to industry, audiometrists are sometimes also called Occupational Hearing Conservationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caohc.org/ohc/ohccertified.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123025337/http://www.caohc.org/ohc/ohccertified.php |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvltec.edu/ccd.aspx?id%3D5599#ROC575 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623052723/http://gvltec.edu/ccd.aspx?id=5599 |archivedate=2011-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themedicalcareersinstitute.com/NewAudiometric.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629185506/http://www.themedicalcareersinstitute.com/NewAudiometric.htm |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Audiometrists become qualified as Audiologists, they are more commonly referred to as Hearing Instrument Specialists, and are licensed hearing professionals that perform diagnostic hearing evaluations, as well as prescribe and fit hearing aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgebrown.ca/S117-2013-2014/|title=Hearing Instrument Specialist Program (S117) at George Brown College in Toronto 2013-2014|website=www.georgebrown.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/1176.jsp|title=Hearing Instrument Specialist Program &amp; Courses - Conestoga College|website=www.conestogac.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokanefalls.edu/TechProf/HIS/HISWhatDo.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116053435/http://spokanefalls.edu/TechProf/HIS/HISWhatDo.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/ocabr/licensee/dpl-boards/he/frequently-asked-question.html#1|title=Frequently Asked Question|first=|last=dpl|date=13 February 2007|website=Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hearing Instrument Specialist in the US or Canada is the equivalent of a [[Hearing Aid Dispenser]] in the UK or Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bshaa.com/public/report.aspx?memberqueryid%3DFE17FAF7-B437-4DC1-B762-FD4C904904A6%26atc%3Daaa%26nodeid%3DA79410B4-DB2D-4516-BAB9-195DCBB22FC0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801005100/http://www.bshaa.com/public/report.aspx?memberqueryid=FE17FAF7-B437-4DC1-B762-FD4C904904A6&amp;atc=aaa&amp;nodeid=A79410B4-DB2D-4516-BAB9-195DCBB22FC0 |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Battle with cancer''' is a term used by [[mass media|the media]] when referring to people suffering from [[cancer]]. Those who have died are said to have "lost their battle with cancer", while the living are described as "fighting cancer". It has been argued that words such as "battle" and "fight" are inappropriate, as they suggest that cancer can be defeated if one fights hard enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancyspoint.com/stating-a-person-lost-herhis-battle-with-cancer-is-insulting/ |title=Stating a Person Lost Her/His Battle with Cancer Is Insulting &amp;#124; Nancy's Point |website=Nancyspoint.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyingmatters.org/story/cancer-illness-not-battle |title=Cancer is an illness, not a battle |publisher=Dying Matters |date= |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/god-running-partner/2015/01/stop-using-the-phrase-someone-lost-their-battle-with-cancer/ |title=Stop Using The Phrase "Someone Lost Their Battle With Cancer" |website=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The phrase is often used when someone dies, and may appear in [[obituary|obituaries]]. For example, a statement from [[Victoria Wood]]'s publicist in April 2016 said that Wood had "passed away, after a short but brave battle with cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leon Watson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/20/comedian-victoria-wood-dies-of-cancer-aged-62/ |title=Comedian Victoria Wood dies aged 62 after short cancer battle |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=20 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heather Saul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/victoria-wood-dead-actress-and-comedian-dies-from-cancer-a6992966.html |title=Victoria Wood dead: Comedian and actress dies from cancer aged 62 |publisher=The Independent |date=20 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, journalist [[A.A. Gill]] was described by [[Sky News]] as having died after a "short fight with cancer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/story/restaurant-critic-aa-gill-dies-after-short-fight-with-cancer-10690771 Restaurant critic AA Gill dies aged 62 after short fight with cancer.] Sky News, 11 December 2016. 11 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2014 led by [[Elena Semino]], a professor of linguistics at [[Lancaster University]], alongside palliative care specialists, based on 1.5 million words of discussion, led Semino to say, "We have enough evidence to suggest that battle metaphors are sufficiently negative for enough people that they shouldn’t be imposed on anyone". The study stated that doctors should avoid battle/fight metaphors unless patients themselves chose to use them, and obituaries should avoid them, especially the idea of "losing" such a battle/fight. By comparison, another common metaphor, comparing cancer to a "journey" was "less likely to lead to feelings of guilt or failure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charlie Cooper |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mind-your-language-battling-cancer-metaphors-can-make-terminally-ill-patients-worse-9836322.html |title=Mind your language: 'Battling' cancer metaphors can make terminally ill patients worse &amp;#124; Health News &amp;#124; Lifestyle |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2014 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' titled "Having cancer is not a fight or a battle", the medical doctor [[Kate Granger]], who was diagnosed with [[desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor]] (a type of [[sarcoma]]), explains how the use of military language, whilst perhaps aiming to instil a sense of positivity, can have the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Granger |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/25/having-cancer-not-fight-or-battle |title=Having cancer is not a fight or a battle &amp;#124; Society |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A charity has been named Cyclists Fighting Cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclistsfc.org.uk/ |title=Cyclists Fighting Cancer |website=Cyclistsfc.org.uk |date= |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and foods have been described as "cancer-fighting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20430736,00.html |title=6 Cancer-Fighting Superfoods |website=Health.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other illnesses/conditions==
The concept of a "battle with..." is used in similar phrases such as a "battle with depression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/30/battle-depression-taught-me-medicine-love |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224012855/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/30/battle-depression-taught-me-medicine-love |archivedate=24 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bursitis''' is the [[inflammation]] of one or more [[Synovial bursa|bursae]] (small sacs) of [[synovial fluid]] in the body. They are lined with a [[synovial membrane]] that secretes a lubricating synovial fluid.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vigorita |first1=Vincent J. |last2=Ghelman |first2=Bernard |last3=Mintz |first3=Douglas |date=2008 |title=Orthopaedic Pathology |edition=Second |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7817-9670-5 |pages=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 150 bursae in the human body.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; The bursae rest at the points where internal functionaries, such as [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s, slide across [[bone]]. Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying on the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem. Muscle can also be stiffened.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bursitis commonly affects superficial bursae. These include the [[acromial|subacromial]], [[patellar|prepatellar]], [[calcaneal|retrocalcaneal]], and [[Pes anserinus (leg)|''pes anserinus'']] bursae of the shoulder, knee, heel and shin, etc. (see [[#Examples by site|below]]).&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; Symptoms vary from localized warmth and [[erythema]]&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; to joint pain and stiffness, to stinging pain that surrounds the joint around the inflamed bursa. In this condition, the pain usually is worse during and after activity, and then the bursa and the surrounding joint becomes stiff the next morning.

==Cause==
There can be several concurrent causes. Trauma, [[auto-immune]] disorders, [[infection]] and [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] (medicine-related) factors can all cause bursitis.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; Bursitis is commonly caused by [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive movement]] and excessive pressure. Shoulders, elbows and knees are the most commonly affected. Inflammation of the bursae may also be caused by other inflammatory conditions such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[scleroderma]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[gout]]. [[Immune deficiencies]], including [[HIV]] and [[diabetes]], can also cause bursitis.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; Infrequently, [[scoliosis]] can cause bursitis of the shoulders; however, shoulder bursitis is more commonly caused by overuse of the shoulder joint and related muscles.

[[Traumatic injury]] is another cause of bursitis. The inflammation irritates because the bursa no longer fits in the original small area between the bone and the functionary muscle or tendon. When the bone increases pressure upon the bursa, bursitis results. Sometimes the cause is unknown. It can also be associated with various other [[Chronic disease|chronic systemic diseases]].

==Diagnosis==
===Types===
The most common examples of this condition:
* [[Prepatellar bursitis]], "housemaid's knee"
* [[Infrapatellar bursitis]], "clergyman's knee"
* [[Greater trochanteric pain syndrome|Trochanteric bursitis]], giving pain over [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] aspect of hip
* [[Olecranon bursitis]], "student's elbow", characterised by pain and swelling in the elbow
* [[Subacromial bursitis]], giving shoulder pain, is the most common form of bursitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Fauci |editor1-first=Anthony S. |editor2-last=Langford |editor2-first=Carol A. |year=2010 |title=Harrison's Rheumatology |edition=Second |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing; Digital Edition |isbn=9780071741460 |pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Achilles bursitis]]
* [[Retrocalcaneal bursitis]]
* [[Ischial bursitis]], "weaver's bottom"
* [[Iliopsoas bursitis]]
* [[Pes anserine bursitis|Anserine bursitis]]

==Treatment==
It is important to differentiate between infected and non-infected bursitis. People may have surrounding cellulitis and systemic symptoms include a fever. The bursa should be aspirated to rule out an infectious process.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt;

Bursae that are not infected can be treated symptomatically with rest, ice, elevation, [[physiotherapy]], [[anti-inflammatory drug]]s and pain medication. Since bursitis is caused by increased friction from the adjacent structures, a compression bandage is not suggested because compression would create more friction around the joint. Chronic bursitis can be amenable to [[bursectomy]] and aspiration.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; Bursae that are [[infection|infected]] require further investigation and [[antibiotic]] therapy. Steroid therapy may also be considered.&lt;ref name="Ghelman2008"/&gt; In cases when all conservative treatment fails, surgical therapy may be necessary. In a bursectomy the bursa is cut out either [[endoscopically]] or with open surgery. The bursa grows back in place after a couple of weeks but without any inflammatory component.

&lt;!-- Cause, diagnosis, and pathophysiology --&gt;
Well over 200 [[virus strain]]s are implicated in causing the common cold, with [[rhinovirus]]es being the most common.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Full&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Cold and Runny Nose|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/community/for-patients/common-illnesses/colds.html|website=CDC|accessdate=4 February 2016|format=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201101449/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/community/for-patients/common-illnesses/colds.html|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; Risk factors include going to [[daycare]], [[Insomnia|not sleeping well]], and [[psychological stress]].&lt;ref name=CMAJ2014/&gt; The symptoms are mostly due to the body's [[immune]] response to the infection rather than to [[Tissue (biology)|tissue destruction]] by the viruses themselves.&lt;ref name=E112&gt;Eccles p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, those affected by [[influenza]] can show similar symptoms as people with a cold, but symptoms are usually more severe.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2014/&gt; Additionally, influenza is less likely to result in a [[runny nose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cold Versus Flu | date = 11 August 2016 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/coldflu.htm | accessdate = 5 January 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170106173600/https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/coldflu.htm | archivedate = 6 January 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical symptoms of a cold include a [[cough]], a [[runny nose]], [[nasal congestion]] and a [[sore throat]], sometimes accompanied by [[myalgia|muscle ache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[headache]], and [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]].&lt;ref name=E24&gt;Eccles p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%,&lt;ref name=CE11/&gt; while muscle ache occurs in about half.&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt; In adults, a [[fever]] is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children.&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt; The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying [[influenza]].&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt; While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in [[asymptomatic|asymptomatic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The color of the [[sputum]] or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progression===

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Illu conducting passages.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The common cold is a disease of the [[upper respiratory tract]].]]
The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the [[immune]] response to the virus.&lt;ref name=E112/&gt; The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human via [[ICAM-1|ICAM-1 receptors]] and the [[Cadherin related family member 3|CDHR3 receptor]] through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of [[inflammatory mediators]].&lt;ref name=E112/&gt; These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms.&lt;ref name=E112/&gt; It does not generally cause damage to the nasal [[epithelium]].&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt; The respiratory syncytial virus ([[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]]), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the [[lower respiratory tract]].&lt;ref name=E116&gt;Eccles p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; RSV does cause epithelium damage.&lt;ref name=E116/&gt; Human [[parainfluenza]] virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and [[bronchus|bronchi]].&lt;ref name=E122&gt;Eccles p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In young children when it affects the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] it may produce the symptoms of [[croup]] due to the small size of their airways.&lt;ref name=E122/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The distinction between viral [[upper respiratory tract infections]] is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, [[pharyngitis]] (the throat), and [[bronchitis]] (the lungs).&lt;ref name=CE11/&gt; However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected.&lt;ref name=CE11/&gt; The common cold is frequently defined as [[rhinitis|nasal inflammation]] with varying amount of throat inflammation.&lt;ref name=E51&gt;Eccles pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Self-diagnosis is frequent.&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt; Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed,&lt;ref name=E51/&gt; and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.&lt;ref name=Eccles2005/&gt;

==Prevention==
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures&lt;ref name=E209/&gt; such as [[hand washing]] and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used.&lt;ref name=E209/&gt; Isolation or [[quarantine]] is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. [[Vaccination]] has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they [[Viral evolution|mutate]] rapidly.&lt;ref name=E209/&gt; Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lawrence DM | title = Gene studies shed light on rhinovirus diversity | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | page =  278| date = May 2009 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70123-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children.&lt;ref name=CochP11&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jefferson T, Del Mar CB, Dooley L, Ferroni E, Al-Ansary LA, Bawazeer GA, van Driel ML, Nair S, Jones MA, Thorning S, Conly JM | title = Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 7 | page =  CD006207| date = July 2011 | pmid = 21735402 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub4 | editor1-last = Jefferson | editor1-first = Tom }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the addition of [[antiviral drug|antivirals]] or [[antibacterial]]s to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown.&lt;ref name=CochP11/&gt; Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater [[social distance]].&lt;ref name=CochP11/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The common cold is the most common human [[disease]]&lt;ref name=E1/&gt; and affects people all over the globe.&lt;ref name=Text2007/&gt; Adults typically have two to three infections annually,&lt;ref name=CE11/&gt; and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children).&lt;ref name="AFP07"/&gt; Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.&lt;ref name="E78"&gt;Eccles p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans and [[Inuit]] are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as [[otitis media]] than Caucasians.&lt;ref name="Medscape" /&gt; This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Medscape" /&gt;

While the cause of the common cold has only been identified since the 1950s, the disease has been with humanity throughout history.&lt;ref name="Eccles p. 3"/&gt; Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian [[Ebers papyrus]], the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cold | title=Cold | accessdate=12 January 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024173928/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cold | archivedate=24 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Common Cold Unit]] was set up by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with [[interferon]] during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease,&lt;ref name="pmid2438740"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tyrrell DA | title = Interferons and their clinical value | journal = Rev.

The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of [[Zinc gluconate#Zinc and the common cold|zinc gluconate lozenges]] in the [[prophylaxis]] and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Al-Nakib W | title = Prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds with zinc gluconate lozenges | journal = J Antimicrob Chemother | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 893–901 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3440773 | doi = 10.1093/jac/20.6.893 | last2 = Higgins | first2 = P.G. | last3 = Barrow | first3 = I. | last4 = Batstone | first4 = G. | last5 = Tyrrell | first5 = D.A.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world.&lt;ref name="EcclesPg_a" /&gt; In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year.

As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children.

[[File:Cutman treating fighter.jpg|thumb|Cutman Jacob "Stitch" Duran administers treatment to fighter Wladimir Klitschko.]]A '''cutman''' is a person responsible for preventing and treating physical damage to a fighter during the breaks between rounds of a [[Contact sport#Full-contact|full contact]] match such as a [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] or a [[mixed martial arts]] bout. Cutmen typically handle [[hematoma|swelling]], [[nosebleed]]s and [[laceration]]s. In addition to degrading a fighter's performance, the rules of combat sports stipulate that these injuries can be a cause for premature match stoppage, counting as a loss to the injured fighter. The cutman is therefore essential to the fighter, and can be a decisive factor in the outcome of the match.

The compensation for cutmen varies, generally staying within 10–15% of fighter's [[prize money]].&lt;ref name=souza&gt;Whisler, John (2004). [http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/boxing/stories/MYSA053004.1C.Souza.1165db35b.html "Battered boxers want Joe Souza in their corner"]. www.mysanantonio.com. URL last accessed May 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For many fighters on a low budget, the cutman duties are performed by their [[cornerman]]. While most athletic commissions require cutmen to be licensed, there is usually no formal training or certification required. Most cutmen learn their trade through [[apprenticeship]] and [[Autodidacticism|self-education]].

Unlike boxing, cutmen for mixed martial arts events are generally provided by the promotion, rather than the fighter's corner. This is to prevent allegations of "greasing" (applying [[petroleum jelly]] to areas other than the forehead, which provides an unfair advantage in grappling situations).

Cutmen should not be confused with the fight physician, an official who monitors the health of the fighters and whose task is closer to that of a neutral [[referee]].  The fight physician provides medical advice, monitors the safety of both fighters in accordance with regulations or law, and evaluates their ability to continue fighting.

==Treatments==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DaveTennyKathyCollins.jpeg|thumb|right|Cutman Dave Tenny working on Cathy "Wildcat" Collins during a boxing bout.]] --&gt;

Before the fight, cutmen will usually put [[petroleum jelly]] on the most likely areas of impact, especially the fighter's face, making the skin more elastic and slippery, and hence less likely to tear. It is not considered good practice to use large amounts of petroleum jelly, since during the fight it is likely to end up on the gloves of the opponent, and later in the eyes of the fighter if the opponent lands a [[punch (strike)|punch]] close to their eyes. Cutmen might also tape fighters' hands, which helps protect the bones and tendons. Wraps are used during training but are illegal during competition,  though people still commonly use the term "wrap" in error to describe the taping method of using gauze and tape. 

During the fight, cutmen try to control any swelling or bleeding during the breaks between rounds. Since cutmen are not doctors, and have a very short period of time to treat the fighter, their treatments are limited to advanced [[first aid]] treatments.

===Swelling===
[[File:Enswell.JPG|thumb|right|A standard enswell used by cutmen to reduce swelling from facial injuries.]]
[[hematoma|Swelling]] is usually associated with facial [[hematoma]]s (bruises), and is traditionally reduced by applying firm pressure with a chilled enswell or an ice bag on top of the area of [[physical trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref name=tenny&gt;Tenny, Dave (2002). [http://www.thecutman.com/tennyarticle.htm "How to Use Enswell and Take Care of a Nosebleed"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427200330/http://www.thecutman.com/tennyarticle.htm |date=2006-04-27 }}. www.thecutman.com. URL last accessed March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The cutman presses the enswell against a fighter's skin to cool and reduce swelling from injuries, especially in areas around the eyes where swelling can impair vision. Since the time between rounds is very short, cutmen try to apply the enswell right away and hold it as long as they can, but a common mistake is using the enswell to push directly on the swollen area in an attempt to disperse it or move it into a safer place such as away from the eye.&lt;ref name=guzman&gt;Guzman, Trinidad; Duran, Jacob (2004). [http://www.fightnews.com/guzman0038.htm "Boxing through the eyes of a cutman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504010211/http://www.fightnews.com/guzman0038.htm |date=2006-05-04 }}. www.fightnews.com. URL last accessed March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatment will not move the hematoma, and may disrupt the microscopic [[blood vessels]] under the skin, thus causing an increase in bleeding and enlargement of the swelled area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Cuts===
Cuts ([[wound#Types of wound|lacerations]]) are the primary focus of the cutman because unless the bleeding is stopped promptly, the fight physician may stop the fight and declare that the injured fighter has lost the match. Physicians also will stop a match for a laceration that is perpendicular to the eye. The most common area of the face to be cut is around the eye. Cuts are treated by applying a cold towel to clean and simultaneously cool the area of the cut, causing a decrease in blood flow. A cotton swab soaked in [[epinephrine]] is applied with pressure to decrease blood flow even more, and Avitene is put into the cut to [[Coagulation|coagulate]] the blood.&lt;ref name=souza/&gt; A cutman might also cover the area with petroleum jelly to prevent further damage.

===Nosebleeds===
[[File:BoxingNosebleed.jpeg|thumb|PFC Raelina Shinn (left) battles on with a nosebleed during the first female fight in the Armed Forces Boxing Championships.]]

Most [[nosebleed]]s occur near the opening of the [[Human nose|nose]]. To stop the bleeding, cutmen generally apply a cotton swab soaked in adrenaline hydrochloride to the damaged area, while simultaneously pressing the nostril against the cotton swab with the other hand. Once the bleeding has stopped, the area is chilled with an ice pack or an enswell. The fighter is usually instructed to breathe through the mouth during the treatment.&lt;ref name = tenny/&gt;

A [[broken nose]] is a more difficult case, and can be detected by a heavy flow of dark colored blood from the nose. The bleeding is generally treated the same way; however, the fighter is usually instructed to avoid swallowing blood as it may induce [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]], and the cutman is more likely to consult the ringside physician to ensure the fighter's safety.

==Tools==

===Equipment===
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Enswell.jpeg|thumb|175px|right|The enswell is the most characteristic tool of the cutman's trade.]] --&gt;
* '''Enswell''', sometimes called ''end-swell'', ''endswell'', ''stop-swell'', ''no-swell'' or simple ''eye iron'', is a small piece of metal with a handle. It is traditionally kept on ice and is used to cool the area of a [[bruise]] or a cut by applying direct pressure to [[Vasoconstriction|decrease the blood flow]] to the area.
* '''[[Cotton swab]]s''' are used to apply medications to the fighter's wounds. While some cutmen use ready-made cotton swabs, others make their own.&lt;ref name=souza/&gt; It has been suggested that the practice of past cutmen's in keeping cotton swabs behind their ears or in their mouths is unsanitary and unprofessional.&lt;ref name=guzman /&gt;
*'''[[Ice pack]]s''' are used to cool [[bruise]]s, cuts and sprains, and to keep the enswell cold.
*'''[[Petroleum jelly]]''' is put on the cuts and most likely areas of impact to make the skin more elastic and slippery, and hence less likely to tear. Some cutmen cover cuts with homemade [[salve]] containing a mix of petroleum jelly and adrenaline chloride, so that adrenaline keeps getting applied to the wound during the bout. Also, [[perspiration]] from above the eyes will be prevented from reaching the eyes by applying petroleum jelly to the eyebrows.
*'''[[gauze|Gauze pads]]''' are used to dry cuts.
*'''[[Medical gloves]]''' are worn by the cutman to limit the fighter's exposure to [[infection|infectious]] matter, as well as limiting the cutman's exposure to [[blood]].

===Medications===
Cutmen used to create their own medications, and the recipes were passed from masters to apprentices as trade secrets. Today, the use of various medications in sports is highly controlled, and most cutmen use only two or three standard medications from the list below.
*'''Adrenaline hydrochloride''' (also ''adrenaline'' [or ''epinephrine''] chloride'', usually a 1&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;1000 solution): Applied topically to decrease blood flow. This is arguably the most common medication used by cutmen.&lt;ref name=guzman/&gt;
*'''Avitene''' (microfibrillar collagen hemostat): [[Coagulation|Coagulant]] used for bleeding cuts. Usually used in a powder form.  It works best when the surface is dry.&lt;ref&gt;Davol, Inc. [http://www.davol.com/HTMLFiles/Hemostasis/AviteneMicroInst1.html Avitene Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat Instructions for Use] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313025545/http://www.davol.com/HTMLFiles/Hemostasis/AviteneMicroInst1.html |date=2006-03-13 }}. ''www.davol.com''. URL last accessed March 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The treatment includes covering the affected area with Avitene, and applying moderate pressure with dry gauze.
*'''[[Thrombin]]''': Coagulant used when the blood is removed and the surface is dry.
*'''[[Surgicel]]''' and '''[[Gelfoam]]''': Two other substances also used for coagulation, although less frequently than Avitene or Thrombin.
*'''[[Monsel's solution]]''': This widely outlawed [[hemostatic]] quickly stops the blood flow by chemically [[cauterization|cauterizing]] the [[biological tissue|tissues]] surrounding the cut, while generating severe [[granulation tissue|scar tissue]]. The application of a lead-based hemostatic can be recognized by the appearance of a dark ring of damaged tissue around the cut. However, Monsel's solution is an iron (sub)sulfate solution that contains no lead, contrary to popular misconception.&lt;ref name="guzman" /&gt;

==Notable cutmen==
* [[Chuck Bodak]], a legendary [[boxing]] cutman who worked with over 50 World Champions including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Tommy Hearns]], [[Julio Cesar Chavez]], [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Oscar De La Hoya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/chuck-bodak-passes-3314 Chuck Bodak passes] Fightnews.com, February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

*Rafael Garcia, a legendary cutman known for working with [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]]

==Cutmen in popular culture==

===Film and TV===

* In the 1976 film ''[[Rocky]]'', during [[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]]'s fight with heavyweight champion [[Apollo Creed]], Rocky's cutman is Al, played by former boxing trainer [[Al Silvani]] (credited as Al Salvani). During the fight, between the 14th and 15th rounds, Rocky's eyes have swollen so badly that he cannot see, so Salvani famously cuts Rocky's eyelid to restore his vision. He also serves as Rocky's cutman in both ''[[Rocky II]]'' and ''[[Rocky III]]''.
* In the 2006 film ''[[Rocky Balboa]]'', Jacob Duran portrays a cutman in the corner of Mason Dixon.
* In the 2015 film ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', Jacob Duran portrays himself as the cutman in the corner of Adonis Creed.

===Video games===
* ''[[Fight Night Round 2]]'' and ''[[Fight Night: Round 3]]'' by [[Electronic Arts]] allow the player to perform the cutman duties during the breaks between rounds. The player has a very limited time to apply enswell to the bruises and treat cuts with adrenaline-soaked cotton swabs.

===Fiction===
* ''Million Dollar Baby: Stories from the Corner'' by [[F.X. Toole]] contains several short stories on the lives of cutmen and their relationships with the fighters.

Combustible tobacco cigarettes reach about 900°C during a puff and smoulder at about 400°C between puffs.[23] The burning process, substances emitted and their levels vary at different temperatures.[38] Distillation, the process during which nicotine and aromas are transferred from tobacco to smoke, occurs below 300°C; pyrolysis occurs at about 300°C–700°C, entails the decomposition of biopolymers, proteins, and other organic materials and generates the majority of substances emitted in smoke; and combustion occurs above 750°C and results in the generation of carbon dioxide, CO and water.[38] HeatSticks are heated to a maximum of 350°C,[19] a temperature sufficient to enable pyrolytic decomposition of some organic materials. Formation of toxic volatile organic compounds, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, via dehydration and oxidation of the humectants, propylene glycol and glycerin, have been reported in e-cigarette aerosols at similar temperatures as IQOS.[39–42] In addition, flavouring chemicals in e-cigarettes undergo thermal degradation and contribute significantly to levels of toxic aldehydes emitted in e-cigarette aerosol.[43] Since the constituents of HeatSticks may be different from that of combustible cigarettes, including flavourants and additives, it is plausible that the IQOS aerosol may contain substances not present in tobacco smoke.}}&lt;!--Please note that this article is licensed under CC-BY 4.0, and the text is thus usable in Wikipedia; quote added as content was challenged--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Charcoal#History|ancient]] process is called [[charring]],&lt;ref name="char"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=29535257 |url=https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2018/02/20/tobaccocontrol-2017-054104 |laysummary=https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/heat-not-burn-smokeless-tobacco-product-may-not-be-as-harm-free-as-claimed/ |laysource=BMJ |year=2018 |last1=Davis |first1=Barbara |title=IQOS: Evidence of pyrolysis and release of a toxicant from plastic |journal=Tobacco Control |pages=tobaccocontrol-2017-054104 |last2=Williams |first2=Monique|last3=Talbot |first3=Prue |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2017-054104 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-31 |quote=Charring due to pyrolysis (a form of organic matter thermochemical decomposition) was observed in the tobacco plug after use.

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] studies of the health effects of low levels of [[ionizing radiation]], in particular the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] and mortality from various forms of [[cancer]], have been carried out in different population groups exposed to such radiation. These have included survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, workers at [[nuclear reactor]]s, and medical patients treated with [[X-rays]].

==Life span studies of atomic bomb survivors==

[[File:HHPS Figure 4-4.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1. From Preston et al.:&lt;ref name="2003 Preston" /&gt; Solid cancer dose-response function average over gender for attained age 70 after exposure at age 30. The solid straight-line is the [[linear slope]] estimate; the points are [[dosing|dose]]-category-specific ERR estimates; the dashed curve is a smoothed estimate that is derived from the points; and the dotted curves indicate upper and lower one-stand-error bounds on the smoothed estimate.]]
Survivors of the atomic bomb explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan have been the subjects of a Life Span Study (LSS), which has provided valuable epidemiological data.

The LSS population went through several changes:&lt;br /&gt;
* 1945 - There were some 93,000 individuals, either living in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan.
* 1950 - An additional 37,000 were registered by this time, for a total of 130,000 LSS members.

However, some 44,000 individuals were censured or excluded from the LSS project, so there remained about 86,000 people who were followed through the study.  There is a gap in knowledge of the earliest cancer that developed in the first few years after the war, which impacts the assessment of [[leukemia]] to an important extent and for solid cancers to a minor extent.  Table 1 shows summary statistics of the number of persons and deaths for different dose groups. These comparisons show that the doses that were received by the LSS population overlap strongly with the doses that are of concern to NASA Exploration mission (i.e., 50 to 2,000 [[Sievert|milliSieverts]] (mSv)).

The [[BEIR]] VII Report&lt;ref name=BEIR /&gt; contains an extensive review of data sets from human populations, including nuclear reactor workers and patients who were treated with radiation.

A meta-analysis at specific cancer sites, including [[breast cancer|breast]], [[lung cancer|lung]], and leukemia, has also been performed.&lt;ref name=BEIR /&gt;  These studies require adjustments for [[photon energy]], [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]-rate, and country of origin as well as adjustments made in single population studies.  Table 4 shows the results that are derived from Preston et al.&lt;ref name="2002 Preston"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=DL|author2=Mattsson, A |author3=Holmberg, E |author4=Shore, R |author5=Hildreth, NG |author6= Boice JD, Jr |title=Radiation effects on breast cancer risk: a pooled analysis of eight cohorts.|journal=Radiation research|date=August 2002|volume=158|issue=2|pages=220–35|pmid=12105993|jstor=10.2307/3580776|doi=10.1667/0033-7587(2002)158[0220:reobcr]2.0.co;2|bibcode=2002RadR..158..220P}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a meta-analysis of breast cancer risks in eight populations, including the atomic-bomb survivors.  The median ERR varies by slightly more than a factor of two, but [[confidence level]]s significantly overlap.  Adjustments for photon energy or dose-rate and fractionation have not been made.  These types of analysis lend confidence to risk assessments as well as showing the limitations of such data sets.

Of special interest to NASA is the dependence on age at exposure of low-LET cancer risk projections. The BEIR VII report prefers models that show less than a 25% reduction in risk over the range from 35 to 55 years, while [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements|NCRP]] Report No. 132&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=NCRP|title=NPRC Report No. 132: Recommendations of dose limits for low Earth orbit|year=2000|publisher=NCRP|location=Bethesda, MD|url=http://www.ncrponline.org/Publications/Press_Releases/132press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows about a two-fold reduction over this range.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">The '''Family Health Care Decisions Act''' is a statute adopted in [[New York (state)|New York]] state in 2010 that had been pending before the legislature since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/149/story/441121.html Long-ignored legislation would ease suffering], ''The Buffalo News'', Sept. 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute was approved by the [[New York State Senate]] in July, 2009. The legislation was introduced by state senator [[Thomas Duane]] of [[Manhattan]]. It was signed into law by Gov. David Paterson on March 16, 2010. &lt;ref name="NYGOV"&gt;[http://www.state.ny.us/governor/press/031610FHCDA.html], ''Press Release'', March 17 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law adds new Articles 29-CC and 29-CCC to the Public Health Law and amends other existing sections of the laws of the State. It allows the relatives of incapacitated patients to make medical decisions for their family members in the absence of a [[living will]] or [[health care proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=599056&amp;category=OPINION&amp;newsdate=6/19/2007 State needs Family Health Care Decisions Act], ''Albany Times-Union'', June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, all other states except for [[Missouri]] permit such surrogacy.  Advocates have called the bill the "most important piece of medical legislation since lawmakers legalized health care proxies in 1990."&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/09/06/2009-09-06_finally_give_ny_families_endoflife_decisionmaking_power.html Finally give N.Y. families end-of-life decisionmaking power], ''New York Daily News'', September 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purposes and scope==

Before this law went into effect, the only legal rights that a husband or wife had in New York regarding a spouse who cannot make medical decisions is to choose whether he or she should be [[Do not resuscitate|resuscitated]] after a cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;  The goal of this FHCDA is to guarantee that family members have increased control over their relatives' health.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;  

Among the safeguard provided in the bill are rules that require the capacity of the patient must be assessed and reassessed by two physicians, that spouses rely upon the stated wishes of the incapacitated patient and that life-sustaining care be curtailed only when a patient is either terminally ill, won't regain consciousness, or has an irreversible medical condition that will result in great suffering.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Two features of the legislation proved controversial prior to enactment.  One allowed [[domestic partners]] to act as surrogates, a provision that was opposed by those concerned that it would buttress the claims of those who favored [[gay marriage]].  This concern became a moot point after New York recognized same-sex marriage.  Another was the absence of any provision guaranteeing that the welfare of [[fetuses]] will be considered when making surrogacy decisions for incapacitated pregnant women.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

Dr. [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], a backer of the legislation, argued that it "would give New Yorkers a right that many believe they already possess."&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Supporters of the law include the Healthcare Association of New York State&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanys.org/news/index.cfm?storyid=943 HANYS Advocates for Family Health Care Decisions Act]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Compassion &amp; Choices]].

The New York State Right to Life Committee had opposed early proposed versions of the Family Health Care Decisions Act, alleging that they did not protect the rights of a surrogate who decides to choose life-saving medical treatment for the patient she or he represents, instead allowing the patient’s health care provider to deny the requested treatment based on “quality of life” factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifenews.com/state1702.html New York Pro-Life Group Opposes Involuntary Euthanasia Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2007 the bill was revised to require health care providers who disagree with a surrogate choice for life-saving treatment nevertheless to provide it, pending either transfer to a willing health care provider or judicial review; thereafter, the Right to Life Committee endorsed and lobbied for the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysrighttolife.org/position_papers_and_press_statements “March 16, 2010: NYSRTLC Hails Signing Into Law of ‘Family Health Care Decisions Act’”] ; [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/health/policy/18decisions.html?_r=1  “Law Dictates Who Decides on Care for the Incapable”] , “New York Times”, March 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film/video-based therapy''' involves making movies with clients. 
It draws from several disciplines from [[cinema therapy]], [[expressive therapy]], [[narrative therapy]], [[art therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/arts-and-health/201304/defining-art-therapy-in-the-21st-century | title=Defining Art Therapy in the 21st Century | work=Psychology Today | date=April 2, 2013 | accessdate=May 23, 2016 | author=Cathy Malchiodi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital storytelling]], and [[phototherapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phototherapy-centre.com/related-techniques/|title=Related Techniques|work=PhotoTherapy, Therapeutic Photography, &amp; LÖÖPS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires a collaboration to integrate the many dynamic aspects of art and medicine. 
Joshua Lee Cohen, author and co-editor of ''Video and Filmmaking as Psychotherapy: Research and Practice'' (published by Routledge in 2015), helped to establish a collaborative effort in forming film/video-based therapy.  This form of therapy is about making films with clients, as opposed to [[cinema therapy]], which involves watching films.

Film/video-based therapy is used in both research and practice. It has several names. Each name  has a slightly different purpose for each population.

Therapeutic filmmaking is used for both veterans and therapists and is left intentionally ambiguous, so that the military will not be intimidated by the stigma of a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/military/article40517652.html | title=JBLM veterans focus on filmmaking | work=The News Tribune | date=October 20, 2015 | accessdate=May 23, 2016 |author=Adam Ashton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of pressure to call it "therapy" opens up a space to allow for new and old healthy memories to form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmandvideobasedtherapy.com/ Video and Filmmaking as Psychotherapy: Research and Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video remix therapy==

Video art therapy is used primarily in private practice with art therapists, drama therapists, and  other expressive art therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Jamerson JL|title=Expressive remix therapy: using digital media art in therapeutic group sessions children and adolescents|pmid=24494383|journal=Creat Nurs.|year=2013|volume=19|issue=4|pages=182–8|doi=10.1891/1078-4535.19.4.182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital storytelling]] is also used in collaboration with film/video-based therapy and is used primarily for education.

Storytelling is an indigenous and ancient way for people to relate to one another and to understand the mysteries of life. Using modern technology, artists have used film and video for expressing ancient and modern images and sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Alders, A., Beck, L., Allen, P. B., &amp; Mosinski, B.

Film/video-based therapy is a collaboration between clinicians and practitioners in [[art therapy]], [[expressive therapy]], phototherapy, [[psychotherapy]], digital storytelling and other mental health and academic fields of study and practice. Currently art therapists, expressive therapists, psychologists, masters level practitioners, psychiatrists,  anthropologists, filmmakers, academics, and other clinicians have contributed to this collaborative effort in building a global community to help further define this field.  The use of film and video in, or as, therapy, has a decades-long history in practice. Early work in this field included the post-World War II use of experimental, non-narrative films to calm veterans suffering from shell shock. The 1970s saw boys in a group creating short films together to foster group cohesion, mastery skills, and better communication. With the advent of portable video equipment in the 1970s, female artists began turning the camera on themselves, making themselves the object of their own gaze.

There is a dearth of literature on the theory and practice of using film/video production as therapy and the multidisciplinary practitioners who support its use. Copious literature exists discussing the use of related media in a therapeutic context, such as photography, writing, drawing, music, and drama, but this body of literature is virtually vacant of film/video as a therapeutic medium.

Despite the fact that there is little writing in this area, numerous practitioners from around North America and Europe are quietly working with film/video-based therapy – often independently, as the community of practitioners is still quite small and geographically scattered.

This is an attempt to bridge that gap and bring people together as a global community and new research and practices are emerging. 
Cohen will be the program chair for the American Psychological Association's Division 31 and 46 in Washington DC in 2017 where authors are welcome to attend this conference from around the world.

==Bipolar disorder==

Film/video-based therapy is also being used with [[virtual reality]] and specifically designed to treat bipolar disorder through somatic techniques which is different from the cognitive/exposure therapy being used today.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-using-virtual-reality-to-treat-bipolar-disorder-and-phobias | title=Scientists are using virtual reality to treat bipolar disorder and phobias | work=ScienceAlert | date=17 July 2015 | accessdate=May 23, 2016 | author=David Nield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/thecure/2015/07/treating-bipolar-disorder-virtual-reality-150713113149119.html | title=Treating Bipolar Disorder With Virtual Reality | work=Al Jazeera English | date=14 July 2015 | accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medications and therapy may be necessary to use before one can take on triggers that could overwhelm the nervous system. If one is in a manic state and exposed to triggers before regulated, one could be re traumatized and put into a psychosis. To gain mastery of this skill, one would need to have a healthy environment in the real world before entering a virtual one.

==Trauma==

One theory as to why film/video-based therapy works with trauma, may be  due to the reprocessing that happens during the final moments of editing, similar to EMDR. In the moment of making a film, one can use somatic experiencing which was designed to regulate the autonomic nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yardenkerem.com/#!somatic-experience/c1pbm Somatic Experience], [http://www.filmandvideobasedtherapy.com/kerem-abstract/ Felt Sense Video Art Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt; Telling one's story can help to reprocess old memories while avoiding triggers or reprocessing them in a new way using the technology.  There is some research in this area yet, but it is still in development.

==Culture==

Film/video-based therapy is also about building a therapeutic relationship with a person and a wider support group or community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathymalchiodi.com/about/what-is-art-therapy/ What is Art Therapy?]&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with any technology, whether virtual reality&lt;ref name=ScienceAlert/&gt; or digital storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storycenter.org/ Storycenter.org], [http://www.yourdigitalstorytellingproject.com/ yourdigitalstorytellingproject.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  the theory remains the same, film/video-based therapy is about using technology for human purposes and building relationships to others and nature. Technology is just the language for understanding, appreciating, and honoring our nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmandvideobasedtherapy.com/josh-cohen/2014/8/23/the-dalai-lama-on-technology The Dalai Lama on technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''GnRH modulator''', or '''GnRH receptor modulator''', is a type of [[medication]] which [[receptor modulator|modulate]]s the [[GnRH receptor]], the [[biological target]] of the [[hypothalamic hormone]] [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH).&lt;ref name="pmid23887363"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Riggs MM, Bennetts M, van der Graaf PH, Martin SW |title= Integrated pharmacometrics and systems pharmacology model-based analyses to guide GnRH receptor modulator development for management of endometriosis |journal= CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol |volume=1 |issue= |pages= e11 |year=2012 |pmid= 23887363 |pmc= 3606940 |doi= 10.1038/psp.2012.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RacowskySchlegel2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Catherine Racowsky |author2=Peter N.

These medications may be '''[[GnRH analogue]]s''' like [[leuprorelin]] and [[cetrorelix]] – [[peptide]]s that are structurally related to GnRH – or [[small-molecule]]s like [[elagolix]], which are structurally distinct from GnRH analogues.

GnRH modulators affect the [[secretion]] of the [[gonadotropin]]s, [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), which in turn affects the [[gonad]]s, influencing their function and hence [[fertility]] as well as the [[biosynthesis|production]] of [[sex steroid]]s, including that of [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] in women and of [[testosterone]] in men. As such, GnRH modulators can also be described as [[progonadotropic]] or [[antigonadotropic]], depending on whether they act to increase or decrease gonadotropins.

The '''Great Man-Made River''' ('''GMR''', {{lang|ar|النهر الصناعي العظيم}}) is a network of pipes that supplies [[water]] to the [[Sahara]] in [[Libya]], from the [[Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System]] [[fossil water|fossil aquifer]]. It is the world's largest irrigation project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/2008/default.aspx Guinness World Records 2008 Book]. {{ISBN|978-1-904994-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, it is the largest [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|underground network]] of [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] ({{convert|2820|km}})&lt;ref&gt;Keys, D., 2011, Libya Tale of Two Fundamentally Different Cities, BBC Knowledge Asia Edition, Vol.3 Issue 7&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] in the world. It consists of more than 1,300 [[water well|wells]], most more than 500 m [[Depth in a well|deep]], and supplies 6,500,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of [[fresh water]] per day to the cities of [[Tripoli]], [[Benghazi]], [[Sirte]] and elsewhere. The late Libyan Leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] described it as the "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-technology.net/projects/gmr/ Water-Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, efforts to find [[Petroleum|oil]] in southern Libya led to the discovery of large quantities of fresh water underground. The Great Man-made River Project (GMRP) was conceived in the late 1960s and work on the project began in 1984. The project's construction was divided into five phases. The first phase required 85 million m³ of excavation and was inaugurated on 28 August 1991. The second phase (dubbed ''First water to Tripoli'') was inaugurated on 1 September 1996.

The project is owned by the Great Man-Made River Project Authority and was funded by the [[Gaddafi government]]. The primary contractor for the first phases was Dong Ah Consortium and the present main contractor is Al Nahr Company Ltd.

The imported goods were made in Korea and destined to the construction of the GMR arrived by sea via the entry port of [[Brega]] ([[Gulf of Sidra]]). Cathodic corrosion protection on the pipeline was supplied by an Australian company, AMAC Corrosion Protection, based in Melbourne and delivered via Port of Benghazi.&lt;ref&gt;Hands-on; AMAC's Purchasing Manager.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of goods were made in Libya.

The total cost of the project is projected at more than [[US dollar|US$]]25 billion.&lt;ref name=Scholl&gt;{{cite web|last=Scholl|first=Adam|title=Map Room: Hidden Waters|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/map-room|publisher=World Policy Journal|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Libya has completed the work to date without the financial support of major countries or loans from world banks. Since 1990 [[UNESCO]] has provided training to engineers and technicians involved with the project.

The fossil [[aquifer]] from which this water is being supplied is the [[Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System]]. It accumulated during the last ice age and is not currently being replenished. If 2007 rates of retrieval are not increased, the water could last a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200701/seas.beneath.the.sands.htm Article from Saudi Aramco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805112417/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200701/seas.beneath.the.sands.htm |date=2014-08-05 }} January/February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.unep.net/atlas/webatlas.php?id=377 UN Environment Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Independent estimates indicate that the aquifer could be depleted of water in as soon as 60 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0823/Libya-s-Qaddafi-taps-fossil-water-to-irrigate-desert-farms/%28page%29/2 Libya's Qaddafi taps 'fossil water' to irrigate desert farms - CSMonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts say that the costs of the $25 billion groundwater extraction system are 10% those of desalination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/04/01/libya/ Colonel Qaddafi and the Great Man-made River – Water Matters - State of the Planet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henrik Sillem''' (12 August 1866, [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 13 July 1907, [[Courmayeur]], [[Italy]]) was a Dutch jurist, mountaineer and sports [[shooting|shooter]].

== Personal life and education ==
Henrik Sillem was the son of Johann Gottlieb Sillem, banker with [[Hope &amp; Co.]] bankers, [[Amsterdam]]. His mother was [[Jonkheer|Jkvr.]] Judith Catharina Henriette Hoeufft.

Henrik Sillem studied law at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. He graduated as  Doctor of Law on May 8, 1891, with a thesis 'Het faillissement des verzekeraars' (Bankruptcy of insurance companies)' published by Roeloffzen en Hubner, Amsterdam in  1891.&lt;ref&gt;Academisch proefschrift 'Het faillissement des verzekeraars', uitgave Roeloffzen &amp; Hubner, Amsterdam, 1891. Herdruk: Kessinger Publishing, LaVergne, Tennessee, USA, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1891 he married in [[Arnhem]] jkvr. Susanna Catharina Beatrix des Tombe (born February 24, 1869, Arnhem - died November 6, 1948) the daughter of jonkheer François Joan Adriaan des Tombe and Beatrix Cruys. The couple had two sons, Francois Johann and Henrick (Boet) Sillem, before divorcing in 1897.

In 1902, in [[London]], Sillem married Bertha Johanna Eva Reuser, (1879-1971), daughter of Johann and Katharina Anna Reuser Schmolck.

Henrik Sillem worked in Amsterdam as a lawyer, legal advisor and public prosecutor.

==Olympic medalist ==
Together with his friend [[Solko van den Bergh]] and the Frenchman  [[François Monod]], Sillem initiated the first 'international shooting matches' (world championships in shooting) in 1897 in [[Lyon]]. These were the forerunners of the [[Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics|matches]] that were held in Paris in 1900, now considered to have been part of the Olympics. Sillem competed with the Dutch pistol team and won a [[bronze medal]].

==Mountaineer and explorer==
When he was 19, Sillem climbed the [[Matterhorn]] from the northern side, with FG Waller. In 1902 he reached an altitude of 6,400 m (21,000&amp;nbsp;ft) on [[Nun Kun|Nun]] in [[Kashmir]]. In 1905 he climbed the [[Aconcagua]] in the [[Andes]]. He also climbed [[Antarctica|Antarctica's]] [[Mount Kinsey]] and [[Mount Ellie]].

In March 1906, Henrik Sillem made the first ascent of the West Ridge of [[Mt Cook]] in [[New Zealand]] with guide [[Alexander and Peter Graham|Peter Graham]].

Sillem only reached the age of 41; in 1907 he fell while descending the [[Aiguille du Midi]] and was buried nearby, in [[Courmayeur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area''' program ('''HIDTA''') is a drug-prohibition enforcement program run by the [[Executive Office of the President|United States]] [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. It was established in 1990 after the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988]] was passed.

The mission of the program is "to enhance and coordinate America's drug-control efforts among local, state and [[FBI|Federal law enforcement]] agencies in order to eliminate or reduce [[drug trafficking]] and its harmful consequences in critical regions of the United States."

The term HIDTA also refers to each geographic location, usually a major city, county, or border crossing, in which the program has established a headquarters. These headquarters are placed in locations considered to be major drug trafficking zones. The five HIDTA offices along the [[United States–Mexico border]] are grouped into a single "Southwest Border HIDTA" unit. Twenty eight HIDTAs have been designated since the program began.

Each HIDTA is governed by a HIDTA Executive Board which includes representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the area of the HIDTA.  By law, each HIDTA Board is equally divided between federal law enforcement on the one side and state and local agencies on the other.

==In popular culture==
In popular culture, HIDTA was featured in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' entitled "Locomotion". It aired in the show's 15th year (2004–2005 season). The two primary homicide detectives visited the HIDTA Branch in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]].

Also, during episode 2 of ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'' the audience learns of Rustin Cohle's previous law enforcement history, including participation in the HIDTA program including detailing the effects and consequences of participating in such programs.

{{For|etymology|Storage tank}}
[[File:Shravanabelagola lake.JPG|thumb|right|[[Shravanabelagola]] lake in [[Karnataka]]]]

An '''irrigation tank''' or '''tank''' is an artificial  [[reservoir]] of any size. They are mainly found in [[India]]. (The word ''sagar''  refers to a  large lake, usually man-made).&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php
|title=Architecture on the Indian Subcontinent - glossary
|publisher=
|accessdate=2006-12-18 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also have a natural or man-made spring included as part of a structure. Tanks are part of an ancient tradition of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall and water from streams and rivers  for later use, primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing and ritual. Often a tank was constructed across a slope so to collect and store water by taking advantage of local mounds and depressions.&lt;ref name="Tank management"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/Rural/Dhan.htm
|title=Tank management
|publisher=rainwaterharvesting.org
|accessdate=2006-10-17 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tank use is especially critical in parts of [[South India]] without [[Perennial plant|perennial]] rainfall where water supply replenishment is dependent on a cycle of  dry seasons alternating with monsoon seasons.

==Tank design==
Water is considered a purifying and regenerative element in India, and is an essential element of prayer and ritual. Water is also revered because of its scarcity in western India where dry and monsoon seasons alternate and failure of the monsoon season means famine and death while plentiful water replacing irrigations sources is a time of rejoicing. This resulted in building water storage tanks that combined the practical and sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since ancient times, the design of water storage has been important in Indian architecture.  As early as 3000 BC, sophisticated systems of drains, wells and tanks were built to conserve and utilise water. Tank building as an art form began with the Hindus and developed under Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Culture/Archit/Stepw.html
|title=Architecture - Stepwells
|publisher=
|accessdate=2007-01-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the art of tank design is the large, geometically spectacular Stepped Tank at the Royal Center at the ruins of [[Vijayanagara]], the capital of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], surrounding the modern town of [[Hampi]].  It is lined with green [[diorite]] and has no [[Plumbing fixture#Inlets and drains|drain]]. The tank was filled by [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Village tanks==
[[File:குளம்.JPG|thumb|right|A tank in [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
[[Ralegaon Siddhi]] is an example of a village that revitalised its ancient tank system.
In 1975 the village was  [[drought]]-stricken.  The village  tank could not hold water as the earthen [[reservoir|embankment dam]] wall leaked. Work began with the [[percolation]] tank construction by the villagers who donated their labor to repair the embankment. Once this was fixed, the village's seven wells below the tank filled with water in the summer for the first time in memory. Now the village has a supply of water throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/Rural/Ralegan.htm
|title=Ralegan Siddhi : A village Transformed
|publisher=
|accessdate=2006-10-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple tanks==
Tanks known as "[[Pushkarni]]" or "[[Kalyani (well)|Kalyani]]" also known as "Kund" in Hindi are reservoirs with steps leading down to the water, generally found in South India, and sometimes constructed within the walls of a temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php
|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent - glossary
|publisher=Indian Architecture
|accessdate=2006-10-17 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bathing in the sacred waters of a temple tank was believed to cure worshippers of afflictions such as leprosy and blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.indiantemples.com/suntemple.html
|title=Sun Temples in India 
|publisher=TempleNet
|accessdate=2006-10-17 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many temple tanks are decaying and drying up today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060601/aplus.htm
|title=Ponds, tanks relics of a bygone era
|publisher=AmritsarPlus Online Edition
|accessdate=2006-10-17 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stepwells==

[[Stepwell]]s, also called ''bavdi'' ({{lang-hi|बावड़ी}}) or ''bavli'' ({{lang-hi|बावली}}), are [[water well|well]]s in which the water can be reached by descending a set of steps. They are most common in the west of India.

Stepwells were often used for leisure, providing relief from daytime heat. This led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features, often associated with dwellings and in urban areas. It also ensured their survival as monuments.

==Modern tank management==
The development of large-scale water management methods and hydroelectric generation have replaced much of the local efforts and community management of water. For example, the state of [[Karnataka]] has about 44,000 artificial wetlands locally constructed over many centuries. At least 328 are threatened today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://en.arocha.org/india/index5.html
|title=Bird monitoring at Rampura and Kalkere tanks
|publisher=aroche.org
|accessdate=2006-10-17 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recently a tank regeneration movement initiated by communities and [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGO) has arisen.&lt;ref name="Tank management"/&gt; Today, there are approximately 120,000 small-scale tanks, irrigating about 41,200&amp;nbsp;km² in semi-arid areas of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|13552012}} |doi=10.1023/A:1014420822465 |year=2001 |last1=Anbumozhi |first1=V. |last2=Matsumoto |first2=K. |last3=Yamaji |first3=E. |title=Towards Improved Performance of Irrigation Tanks in Semi-Arid Regions of India: Modernization Opportunities and Challenges |journal=Irrigation and Drainage Systems |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=293–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes about one third of the total irrigated land in South India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|2829920}} |doi=10.1080/02508069708686676 |title=Sustainable Development and Management of Tank Irrigation Systems in South India |year=1997 |last1=Arumugam |first1=N. |last2=Mohan |first2=S. |last3=Ramaprasad |first3=R. |journal=Water International |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=90–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.&lt;ref name="Clark-1985-69" /&gt;

At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.

The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.&lt;ref name="Clark-1985-69" /&gt;

The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade wind]]s and converging [[ocean current]]s.

The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as [[Scaevola (plant)|naupaka]], [[Thespesia populnea|milo]], and [[Casuarina equisetifolia|ironwood]].&lt;ref name="Clark-1985-69" /&gt;

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5&amp;nbsp;km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority by weight are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets. Much of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[Plastic particle water pollution|nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==

[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as [[bisphenol A]], [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]], and [[polystyrene]], [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leach leach] [[carcinogen]]ic or poisonous [[chemical]]s when they [[Biodegradation|break down]]. Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

==Cleanup efforts==
Multiple community-based cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to these efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Most of the efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have been led by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and their countless beach cleanup volunteers, however other groups, including Imi Pono No Ka 'Aina, Hawaii Rainbow Gatherings, "CITO" geocachers, Sierra Club Hawaii and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i have also helped coordinate occasional events.  In 2003, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 100 volunteers and removed over 50 tons (45 metric tonnes) of fishing nets and other marine debris from the beach. &lt;ref name=PBase&gt;{{cite web

'''Lake Rożnow''' ({{lang-pl|Jezioro Rożnowskie}})  is an [[artificial lake]], built in 1935&amp;ndash;1941. It is located in southernmost part of [[Poland]] ([[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]]). The lake was built in the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar period]] to regulate the [[Dunajec]] river flowing through the foothils of [[Beskid Mountains]]; and also, to provide electricity for the [[Rożnów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Rożnow]] Power Plant (''Elektrownia Rożnow'') built into the dam. The lake took two years to fill which took place during World War II, from mid 1941 until 1943. It was named after the village of [[Rożnów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Rożnow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tauron-ekoenergia.pl/elektrownie/energia-wodna/zew-krakow/Strony/elektrownia-wodna-roznow.aspx Elektrownia wodna Rożnów - TAURON Ekoenergia.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lake Rożnow was created not long before the [[invasion of Poland]], after a [[dam]] had been built on the 80th kilometre distance of the Dunajec river. It lies among the hills of the [[Island Beskids]], in [[Nowy Sącz County]], some 12 kilometers north of [[Nowy Sącz]]. The valley of the Dunajec narrows here, turning into a [[canyon]]. The lake has the shape of an irregular letter S, with length ranging from 18 to 20 kilometres, and width of 1 app. kilometre (in few spots, it widens to no more than 2 kilometres). The depth of the reservoir reaches up to 30 metres near the dam. The total area of Rożnow Lake ranges from 16 to 20 square kilometres. The [[shoreline]] is marked by numerous peninsulas and bays, located at the [[river mouth|mouths]] of several smaller rivers, which flow into the Dunajec. The lake is surrounded by forested hills, and its picturesque location makes it a very popular tourist center. Several tourisst villagers are located along Lake Rożnow: Tegoborze, Znamirowice, Zbyszyce, Bartkowa, Grodek nad Dunajcem, Tabaszowa, Rożnow.

Lake Rożnow has a small island, called Malpia Wyspa (Monkey Island). It used to be a hill with an ancient [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]], which was turned into an island in 1942, after the Dunajec valley had been flooded. Currently, Monkey Island serves as a bird reserve, with as many 165 bird species living here.

The idea of construction of a dam on the Dunajec river in Rożnow was born after the disastrous [[1934 flood in Poland]]. Due to lack of funds, the project was postponed until 1937, when first land purchases were made. The dam was built by a Polish-French company, which constructed a special settlement for the workers and engineers (the so-called French Colony), together with narrow gauge rail line to a stone quarry at Marcinkowice. Construction was interrupted after the [[Invasion of Poland]], but as early as November 1939, German authorities of the [[General Government]] decided to continue it, using Polish plans. The dam together with the power plant was completed in 1942. It is built from concrete, with the height of 44 meters, and the length of 550 meters.

'''Luisa Guidotti Mistrali''' (16 May 1932 - 6 July 1979) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] who worked in the missions in [[Zimbabwe]] and was a consecrated member from the Women's Medical Missions Association.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/95928|title=Servant of God Luisa Guidotti Mistrali|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guidotti tended to the ill in several hospitals across Zimbabwe and was even noted for taking care of [[Robert Mugabe|Robert Mugabe's]] mother on one occasion. Her work saw hospitals expand to treat a greater number of patients and her work was appreciated nationwide which in part led to charges against her being dropped after she was accused of treating a [[guerilla]] which she had in fact done.&lt;ref name=ND&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/2017/07/luisa-guidotti-mutokos-heroine/|title=Luisa Guidotti: Mutoko's own heroine|date=15 July 2017|publisher=News Day|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=The Herald|date=21 July 2015|title=Liberation war's Italian connection|accessdate=1 December 2017|url=http://www.herald.co.zw/liberation-wars-italian-connection/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her beatification process opened in 1995 in [[Modena]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Life==
Luisa Guidotti Mistrali was born in mid-1932 in [[Parma]] as the first of three children to Camillo Guidotti and Anna Mistrali. Her mother was a [[baroness]] from Parma and her father's side owned the [[Fabbrico]] castle in [[Reggio Emilia]] for four centuries.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Her mother died from an incurable disease in 1947 and her father decided to relocate with his children to [[Modena]] where her maternal aunt Maria assumed care for the three children. Her education was spent in Modena and she received a religious formation from [[Catholic Action]] whom she grew close to around that time.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In 1957 she had her first encounter with the Women's Medical Missions Association and later joined them as a consecrated member. Guidotti later enrolled in a medicine course and graduated in May 1960 in Parma. Her education then allowed her in 1962 to specialize in [[Radiology|radiological treatment]] at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]] in [[Rome]] where she graduated from on 12 December 1962.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Guidotti fostered a strong devotion to [[Saint Thomas More]] and chose him as her spiritual guide.

On 1 August 1966 she received the [[crucifix]] of the missionaries from the [[Archbishop of Modena]] Giuseppe Amici. Guidotti left for [[Chirundu, Zimbabwe|Chirundu]] on 9 August 1966 after having met with [[Pope Paul VI]] not long before that. Guidotti arrived in [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) on 10 August and began working in a hospital in the north close to [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Guidotti returned to her homeland in July 1967 and on 12 September at the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[convent]] in [[Metten Abbey|Metten]] in [[Germany]] became part of the Association in full. In February 1969 she moved to the Regina Coeli Mission Hospital on the [[Mozambique]] border after having been working in a hospital in [[Salisbury, Zimbabwe|Salisbury]] since she first arrived in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In December 1969 she joined the All Souls Mission north-east of the capital of [[Harare]] and later in 1975 returned to her homeland for another visit.

On 24 June 1976 a [[guerilla]] named Antony Nodo was injured during fierce fighting and came to the hospital in need of urgent medical attention. Guidotti arranged for both a diagnosis and treatment for Nodo but was arrested for this on 28 June after the government alleged that she was aiding and abetting guerilla forces. The [[Red Cross]] leapt to her defense requesting her immediate release. Guidotti was acquitted of these charges on 24 August and returned to her hospital to work acting as if the arrest never occurred; but she exercised due diligence so as to ensure she was not arrested and removed from her work once again.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; But her offering medical treatment to [[Freedom fighter|freedom fighters]] irritated the Rhodesian forces. In 1978 she tended to the severe [[hypertensive crisis]] of [[Robert Mugabe|Robert Mugabe's]] mother.&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;&lt;ref name=TH/&gt;

==Death==
During dawn on 6 July 1979 she set off in a Red Cross ambulance van to go and operate on a pregnant woman but was shot dead at about 10:00am. En route government forces stopped the van at a checkpoint at which point bursts of gunfire from [[machine guns]] came from both sides of the road from two soldiers which struck her: it severed her [[femoral artery]] and caused her to die from excessive bleeding.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ND/&gt; Guidotti was going from the hospital to the pregnant woman's home when she was forced to stop at a checkpoint. Soldiers were there since one of their own had been shot dead there. Guidotti saw no road blocks so waited and then thought she could leave so drove off and turned right to get to the woman's home. It was then that the commandant gave the order to fire with three shots from one soldier and one from another. Guidotti was bleeding in her seat and said to them: "I am a doctor. Why are you shooting me?"&lt;ref name=TH/&gt; The [[Archbishop of Harare]] [[Patrick Fani Chakaipa]] celebrated her funeral [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on 12 July though her remains were later relocated to the [[Modena Cathedral]] on 23 October 1988.

The All Souls' Mission Hospital became known as the Luisa Guidotti Hospital later in 1983.&lt;ref name=ND/&gt; Robert Mugabe in 1983 unveiled a plaque dedicated to her at the hospital and was present with his mother whom Guidotti had treated back in 1978. Mugabe also related in his remarks how he had met with Guidotti once in 1974 and was left impressed with her and her work.&lt;ref name=TH/&gt;

==Beatification process==
The beatification process opened in Modena after the forum for the diocesan process was transferred in 1995 from Harare to Modena. The official commencement for the cause came under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 21 April 1995 after she had been titled as a [[Servant of God]] and the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared the "[[nihil obstat]]" to the cause meaning there were no objections for its initiation. The diocesan process was inaugurated in Modena at the cathedral on 20 October 1996 and concluded on 23 November 2013 in the same location.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=EUROPE/ITALY - Conclision of the diocesan phase of the beatification process of Luisa Guidotti Mistrali, missionary doctor, killed in Rhodesia|publisher=Fides|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=1 December 2017|url=http://www.fides.org/en/news/34774-EUROPE_ITALY_Conclusion_of_the_diocesan_phase_of_the_beatification_proces_of_Luisa_Guidotti_Mistrali_missionary_doctor_killed_in_Rhodesia#.WiD4OulJlYc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] priest Francesco Maria Ricci.

'''Mesomelia''' refers to conditions in which the middle parts of limbs are disproportionately short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mesomelia|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mesomelia|website=The American Heritage® Medical Dictionary|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When applied to [[Dwarfism|skeletal dysplasias]], '''mesomelic dwarfism''' describes generalised shortening of the forearms and lower legs. This is in contrast to [[rhizomelia|rhizomelic dwarfism]] in which the upper portions of limbs are short such as in [[achondroplasia]].

{{Bolivarian Missions}}
'''Mission Vuelta al Campo''' ("Return to the Countryside"; implementation announced in mid-2005) is one of the [[Bolivarian Missions]] (a series of anti-poverty and social welfare programs) implemented by former [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]]. Mission Vuelta al Campo seeks to encourage impoverished and unemployed urban Venezuelans to willingly return to the countryside.

Prior to the Chávez administration, Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth discoveries and extraction commenced in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85% (far higher than the average for both [[Latin America]] and the [[Third World]] and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer. The ''Ley de Tierras'' &amp;mdash; "Law of the Lands" &amp;mdash; was passed by presidential decree in November 2001; it included the creation of a ''[[Plan Zamora]]'' to implement [[land reform]]s, including [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]], in Venezuelan agriculture. Underutilized or unused private corporate and agricultural estates would now be subject to [[Nationalization|expropriation]] after fair-market compensation was paid to the owners. Inheritable, inalienable, and at times communal land grants were also made to small farmers and farmer's collectives. The rationale given for this program was that it would provide incentives for the eventual and gradual repopulation of the countryside and provide "[[food security]]" for the country by lessening the present dependence on foreign imports. There are three types of land that may be distributed under the program:
# government land,
# land that is claimed by private owners, but whose claims the government disputes,
# and underutilized private land.
To date, the Chávez government has only distributed the first two types of land.

Mission Vuelta al Campo fits into this context by seeking to facilitate the willing migration of urban residents back to the countryside in order to receive the benefits of these redistributions. The Chávez government desires that, with increased small-scale farming and ranching by formerly poor, mostly slum-dwelling Venezuelans, both increased economic opportunities of the poor as well as the [[food sovereignty]] of Venezuela may be secured.

The '''Multiple Sleep Latency Test''' ('''MSLT''') is a [[sleep disorder]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic tool]]. It is used to measure the time elapsed from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep, called '''[[sleep latency]]'''. The test is based on the idea that the sleepier people are, the faster they will fall asleep.

The MSLT is used extensively to test for [[narcolepsy]], to distinguish between physical tiredness and true [[excessive daytime sleepiness]], or to assess whether treatments for [[respiratory disease|breathing disorders]] are working. Its main purpose is to discover how readily a person will fall asleep in a conducive setting, how consistent or variable this is, and the way they fall asleep in terms of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]] and other brain patterns.  This can be used to identify and differentiate between various sleep problems.

The test consists of four or five 20-minute nap opportunities set two hours apart, often following an overnight sleep study. During the test, data such as the patient's [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]], [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], muscle activity, and [[eye movements]] are monitored and recorded. The entire test normally takes about 7 hours during the course of a day.

==History==
The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was created in 1977 by sleep pioneers [[William C. Dement]] and [[Mary Carskadon]].&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon, M.A.; Dement, W.C. Sleep tendency: an objective measure of sleep loss. Sleep Research 6: 200, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G.S.; Carskadon, M.A.; Flagg, W.; Van den Hoed, J.; Dement, W.C.; Mitler, M.M. Excessive daytime sleepiness in man: multiple sleep latency measurement in narcoleptic and control subjects. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol. 1978 Nov;45(5):621–627.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon, M.A.; Dement, W.C.; Mitler, M.M.; Roth, T.; Westbrook, P.R.; Keenan, S. Guidelines for the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT): a standard measure of sleepiness. Sleep 1986; 9:519–524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorpy, M.J.; Westbrook, P.; Ferber, R.; Fredrickson, P.; Mahowald, M.; Perez-Guerra, F.; Reite, M.; Smith, P. The clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Sleep 1992; 15:268–276.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed out of repeating a project done in 1970 by Dr. Dement called the 90-minute day.&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon, M.A.; Dement, W.C. Sleep studies on a 90-minute day. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 39: 145–155, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; They informally called the 0–5 minute range the ''twilight zone'' due to its indication of extreme physical and mental impairment.

==Typical procedure==
Preparation: On the day of the test the patient is asked not to consume any stimulants, such as tea, coffee, colas, and chocolate.
* Often a formal sleep study has been performed the night before.
* Sometimes [[urine screening]] is done to make sure no substances exist in the subject's body that might interfere with sleep.
* The patient may be asked to fill out a pre-test questionnaire. 
* [[Electrodes]] are attached to the patient's head to record brain waves.
* Electrodes are attached by the eyes to record eye movement.
* Electrodes are attached to the chin to detect muscle tone. 
* [[Pulse|Heart beat]] may also be monitored.
* The patient is asked to perform simple tasks to test that the equipment is working properly.
* The patient is asked to nap for 20 minutes, and then is awakened.
* The nap process is repeated every 2 hours for a total of four or five times.
* The patient may be asked to fill out a post-test questionnaire.
*A [[polysomnographic technologist|sleep technologist]] will gently place [[sensors]] on patient's head, face and chin. These sensors are connected to a computer. The sensors show when patient is asleep and awake, and transmit data used to determine when patient is in REM sleep. The nap trial begins when the lights are turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sleepeducation.com/disease-management/multiple-sleep-latency-test/testing-process-results |title=Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) - Testing Process &amp; Results|accessdate=8 September 2014|publisher=American Academy of Sleep Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[clinical neurophysiologist]], [[neurologist]] or [[sleep medicine|sleep specialist]] will review the results and inform the patient or the patient's [[primary care physician]] of the interpretation of the test result in the context of the clinical problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6713">[[File:Phenylketonuria testing.jpg|thumb|The blood of a two-week-old infant is collected for a [[Phenylketonuria]], or PKU, screening]]

The '''neonatal heel prick''' is a blood collection procedure done on newborns. It consists of making a pinprick puncture in one heel of the newborn to collect their blood.  This technique is used frequently as the main way to collect blood from neonates.  Other techniques include venous or arterial needle sticks, cord blood sampling, or umbilical line collection.  This technique is often utilized for the '''Guthrie test''', where it is used to soaking the blood into pre-printed collection cards known as Guthrie cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s867619.htm Guthrie Cards], ''[[Catalyst (TV program)|Catalyst]]'' ([[ABC1]]), 29 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McMillanFeigin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia A. McMillan|author2=Ralph D. Feigin|author3=Catherine DeAngelis|author4=M. Douglas Jones|title=Oski's pediatrics: principles &amp; practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbjFQiz8aR0C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=16 April 2010|date=1 April 2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-3894-1|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical Guthrie test is named after [[Robert Guthrie]], an American [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] and [[physician]] who devised it in 1962. The test has been widely used throughout North America and Europe as one of the core newborn screening tests since the late 1960s. The test was initially a [[bacterial inhibition assay]], but is gradually being replaced in many areas by newer techniques such as [[tandem mass spectrometry]] that can detect a wider variety of [[congenital disease]]s.

==Detected diseases==
The blood samples can be used for a variety of metabolic test to detect genetic conditions, including:
* [[Galactosemia]]
* [[Immunoreactive trypsinogen]] to detect [[cystic fibrosis]].
* [[Maple syrup urine disease]] (MSUD or Branched Chain Ketonuria) a rare disorder where an error in [[metabolism]] inhibits the breakdown of [[amino acid]] leucine, isoleucine and valine.  It can impair brain development.
* [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (MCADD)
* [[Phenylketonuria]], a disorder where an error in [[amino acid]] [[metabolism]] can impair brain development (PKU)
* [[Sickle-cell disease]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screening.nhs.uk/an/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212181713/http://www.screening.nhs.uk/an/index.htm |archivedate=2009-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) to detect [[congenital hypothyroidism]] and hence prevent [[cretinism]].

==Mechanism==
The test uses the growth of a strain of bacteria on a specially-prepared agar plate as a sign for the presence of high levels of phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate.  The compound B-2-thienylalanine will inhibit the growth of the bacterium ''Bacillus subtilis'' (ATCC 6051) on minimal culture media.  If phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate is added to the medium, then growth is restored.  Such compounds will be present in excess in the blood or urine of patients with PKU.  If a suitably-prepared sample of blood or urine is applied to the seeded agar plate, the growth of the bacteria in the test will be a positive indicator for PKU in the patient.&lt;ref name=uic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/classes/phar/phar332/Clinical_Cases/aa%20metab%20cases/PKU%20Cases/PHE-TST001.htm |title=PHE-TST001 |work=uic.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927101945/http://www.uic.edu/classes/phar/phar332/Clinical_Cases/aa%20metab%20cases/PKU%20Cases/PHE-TST001.htm |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare the sample for application, a small amount of blood (from a heel puncture, for example) or urine (from a diaper, for example) is applied to a piece of filter paper.  Then a small disc is punched from the center of the spot of blood or urine, and the disc applied to the surface of a seeded, minimal-medium agar plate that contains added beta-2-thienylalanine.  If the sample contains phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate then these compounds will diffuse into the agar medium.  If their concentrations are high enough (as with the excess levels seen with PKU), bacteria will grow under the disc, but not elsewhere.  Generally an overnight incubation is enough to determine whether phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate are present in unusual concentrations in blood or urine.&lt;ref name=uic /&gt;

==Timing==
The blood spot sample should be taken between 48 and 72 hours of age for
all babies regardless of medical condition, milk feeding
and prematurity.  For the purpose of screening, date
of birth is day 0 (some IT systems record date of birth
as day 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newbornbloodspot.screening.nhs.uk/standards|title=Standards|work=screening.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[False positive]]s and [[false negative]]s can sometimes occur when the screening tests are performed before 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/genetics/nbs.htm |title=Newborn screening guidelines |work=health.vic.gov.au (via archive.org) |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308182225/http://www.health.vic.gov.au/genetics/nbs.htm |archivedate=2006-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With genetic tests becoming more common, a wide variety of tests may use the blood drawn by this method. Many neonatal units (SCBUs) now use this method to carry out the daily blood tests (blood count, electrolytes) required to check the progress of ill neonates.

==Data retention controversy==
In Ireland, a controversy emerged in 2012 whereby a number of hospitals retained heel prick test cards and thereby a DNA database with over a million samples from 1984, without consent or notification of parents. This resulted in a ten-year rolling destruction cycle being introduced. Similar practices exist in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and several states of the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/international-standards-for-storing-samples-vary-wildly-1.474167|title=International standards for storing samples vary wildly|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organic feeding disorders''' are created when there are changes in an [[organism]] which directly or indirectly affect the organism's need to survive, or the need for [[nourishment]].  For example, when someone becomes ill, their body is naturally not as [[hunger|hungry]] as it was before.  This can also occur if a person's food intake is reduced; over time they will not want to eat as much and will reduce their efforts towards seeking out nourishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Overwork''' is the expression used to define the cause of  working too hard, too much, or too long. It can be also related to the act of working beyond one's strength or capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Overwork|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/overwork|access-date = 2015-05-09|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing physical and/or mental distress in the process.

Compulsory, mandatory, or forced [[overtime]] is usually defined as hours worked in excess of forty hours per week “that the employer makes compulsory with the threat of job loss or the threat of other reprisals such as demotion or assignment to unattractive tasks or work shifts."&lt;ref name="lung"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overwork and overtime|url = https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ilr/pdf/vol39p51.pdf|website = mckinneylaw.iu.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-26|ref = lung|last = Lung|first = Shirley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntary overwork ==
Voluntary overtime is work which the employer may ask the worker to do but which the worker is not required to work unless he agrees at the time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EAT decision concerning holiday pay and overtime|url = http://www.birketts.co.uk/resources/legal-updates/1564/eat-decision-concerning-holiday-pay-and-overtime/|website = www.birketts.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compulsory overwork ==
Compulsory overwork is that where the individual has no choice but to work more than their capacity. In other words, compulsory overwork is the lack of control that workers exercise over the boundary between work time and private time.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

== Consequences ==
Forced overtime, heavy workloads, and frenetic work paces give rise to debilitating repetitive stress injuries, on-the-job accidents, over-exposure to toxic substances, and other dangerous work conditions.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt; Nevertheless, some studies are beginning to show the costs of compulsory overwork. Reg Williams and Patricia Strasser, professors of nursing at the [[University of Michigan]], estimated in the journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses that the total cost of depression at work was as high as $44 billion. They pointed out that healthcare workers have focused much attention on the workplace risk factors for heart disease, cancer, [[obesity]], and other illnesses, but little emphasis on the risk factors for depression, stress, negative changes in personal life, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Take Back Your Time: Fighting Overwork and Time Poverty in America|url = https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dKziyTBAvzIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22compulsory+overwork%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wdlDcLIZUj&amp;sig=5HD4-8xdcFhAUeP8DyV-X2qcwAo&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rq9NVeP_GZKF8gXa5oGwBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compulsory%20overwork%22&amp;f=false|publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers|date = 2003-09-03|access-date = 2015-05-09|isbn = 9781609943974|language = en|first = John de|last = Graaf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual average work hours for Americans have risen from 1,679 in 1973 to 1,878 in 2000. This represents an increase of 199 hours—or approximately five additional weeks of work per year. This total work effort represents an average of nine weeks more than European workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Take Back Your Time: Fighting Overwork and Time Poverty in America|url = http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/colleges/hclas/cld/cld_rlr_f04_takeback.pdf|website = www.hofstra.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-09|last = de Graaf|first = John|publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is within this logic of working more to gain more that workers are living a very hectic and tiring time to provide their families. The result in reality is an excess that does not often translate into high salaries. There are categories of workers where the work and the environments are unhealthy turning the most vulnerable workers and sentenced to fatigue and even living less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress at Work - A report prepared for The Work Foundation’s Principal Partners|url = http://www.theworkfoundation.com/downloadpublication/report/69_69_stress_at_work.pdf|website = www.theworkfoundation.com|accessdate = 2015-06-08|last = Blaug|first = Ricardo|last2 = Kenyon|first2 = Amy|last3 = Lekhi|first3 = Rohit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional effects ===

The emotional impacts of overwork can vary, depending on the amount of work, levels of pressure and competition in the work space. Employees who worry about not getting work finished and keeping up a fast pace can feel like they are drowning in their workload, a feeling that manifests itself in [[chronic stress]] and [[anxiety]], which can hebetate the spirit and create tension in personal and work relationships. The behavior continues even if the worker becomes aware that it is personally harmful — even harmful to the quality of the work. The stress that goes along with working too much has been shown to lead to [[substance abuse]], [[sleep disorder]]s, anxiety and ultimately to physical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/09/22/cb.overworked.vs.challenged/|title=Overworked or challenged at your job? - CNN.com|first=By Kaitlin Madden,|last=CareerBuilder.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical effects ===

One of the key indicators that an individual is being overworked, and not merely challenged, is if work-related stress begins to take a toll on their physical health and general lifestyle. It is easy to distinguish different types of physical symptoms, such as getting sick frequently due to a weakened [[immune system]], depression and [[insomnia]]. All these symptoms can cause more fatigue-related errors at work and affect their personal lives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overworked or challenged at your job? - CNN.com|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/09/22/cb.overworked.vs.challenged/|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mayo Clinic]], other physical symptoms may include headache, neck pain, lower back pain, depression, changes to appetite and chronic fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==By country==
=== United States ===
Compulsory overtime and overwork present a growing "convergence" between workers regardless of their occupation, income, education, race, gender, or citizenship. For example, in the United States, immigrants and other low-wage workers toil excessive hours in traditional [[sweatshops]], such as garment factories, restaurants and other industry sectors. At the same time, exposés of "white-collar" and "electronic" sweatshops debunk the glamour of high-tech employment revealing large numbers of higher-paid skilled workers who work upwards of seventy to ninety hours a week under increasingly autocratic conditions.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

With the steep rise in annual work hours for individuals and families, more than half of American workers report feeling overworked, overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do, and/or lacking in time to reflect upon the work they are doing. Overwork is attributable to several trends. First, the climb in annual family work hours since 1979 has coincided with an era of stagnant and falling wages. Annual family work hours have swelled primarily because unprecedented numbers of women have entered the full-time workforce, and those who were already in the workforce have taken on increased hours of work to boost family incomes. Without the increased work hours of women, lower-and middle-income families would have seen their incomes fall or at best remain stagnant. African American and Latino families, whose average hours of work grew faster than white families throughout the 1980s and 1990s, would have been especially hard hit.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

Many immigrant workers are faced with the stark choice of complying with required overtime, increased workloads, and frenetic work paces, or being fired. Workers are pressured to compete with one another for longer hours to keep their jobs and avoid being replaced by workers who are more compliant with employer demands. [[Undocumented immigrant]] workers are particularly susceptible to demands for excessive hours. The threat of deportation, along with the criminalization of their work status, creates a climate of vulnerability that unscrupulous employers use to cheapen labor and extract more work.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

=== Japan ===
The problem of overwork in Japan has become so acute that the term ''[[karōshi]]'', literally means ‘death by overwork’ was coined a few years ago. The government estimates that 200 people die from ''karōshi'' every year because of heart attacks or [[cerebral hemorrhage]]s due to long hours spent at the work place. However, ''karōshi'' does not include deaths from mental depression or suicides. If this was the case, the number of work related deaths would dramatically increase. Data compiled by the Japanese government shows that 22 percent of the public work more than 49 hours a week, compared to 11 percent of French and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘Death by overwork’: Workaholic Japanese to be forced to take vacation time|url = http://rt.com/news/229943-japan-work-holiday-compulsory/|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers typically used less than half of their leave allowance in a year, according to a survey by the labour ministry which found that in 2013 employees took only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement. A separate poll showed that one in every six workers took no paid holidays at all in 2013. In early discussions, employer groups proposed limiting the number of compulsory paid holidays to three days, while unions called for eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan court orders $580k damages for overwork suicide|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-05/japan-worker-family-awarded-damages-for-overwork-suicide/5869926|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Japanese government finally decided to do something about the endemic culture of overwork, which has been blamed not just on a growing number of deaths, but also the country's critically low [[birth rate]] and declining productivity. Although Japan is notorious for hard work, it's equally known for inefficiency and bureaucracy. Workers sit around in the name of [[team spirit]], despite questionable performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan is literally working itself to death|url = http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/the-country-working-itself-to-death/story-fnkgbb6w-1227252245840|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxygen toxicity''' is a condition resulting from the harmful effects of breathing molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) at increased [[partial pressure]]s. It is also known as '''oxygen toxicity syndrome''', '''oxygen intoxication''', and '''oxygen poisoning'''.  Severe cases can result in [[cell (biology)|cell]] damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, [[lung]]s, and eyes.  Historically, the [[central nervous system]] condition was called the ''[[Paul Bert]] effect'', and the [[pulmonary]] condition the ''[[James Lorrain Smith|Lorrain Smith]] effect'', after the researchers who pioneered the discoveries and descriptions in the late 19th century.  Oxygen toxicity is a concern for [[Underwater diving|underwater divers]], those on high [[concentration]]s of supplemental oxygen (particularly [[preterm birth|premature]] babies), and those undergoing [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]].

The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is [[hyperoxia]], an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as [[myopia]]. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause [[oxidative damage]] to [[cell membranes]], collapse of the [[alveoli]] in the lungs, [[retinal detachment]], and [[seizures]]. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.

[[Medical guideline|Protocols]] for avoidance of the effects of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including [[underwater diving]] using compressed [[breathing gases]], hyperbaric medicine, [[neonatal care]] and [[human spaceflight]]. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.

In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in [[oxygen bar]]s. The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific training in using such gases.

== Classification ==

[[File:Clark1974.png|center|700px|alt=The effects of high inspired oxygen pressure: (1) chemical toxicity, pulmonary damage, hypoxemia; (2) retinal damage, erythrocyte hemolysis, liver damage, heart damage, endocrine effects, kidney damage, destruction of any cell; (3) toxic effects on central nervous system, twitching, convulsions, death.|Breathing air with high oxygen pressure can lead to several adverse effects.]]

The effects of oxygen toxicity may be classified by the organs affected, producing three principal forms:{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=358–360}}&lt;ref name="Acott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14232720" /&gt;

* Central nervous system, characterised by [[seizure|convulsions]] followed by unconsciousness, occurring under hyperbaric conditions;
* Pulmonary (lungs), characterised by difficulty in breathing and pain within the chest, occurring when breathing increased pressures of oxygen for extended periods;
* Ocular ([[retinopathy|retinopathic conditions]]), characterised by alterations to the eyes, occurring when breathing increased pressures of oxygen for extended periods.

Central nervous system oxygen toxicity can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and is of concern to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the [[retina]]. Pulmonary and ocular damage are most likely to occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Oxidative damage may occur in any cell in the body but the effects on the three most susceptible organs will be the primary concern. It may also be implicated in damage to red blood cells ([[haemolysis]]),&lt;ref name="pmid5782651" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4403030" /&gt;  the [[liver]],&lt;ref name="pmid5885427" /&gt; [[Cardiac muscle|heart]],&lt;ref name="pmid5046798" /&gt; [[endocrine system|endocrine]] glands ([[adrenal gland]]s, [[gonad]]s, and [[thyroid]]),&lt;ref name="pmid13228600" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13889254" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gersh" /&gt; or [[kidney]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid5155150" /&gt; and general damage to [[cell (biology)|cells]].{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=358–360}}&lt;ref name="pmid4613232" /&gt;

In unusual circumstances, effects on other tissues may be observed: it is suspected that during spaceflight, high oxygen concentrations may contribute to bone damage.&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt; Hyperoxia can also indirectly cause [[CO2 retention|carbon dioxide narcosis]] in patients with lung ailments such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or with central respiratory depression.&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt;  [[Hyperventilation]] of atmospheric air at atmospheric pressures does not cause oxygen toxicity, because sea-level air has a partial pressure of oxygen of {{convert|0.21|bar|abbr=on}} whereas toxicity does not occur below {{convert|0.3|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|p=159}}

=== Central nervous system ===

[[Central nervous system]] oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes (especially [[tunnel vision]]), ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]), [[nausea]], twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, [[anxiety]], confusion), and [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]]. This may be followed by a [[tonic–clonic seizure]] consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking ([[clonus|clonic]] phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the [[postictal state]]).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=376}}{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the [[breathing gas]] and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day.{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=376}}{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=22|loc=vol. 4, ch. 18}}&lt;ref name="Bitterman" /&gt; In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms.{{sfn|Donald, Part I|1947}} Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of [[carbon dioxide]].{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=82}}&lt;ref name="rebreather2.0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="padi" /&gt; Other factors, such as darkness and [[caffeine]], increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid3705247" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8574677" /&gt;

=== Lungs ===

Pulmonary toxicity symptoms result from an inflammation that starts in the airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs ([[tracheobronchial tree]]). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region ([[Human sternum|substernal]] and [[Carina of trachea|carinal]] regions).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}}&lt;ref name="pmid4948324" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4929472" /&gt; This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing.{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}} If breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath ([[dyspnea|dyspnoea]]).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}} Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a [[stethoscope]] (bubbling [[rales]]), fever, and increased blood flow to the lining of the nose ([[hyperaemia]] of the nasal [[mucosa]]).&lt;ref name="pmid4929472" /&gt; X-rays of the lungs show little change in the short term, but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs.{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}} [[Spirometry|Pulmonary function measurements]] are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold ([[vital capacity]]) and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity.&lt;ref name="pmid4929472" /&gt;{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=386–387}} Tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species. When the exposure to oxygen above {{convert|0.5|bar|abbr=on}} is intermittent, it permits the lungs to recover and delays the onset of toxicity.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=== Eyes ===

In premature babies, signs of damage to the eye ([[retinopathy of prematurity]], or ROP) are observed via an [[ophthalmoscope]] as a demarcation between the [[wikt:vascularize|vascularised]] and non-vascularised regions of an infant's retina. The degree of this demarcation is used to designate four stages: (I) the demarcation is a line; (II) the demarcation becomes a ridge; (III) growth of new blood vessels occurs around the ridge; (IV) the retina begins to detach from the inner wall of the eye ([[choroid]]).&lt;ref name="Best" /&gt;

== Causes ==

Oxygen toxicity is caused by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and the provision of supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the [[risk factors]] are markedly different.

=== Central nervous system toxicity ===

{{see also|Technical diving}}

Exposures, from minutes to a few hours, to partial pressures of oxygen above {{convert|1.6|bar|lk=on}}—about eight times normal atmospheric partial pressure—are usually associated with central nervous system oxygen toxicity and are most likely to occur among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and divers. Since sea level atmospheric pressure is about {{convert|1|bar|abbr=on}}, central nervous system toxicity can only occur under [[hyperbaric]] conditions, where [[ambient pressure]] is above normal.&lt;ref name="smerz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hampson215-9" /&gt; Divers breathing air at depths beyond {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} face an increasing risk of an oxygen toxicity "hit" (seizure). Divers breathing a gas mixture enriched with oxygen, such as [[nitrox]], can similarly suffer a seizure at shallower depths, should they descend below the [[maximum operating depth]] allowed for the mixture.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=7}}

=== Lung toxicity ===
[[File:Pulmonary toxicity tolerance curves.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|alt=Pulmonary toxicity tolerance curves. Refer to caption.|The curves show typical decrement in lung vital capacity when breathing oxygen. Lambertsen concluded in 1987 that 0.5 bar could be tolerated indefinitely.]]
The lungs and the remainder of the [[respiratory tract]] are exposed to the highest concentration of oxygen in the human body and are therefore the first organs to show toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity occurs only with exposure to partial pressures of oxygen greater than {{convert|0.5|bar|abbr=on}}, corresponding to an oxygen fraction of 50% at normal atmospheric pressure.  The earliest signs of pulmonary toxicity begin with evidence of tracheobronchitis, or inflammation of the upper airways, after an asymptomatic period between 4 and 22 hours at greater than 95% oxygen,&lt;ref name="Bitterman2009" /&gt; with some studies suggesting symptoms usually begin after approximately 14 hours at this level of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

At partial pressures of oxygen of {{convert|2|to|3|bar|abbr=on}}—100% oxygen at 2 to 3 times atmospheric pressure—these symptoms may begin as early as 3 hours after exposure to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bitterman2009" /&gt; Experiments on rats breathing oxygen at pressures between {{convert|1|and|3|bar}} suggest that pulmonary manifestations of oxygen toxicity may not be the same for [[:wikt:normobaric|normobaric]] conditions as they are for [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric]] conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid17416738" /&gt; Evidence of decline in lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing can occur as quickly as 24 hours of continuous exposure to 100% oxygen,&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; with evidence of [[diffuse alveolar damage]] and the onset of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] usually occurring after 48 hours on 100% oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bitterman2009" /&gt; Breathing 100% oxygen also eventually leads to collapse of the [[alveoli]] ([[atelectasis]]), while—at the same partial pressure of oxygen—the presence of significant partial pressures of inert gases, typically nitrogen, will prevent this effect.&lt;ref name="Wittner" /&gt;

Preterm newborns are known to be at higher risk for [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bancalari" /&gt; Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on [[mechanical ventilation]] with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent [[bleomycin]].&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in [[intensive care]] recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%.&lt;ref name="Bitterman2009" /&gt; Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of [[decompression sickness]] are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.&lt;ref name="smerz" /&gt;

=== Eye toxicity ===
{{see also|Retinopathy of prematurity}}

Prolonged exposure to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes damage to the [[retina]].&lt;ref name="NEDU47" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid754368" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1701697" /&gt; Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid9603802" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants.&lt;ref name="pmid9603802" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt; In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs when the development of the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is [[Granulation tissue|fibrous tissue]] (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a [[risk factor]], is '''not''' the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.&lt;ref name="pmid9603802" /&gt;

Hyperoxic [[myopia]] has occurred in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shykoff3492" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18500077" /&gt; It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy.&lt;ref name="pmid754368" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myopialength" /&gt; This is due to an increase in the refractive power of the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], since axial length and [[Keratometer|keratometry]] readings do not reveal a [[cornea]]l or length basis for a myopic shift.&lt;ref name="myopialength" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16358652" /&gt; It is usually reversible with time.&lt;ref name="pmid754368" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myopialength" /&gt;

== Mechanism ==

{{main|Reactive oxygen species|Oxidative stress}}
[[File:Lipid peroxidation.svg|thumb|300px|The lipid peroxidation mechanism shows a single radical initiating a chain reaction which converts unsaturated lipids to lipid peroxides, |alt=An unsaturated lipid reacts with a hydroxyl radical to form a lipid radical (initiation), which then reacts with di-oxygen, forming a lipid peroxyl radical. This then reacts with another unsaturated lipid, yielding a lipid peroxide and another lipid radical, which can continue the reaction (propagation).]]

The biochemical basis for the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species,{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=360}} which are natural by-products of the normal [[metabolism]] of oxygen and have important roles in [[cell signalling]].&lt;ref name="pmid16809515" /&gt; One species produced by the body, the [[superoxide]] anion ({{chem|O|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name="pmid1316738" /&gt; is possibly involved in iron acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid12791678" /&gt; Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name="Fridovich" /&gt; Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to all parts of the body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="Bitterman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18549826" /&gt;

While all the reaction mechanisms of these species within the body are not yet fully understood,&lt;ref name="Imlay2003" /&gt; one of the most reactive products of oxidative stress is the [[hydroxyl radical]] ('''·'''OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of [[lipid peroxidation]] in the unsaturated [[lipids]] within [[cell membranes]].&lt;ref name="Bowen" /&gt; High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other [[free radical]]s, such as [[nitric oxide]], [[peroxynitrite]], and [[trioxidane]], which harm [[DNA]] and other biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Bitterman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1329105" /&gt; Although the body has many [[antioxidant]] systems such as [[glutathione]] that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it.&lt;ref name="pmid2825395" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10372426" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15485085" /&gt; Cell damage and cell death then result.&lt;ref name="pmid1886163" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of central nervous system oxygen toxicity in divers prior to seizure is difficult as the symptoms of visual disturbance, ear problems, dizziness, confusion and nausea can be due to many factors common to the underwater environment such as [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcosis]], congestion and coldness. However, these symptoms may be helpful in diagnosing the first stages of oxygen toxicity in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In either case, unless there is a prior history of [[epilepsy]] or tests indicate [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycaemia]], a seizure occurring in the setting of breathing oxygen at partial pressures greater than {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}} suggests a diagnosis of oxygen toxicity.&lt;ref name="NBDHMT" /&gt;

Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn infants with breathing difficulties is difficult in the first few weeks. However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, [[blood tests]] and [[x-rays]] may be used to confirm bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, an [[echocardiogram]] can help to eliminate other possible causes such as [[congenital heart defects]] or [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]].&lt;ref name="nih bpd_Diagnosis" /&gt;

The diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, low birth weight and a history of oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=178}}

== Prevention ==

[[File:Cylinder mod.jpg|thumb|The label on the diving cylinder shows that it contains oxygen-rich gas (36%) and is boldly marked with a maximum operating depth of 28&amp;nbsp;metres. |alt=Closeup of a diving cylinder with a band reading "NITROX". A hand-printed label at the neck reads "MOD 28m 36% O2", with the 28 in much larger size.]]

The prevention of oxygen toxicity depends entirely on the setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity must be carried out without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.

=== Underwater ===

{{see also|Maximum operating depth}}

Oxygen toxicity is a catastrophic hazard in [[Underwater diving|diving]], because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=7}} The seizure may occur suddenly and with no warning symptoms.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their [[Diving regulator|regulator]] and drown.&lt;ref name="pmid23342767"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Simon Mitchell|Mitchell, Simon J]]; Bennett, Michael H; Bird, Nick; Doolette, David J; [[Gene Hobbs|Hobbs, Gene W]]; Kay, Edward; Moon, Richard E; Neuman, Tom S; Vann, Richard D; Walker, Richard; Wyatt, HA |title=Recommendations for rescue of a submerged unresponsive compressed-gas diver |journal=Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1099–108 |year=2012 |pmid=23342767 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10161 |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=375}} One of the advantages of a [[full-face diving mask]] is prevention of regulator loss in the event of a seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a [[maximum operating depth]] for oxygen-rich [[breathing gas]]es, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.&lt;ref name="padi" /&gt;{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}}

In some [[diver training]] courses for these types of diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor what is called the ''oxygen clock'' of their dives.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased oxygen pressure and is set to activate at the maximum single exposure limit recommended in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] Diving Manual.&lt;ref name="padi" /&gt;{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limits are: 45 minutes at {{convert|1.6|bar|abbr=on}}, 120 minutes at {{convert|1.5|bar|abbr=on}}, 150 minutes at {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}, 180 minutes at {{convert|1.3|bar|abbr=on}} and 210 minutes at {{convert|1.2|bar|abbr=on}}, but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur.&lt;ref name="Butler3727183" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler15233156" /&gt; Many [[nitrox]]-capable [[dive computer]]s calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas or by reducing the time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases with the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the duration of exposure to oxygen-rich gases.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|pp=157–162}}&lt;ref name="Baker2000" /&gt;

Diving below {{convert|56|m|ft|abbr=on}} on air would expose a diver to increasing danger of oxygen toxicity as the partial pressure of oxygen exceeds {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}, so a gas mixture must be used which contains less than 21% oxygen (a hypoxic mixture). Increasing the proportion of [[nitrogen]] is not viable, since it would produce a strongly [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcotic]] mixture. However, [[helium]] is not narcotic, and a usable mixture may be [[Gas blending|blended]] either by completely replacing nitrogen with helium (the resulting mix is called [[heliox]]), or by replacing part of the nitrogen with helium, producing a [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]].{{sfn|Hamilton|Thalmann|2003|p=475,479}}

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is an entirely avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|p=270}} Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they are at risk of pulmonary toxicity.&lt;ref name="repex1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="repex2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spums" /&gt;

=== Hyperbaric setting ===

The presence of a fever or a history of seizure is a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatment.&lt;ref name="Latham2008" /&gt; The schedules used for treatment of [[decompression illness]] allow for periods of breathing air rather than 100% oxygen (oxygen breaks) to reduce the chance of seizure or lung damage. The U.S. Navy uses treatment tables based on periods alternating between 100% oxygen and air. For example, USN table 6 requires 75&amp;nbsp;minutes (three periods of 20&amp;nbsp;minutes oxygen/5&amp;nbsp;minutes air) at an ambient pressure of {{convert|2.8|atm|lk=in}}, equivalent to a depth of {{convert|18|m|ft|sigfig=1}}. This is followed by a slow reduction in pressure to {{convert|1.9|atm|abbr=on}} over 30&amp;nbsp;minutes on oxygen. The patient then remains at that pressure for a further 150&amp;nbsp;minutes, consisting of two periods of 15&amp;nbsp;minutes air/60&amp;nbsp;minutes oxygen, before the pressure is reduced to atmospheric over 30&amp;nbsp;minutes on oxygen.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=41|loc=vol. 5, ch. 20}}

[[Vitamin E]] and [[selenium]] were proposed and later rejected as a potential method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity.&lt;ref name="Schatte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1852722" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GUEdvd" /&gt; There is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin E and selenium aid in preventing ''[[in vivo]]'' [[lipid peroxidation]] and free radical damage, and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive hyperbaric oxygen exposures.&lt;ref name="pmid2744583" /&gt;

=== Normobaric setting ===

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is reversible in the early stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt;

Retinopathy of prematurity is largely preventable by screening. Current guidelines require that all babies of less than 32&amp;nbsp;weeks [[gestational age]] or having a birth weight less than {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity at least every two weeks.&lt;ref name="rcpch" /&gt; The ''National Cooperative Study'' in 1954 showed a causal link between supplemental oxygen and retinopathy of prematurity, but subsequent curtailment of supplemental oxygen caused an increase in infant mortality. To balance the risks of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and retinopathy of prematurity, modern protocols now require monitoring of blood oxygen levels in premature infants receiving oxygen.&lt;ref name="Silverman" /&gt;

=== Hypobaric setting ===

In low-pressure environments oxygen toxicity may be avoided since the toxicity is caused by high partial pressure of oxygen, not merely by high oxygen fraction. This is illustrated by modern pure oxygen use in spacesuits, which must operate at low pressure (also historically, very high percentage oxygen and lower than normal atmospheric pressure was used in early spacecraft, for example, the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo spacecraft]]).&lt;ref name="pmid2730484" /&gt; In such applications as [[extra-vehicular activity]], high-fraction oxygen is non-toxic, even at breathing mixture fractions approaching 100%, because the oxygen partial pressure is not allowed to [[Chronic toxicity|chronically]] exceed {{convert|0.3|bar|psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="pmid2730484" /&gt;

== Management ==

[[File:Human eye cross section detached retina.svg|thumb|alt=Diagram of an eye, in cross-section. |The retina (red) is detached at the top of the eye.]]
[[File:Human eye cross section scleral buckle.svg|thumb|alt=Diagram of an eye with a scleral buckle, in cross-section. |The silicone band ([[scleral buckle]], blue) is placed around the eye. This brings the wall of the eye into contact with the detached retina, allowing the retina to re-attach.]]

During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the patient will usually breathe 100% oxygen from a mask while inside a hyperbaric chamber pressurised with air to about {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}}. Seizures during the therapy are managed by removing the mask from the patient, thereby dropping the partial pressure of oxygen inspired below {{convert|0.6|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}}

A seizure underwater requires that the diver be brought to the surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of [[arterial gas embolism]] (AGE),{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|p=45|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} there is some evidence that the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway.&lt;ref name="RBW2008" /&gt; This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth&amp;nbsp;– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE&amp;nbsp;– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012" /&gt; Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a [[controlled buoyant lift]]. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most [[diver training]] agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention.&lt;ref name="DANoxtox" /&gt; The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2011|pp=37–39|loc=vol. 2, ch. 9}}

The occurrence of symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or acute respiratory distress syndrome  is treated by lowering the fraction of oxygen administered, along with a reduction in the periods of exposure and an increase in the break periods where normal air is supplied. Where supplemental oxygen is required for treatment of another disease (particularly in infants), a [[ventilator]] may be needed to ensure that the lung tissue remains inflated. Reductions in pressure and exposure will be made progressively, and medications such as [[bronchodilators]] and [[pulmonary surfactant]]s may be used.&lt;ref name="MPBPD" /&gt;

Retinopathy of prematurity may [[Regression (medicine)|regress]] spontaneously, but should the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of [[Retinopathy of prematurity#International classification of retinopathy of prematurity .28ICROP.29|stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity]]), both [[cryosurgery]] and [[laser surgery]] have been shown to reduce the risk of blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as [[Scleral buckle|scleral buckling]] and [[vitrectomy]] surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=184}}

== Prognosis ==

Although the convulsions caused by central nervous system oxygen toxicity may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.&lt;ref name="Bitterman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FennRahn" /&gt;

The majority of infants who have survived following an incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia  will eventually recover near-normal lung function, since lungs continue to grow during the first 5–7 years and the damage caused by bronchopulmonary dysplasia is to some extent reversible (even in adults). However, they are likely to be more susceptible to respiratory infections for the rest of their lives and the severity of later infections is often greater than that in their peers.&lt;ref name="nih bpd_WhatIs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth" /&gt;

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where the disease has progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good for the treatment of stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=190}}

== Epidemiology ==
&lt;!-- Before you change "6" to "six". please read [[MOS:SYL#Numbers as figures or words]], in particular the exception for comparable quantities --&gt;
[[File:Incidence of ROP.svg|thumb|400px |alt=Percentage of severe visual impairment and blindness due to ROP in children in Schools for the Blind in different regions of the world: Europe 6–17%; Latin America 4.1–38.6%; Eastern Europe 25.9%; Asia 16.9%; Africa 10.6%. |Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in 1997 was more common in middle income countries where neonatal intensive care services were increasing; but greater awareness of the problem, leading to preventive measures, had not yet occurred.&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt;]]

The incidence of central nervous system toxicity among divers has decreased since the Second World War, as protocols have developed to limit exposure and partial pressure of oxygen inspired. In 1947, Donald recommended limiting the depth allowed for breathing pure oxygen to {{convert|7.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which equates to an oxygen partial pressure of {{convert|1.8|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Donald, Part II|1947}} Over time this limit has been reduced, until today a limit of {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}} during a recreational dive and {{convert|1.6|bar|abbr=on}} during shallow decompression stops is generally recommended.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=183}} Oxygen toxicity has now become a rare occurrence other than when caused by equipment malfunction and human error. Historically, the U.S. Navy has refined its Navy Diving Manual Tables to reduce oxygen toxicity incidents. Between 1995 and 1999, reports showed 405 surface-supported dives using the helium–oxygen tables; of these, oxygen toxicity symptoms were observed on 6 dives (1.5%). As a result, the U.S. Navy in 2000 modified the schedules and conducted field tests of 150 dives, none of which produced symptoms of oxygen toxicity. Revised tables were published in 2001.&lt;ref name="Gerth" /&gt;

The variability in tolerance and other variable factors such as workload have resulted in the U.S. Navy abandoning screening for oxygen tolerance. Of the 6,250 oxygen-tolerance tests performed between 1976 and 1997, only 6 episodes of oxygen toxicity were observed (0.1%).&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3705251" /&gt;

Central nervous system oxygen toxicity among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy is rare, and is influenced by a number of a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably [[Indication (medicine)|therapy indication]] and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%.&lt;ref name="pmid15485078" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12964858" /&gt; Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%.&lt;ref name="pmid15485078" /&gt; A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.&lt;ref name="pmid15559001" /&gt;

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is among the most common complications of [[Premature birth|prematurely born]] infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.&lt;ref name="Bancalari" /&gt;

In 1997 a summary of studies of neonatal intensive care units in industrialised countries showed that up to 60% of [[low birth weight]] babies developed retinopathy of prematurity, which rose to 72% in extremely low birth weight babies, defined as less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth. However, severe outcomes are much less frequent: for very low birth weight babies—those less than {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth—the incidence of blindness was found to be no more than 8%.&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Paul Bert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Paul Bert, a French physiologist, first described oxygen toxicity in 1878. |alt=Photograph of a man, with receding hairline and grey moustache. He is dressed in a formal jacket and waistcoat, typical of Victorian fashion.]]

Central nervous system toxicity was first described by [[Paul Bert]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Bert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BSAC" /&gt; He showed that oxygen was toxic to insects, [[arachnids]], [[Myriapoda|myriapods]], molluscs, earthworms, fungi, germinating seeds, birds, and other animals. Central nervous system toxicity may be referred to as the "Paul Bert effect".&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt;

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity was first described by J. Lorrain Smith in 1899 when he noted central nervous system toxicity and discovered in experiments in mice and birds that {{convert|0.43|bar|abbr=on}} had no effect but {{convert|0.75|bar|abbr=on}} of oxygen was a pulmonary irritant.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Pulmonary toxicity may be referred to as the "Lorrain Smith effect".&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt; The first recorded human exposure was undertaken in 1910 by Bornstein when two men breathed oxygen at {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}} for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes while he went on to 48&amp;nbsp;minutes with no symptoms. In 1912, Bornstein developed cramps in his hands and legs while breathing oxygen at {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}} for 51&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="Acott" /&gt; Smith then went on to show that intermittent exposure to a breathing gas with less oxygen permitted the lungs to recover and delayed the onset of pulmonary toxicity.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

[[Albert R. Behnke]] ''et al.'' in 1935 were the first to observe [[visual field]] contraction ([[tunnel vision]]) on dives between {{convert|1.0|bar|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.1|bar|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Behnke Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behnke Forbes" /&gt; During World War II, Donald and Yarbrough ''et al.'' performed over 2,000 experiments on oxygen toxicity to support the initial use of closed circuit oxygen [[rebreather]]s.&lt;ref name="NEDU47" /&gt;{{sfn|Donald|1992}} Naval divers in the early years of [[oxygen rebreather]] diving developed a mythology about a monster called "Oxygen Pete", who lurked in the bottom of the Admiralty Experimental Diving Unit "wet pot" (a water-filled [[hyperbaric chamber]]) to catch unwary divers. They called having an oxygen toxicity attack "getting a Pete".&lt;ref name="pete" /&gt;&lt;ref name="davis1955" /&gt;

In the decade following World War II, [[Christian J. Lambertsen|Lambertsen]] ''et al.'' made further discoveries on the effects of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention.&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vann 2004" /&gt; Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of [[standard operating procedure]]s when breathing increased pressures of oxygen.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970}} Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure [[guidelines]] to future [[Scuba set|breathing apparatus]] design.&lt;ref name="rebreather2.0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="padi" /&gt;{{sfn|Lang|2001|pp=81–6}}

Retinopathy of prematurity was not observed before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly became one of the principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt;

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was first described by Northway in 1967, who outlined the conditions that would lead to the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid5334613" /&gt; This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36&amp;nbsp;weeks could predict long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name="pmid3174313" /&gt; Nevertheless, Palta ''et al.'' in 1998 concluded that [[radiographic]] evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.&lt;ref name="pmid9470001" /&gt;

Bitterman ''et al.'' in 1986 and 1995 showed that [[Lighting|darkness]] and [[caffeine]] would delay the onset of changes to [[electroencephalography|brain electrical activity]] in rats.&lt;ref name="pmid3705247" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8574677" /&gt; In the years since, research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance.&lt;ref name="natoliMS" /&gt; Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity has been shown to be affected by factors such as [[circadian rhythm]], drugs, age, and gender.&lt;ref name="pmid5130131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15622741" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5061633" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17672171" /&gt; In 1988, Hamilton ''et al.'' wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for [[Underwater habitat|habitat]] operations.&lt;ref name="repex1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="repex2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spums" /&gt; Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Shykoff2007" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

{{see also|Nitrox|Oxygen bar}}

[[Recreational diving|Recreational scuba divers]] commonly breathe [[nitrox]] containing up to 40% oxygen, while [[Technical diving|technical divers]] use pure oxygen or nitrox containing up to 80% oxygen. Divers who breathe oxygen fractions greater than of air (21%) need to be trained in the dangers of oxygen toxicity and how to prevent them.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} In order to buy nitrox, a diver has to show evidence of such qualification.&lt;ref name="BSACnitrox" /&gt;

Since the late 1990s the recreational use of oxygen has been promoted by oxygen bars, where customers breathe oxygen through a [[nasal cannula]]. Claims have been made that this reduces stress, increases energy, and lessens the effects of hangovers and headaches, despite the lack of any scientific evidence to support them.&lt;ref name="Bren" /&gt; There are also devices on sale that offer "oxygen massage" and "oxygen detoxification" with claims of removing body toxins and reducing body fat.&lt;ref name="o2planet" /&gt; The [[American Lung Association]] has stated "there is no evidence that oxygen at the low flow levels used in bars can be dangerous to a normal person's health", but the U.S. [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] cautions that people with heart or lung disease need their supplementary oxygen carefully regulated and should not use oxygen bars.&lt;ref name="Bren" /&gt;

Victorian society had a fascination for the rapidly expanding field of science. In "[[Dr. Ox's Experiment]]", a short story written by [[Jules Verne]] in 1872, the eponymous doctor uses [[electrolysis of water]] to separate oxygen and hydrogen. He then pumps the pure oxygen throughout the town of Quiquendone, causing the normally tranquil inhabitants and their animals to become aggressive and plants to grow rapidly. An explosion of the hydrogen and oxygen in Dr Ox's factory brings his experiment to an end. Verne summarised his story by explaining that the effects of oxygen described in the tale were his own invention.&lt;ref name="Verne Dr Ox" /&gt; There is also a brief episode of oxygen intoxication in his "[[From the Earth to the Moon]]".&lt;ref name="Verne 1877" /&gt;

'''''P.P v. Health Service Executive''''' was a 2014 case in the [[High Court (Ireland)|Irish High Court]] to rule on whether a [[pregnant]] woman (anonymised as "N.P.") who was [[brain dead]] ought to be kept on [[life support]] until the [[foetus]] was [[Fetal viability|viable]] and could be [[Childbirth|delivered]]. The woman's [[next of kin]] wished her life support to be switched off but medical staff were unsure whether this would violate the [[fetal rights|foetus' right]] to life, which is guaranteed by the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]]. The case was brought against the [[Health Service Executive]] (HSE) by N.P.'s father "P.P."

==Timeline==
On 27 November 2014, a woman, twelve to fourteen weeks pregnant, was admitted to hospital with headaches and nausea. Two days later, she suffered a fall and was later found to be unresponsive. On 3 December, she was declared clinically brain dead.&lt;ref name="nyt271214"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/world/europe/ireland-court-rules-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-may-be-taken-off-life-support.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Irish Court Lets Woman Be Taken Off Life Support|date=27 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|first=Douglas|last=Dalby|page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was a large [[cerebellar]] [[cyst]]ic lesion causing [[obstructive hydrocephalus|acute hydrocephalus]] and compression of [[brain stem]]. She was placed on life support against her family's wishes. Her parents and partner supported turning off the life support machines. Her two young children did not recognise her when they visited her, and were upset at her appearance.

On 15 December 2014, her father applied to the High Court for life support to be turned off. [[Nicholas Kearns]], the [[President of the High Court]], fast-tracked P.P.'s application for his daughter to be made his [[Ward (law)|ward]], which took effect on 23 December. On 22 December Kearns decided that the case was important enough for three judges to hear it: himself, Marie Baker, and Caroline Costello. 

The case was heard on 24 December. Four [[senior counsel]] were heard: Mary O'Toole for the plaintiff, Gerry Durcan for the respondent, Cormac Corrigan representing the interests of the woman, and Conor Dignam representing the interests of the unborn child. Seven doctors gave evidence.  

On 26 December 2014, [[#Ruling|the court ruled]] that the life support machine could be turned off.&lt;ref name="it261214"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/court-clears-way-for-clinically-dead-pregnant-woman-to-be-taken-off-life-support-1.2048616|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|first=Mary|last=Carolan|title=Court clears way for clinically dead pregnant woman to be taken off life support|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/ireland-court-rules-brain-dead-pregnant-womans-life-support-switched-off|title=Brain-dead pregnant woman’s life support can be switched off, Irish court rules|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Henry|last=McDonald|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30599063|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Mum-to-be's life support can be shut down, says Dublin court|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the counsel appealed the verdict.

The woman was taken off life support on 27 December, and buried on 29 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2014/1230/Pg004.html#Ar00405|title=Funeral of pregnant woman who was taken off life support|first=Patsy|last=McGarry|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|newspaper=The Irish Times|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/young-pregnant-woman-taken-off-life-support-on-saturday-is-buried-1.2050519|title=Young pregnant woman taken off life support on Saturday is buried|first=Patsy|last=McGarry|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, an [[inquest]] jury returned an [[open verdict]] into the cause of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/coroner-s-court/open-verdict-on-pregnant-woman-taken-off-life-support-1.2361393|title=Open verdict on  pregnant woman taken off life support|last=Carolan|first=Mary|date=22 September 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the family commenced legal action against the HSE, claiming medical negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=27 November 2016|title=Family of pregnant woman on life support sue HSE|first=Mark|last=Tighe|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/family-of-pregnant-woman-on-life-support-sue-hse-c6zrdjt68|accessdate=28 November 2016}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling==
In ruling that life support to be switched off, the court held that the woman's right to [[dignity]] and her family's wishes could take precedence because the chances of the foetus being born alive were infinitesimal. The court rejected an argument that the Eighth Amendment applied only to [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Irish abortion law]] and thus ought not to be invoked in a non-abortion case. The ruling also stated "when the mother who dies is bearing an unborn child at the time of her death, the rights of that child, who is living, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical to those just expressed, must prevail over the feelings of grief and respect for a mother who is no longer living." This left open the possibility of an opposite verdict in a hypothetical similar case further into a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="constitutionproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitutionproject.ie/?p=374|title=High Court Ruling Inevitable in light of Medical Evidence, but Questions Remain for Future Cases|last=O'Mahony|first=Conor|date=26 December 2014|work=Constitution Project|publisher=University College Cork|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prevention''''' is an American healthy lifestyle magazine published by [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hearst.com/magazines/prevention|title=Prevention {{!}} Hearst|website=www.hearst.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring articles about health conditions, wellness, food and nutrition, weight loss, fitness, and beauty. 

== History and Profile ==
Founded in 1950 by [[J. I. Rodale|J.I. Rodale]], ''Prevention'' grew out of his interest in exploring the connection between human health and organic agriculture. Originally advertised as "a medical journal for the people," the magazine launch attracted more than 50,000 subscribers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Roots Grow Deep: The Story of Rodale|last=Gross|first=Daniel|publisher=Rodale|year=2008|isbn=|location=Emmaus, PA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Already controversial for his views promoting organic agriculture, Rodale was determined that the content of his health magazine would be based upon findings in scientific journals, a commitment that continues to this day. 

Rodale Press, along with ''Prevention'' magazine, were among the first publishers to refuse alcohol and tobacco advertising, as well as junk foods or any food with too many additives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/01/business/advertising-magazine-departure-for-rodale.html|title=Advertising; Magazine Departure For Rodale|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prevention'' was the first magazine to state that fresh food was better than processed, to warn that pesticides were posing a danger to the food supply, to promote the benefits of exercise, and to link emotions and attitude with health.&lt;ref&gt;''Prevention'' magazine 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary issue, September 2000, Editor's letter&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ''Prevention'' was acquired by Hearst Magazines along with four other Rodale brands (''[[Men's Health]]'', ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'', ''[[Runner's World]]'', and ''[[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]''). Today, ''Prevention'' is published in both the US and Australia.

'''Red yeast rice''' ({{zh|s=[[:zh:红曲米|红曲米]]|t=[[:zh:红曲米|紅麴米]]|p=hóng qū mǐ|l=red yeast rice}}), '''red rice ''koji''&lt;nowiki /&gt;''' (べにこうじ, lit. 'red ''koji''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'), '''red fermented rice''', '''red kojic rice''', '''red ''koji'' rice''', '''''anka''''', or '''''ang-kak''''', is a bright reddish purple fermented rice, which acquires its colour from being cultivated with the mold ''[[Monascus purpureus]]''.

Red yeast rice is what is referred to as a "koji" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], meaning "grain or bean overgrown with a mold culture", a food preparation tradition going back to ca. 300 BC.&lt;ref name="HoK" /&gt; In both the scientific and popular literature in English that draws principally on Japanese, red yeast rice is most often referred to as "red rice ''koji''".&lt;ref name="HoK"&gt;Shurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A. 2012. History of Koji - Grains and/or Beans Overgrown with a Mold Culture (300 BCE to 2012). Lafayette, California: Soyinfo Center. (With 1,560 references and 142 photos and illustrations)&lt;/ref&gt; English works favoring [[Chinese language|Chinese]] sources may prefer the translation "red yeast rice".

Because of the low cost of chemical dyes, some producers of red yeast rice have adulterated their products with the poisonous dye [[Sudan Red G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=福建"红曲粉"酒被疑含苏丹红 相应酒厂遭查封 |date=2005-04-14 |journal=东南快报 |url=http://news.sohu.com/20050414/n225185743.shtml}} (in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Red yeast rice is produced by cultivating the yeast strain ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' on rice. The rice is first soaked in water until the grains are fully saturated. The raw soaked rice can then either be directly inoculated or it can be steamed for the purpose of sterilizing and cooking the grains prior to inoculation. Inoculation is done by mixing either ''M. purpureus'' spores or powdered red yeast rice together with the rice that is being treated. The mix is then incubated in an environment around room temperature for 3&amp;ndash;6 days. During this period of time, the rice should be fully cultured with ''M. purpureus'', with each rice grain turning bright red in its core and reddish purple on the outside. The fully cultured rice is then either sold as the dried grain, or cooked and pasteurized to be sold as a wet paste, or dried and pulverized to be sold as a fine powder. [[China]] is the world's largest producer of red yeast rice.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Red yeast rice is used to colour a wide variety of food products, including [[pickled tofu]], red [[rice vinegar]], ''[[char siu]]'', [[Peking Duck]], and Chinese pastries that require red food colouring. It is also traditionally used in the production of several types of Chinese ''[[huangjiu]]'' (''[[Shaoxing jiu]]''), and Japanese ''[[sake]]'' (''akaisake''), imparting a reddish colour to these wines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esake.com/Knowledge/Newsletter/JT/JT2001/jt2001_23.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although used mainly for its colour in cuisine, red yeast rice imparts a subtle but pleasant taste to food and is commonly used in the cuisine of [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]] province of China.

===Traditional Chinese medicine===
In addition to its culinary use, red yeast rice is also used in [[Chinese herbology]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Its use has been documented as far back as the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD. It is taken internally to invigorate the body, aid in digestion, and revitalize the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Erdogrull O, Azirak S. (2004). "Review of the studies on the red yeast rice (''Monascus purpureus'')". ''Turkish Electronic J Biotech''. '''2''': 37-49.&lt;/ref&gt; A more complete description is in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, ''Ben Cao Gang Mu-Dan Shi Bu Yi'', from the Ming Dynasty (1378–1644).

===Red yeast rice and drugs===
In the late 1970s, researchers in the United States and Japan were isolating [[lovastatin]] from ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and monacolins from ''[[Monascus]]'', respectively, the latter being the same fungus used to make red yeast rice but cultured under carefully controlled conditions. Chemical analysis soon showed that [[lovastatin]] and monacolin K are identical. The article "The origin of statins" summarizes how the two isolations, documentations and patent applications were just months apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Endo A |title=The origin of the statins. 2004 |journal=Atheroscler Suppl |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=125–30 |date=October 2004 |pmid= 15531285|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosissup.2004.08.033 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovastatin became the patented, prescription drug Mevacor for Merck &amp; Co. Red yeast rice went on to become a contentious non-prescription [[dietary supplement]] in the United States and other countries.

Lovastatin and other prescription "[[statin]]" drugs inhibit cholesterol synthesis by blocking action of the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. As a consequence, circulating total [[cholesterol]] and [[LDL-cholesterol]] are lowered. In a meta-analysis of 91 [[randomized clinical trial]]s of ≥12 weeks duration, totaling 68,485 participants, LDL-cholesterol was lowered by 24-49% depending on the statin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Edwards JE, Moore RA |title=Statins in hypercholesterolaemia: a dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomised, double blind trials |journal=BMC Fam Pract |volume=4|pages=18 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14969594 |pmc=317299 |doi=10.1186/1471-2296-4-18 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different strains of ''Monascus'' fungus will produce different amounts of monacolins. The 'Went' strain of ''Monascus purpureus'' (purpureus = dark red in Latin), when properly fermented and processed, will yield a dried red yeast rice powder that is approximately 0.4% monacolins, of which roughly half will be monacolin K (identical to lovastatin). Monacolin content of a red yeast rice product is described in a 2008 clinical trial report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Becker DJ, Gordon RY, Morris PB, etal |title=Simvastatin vs therapeutic lifestyle changes and supplements: randomized primary prevention trial |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=83 |issue=7 |pages=758–64 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18613992 |doi= 10.4065/83.7.758|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regulatory restrictions====
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) position is that red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K, i.e., lovastatin, are identical to a drug and, thus, subject to regulation as a drug. In 1998, the FDA initiated action to ban a product (Cholestin) containing red yeast rice extract.  The U.S. District Court in Utah allowed the product to be sold without restriction. This decision was reversed on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. (Moore, 2001) (see Further Reading: PDRhealth).  Thereafter, the FDA sent Warning Letters to companies selling red yeast rice.  The product disappeared from the market for a few years.

In 2003, red yeast rice products began to reappear in the U.S. market. In 2007, the FDA sent Warning Letters to two dietary supplement companies. One was making a monacolin content claim about its RYR product and the other was not, but the FDA noted that both products contained monacolins. Both products were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/s6455c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/s6456c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA also issued a warning press release. The crux of the release was that consumers should "… not buy or eat red yeast rice products … may contain an unauthorized drug that could be harmful to health." The rationale for "… harmful to health …" was that consumers might not understand that the dangers of monacolin-containing red yeast rice might be the same as those of prescription statin drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FDA|

  |date=August 9, 2007| archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111224458/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm108962.htm |archive-date=Jan 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 2014, and 2018, [[ConsumerLab.com]] published laboratory tests of red yeast rice supplements purchased from US retailers, most recently stating "the suggested daily servings of only two products provided the amount of lovastatin compounds shown to lower cholesterol levels." The ConsumerLab.com reports include results by brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/Red-Yeast-Rice-Supplements-Review/Red_Yeast_Rice|title=Red Yeast Rice Supplement Reviews and Information|website=ConsumerLab.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Ram Y.|last2=Cooperman|first2=Tod|last3=Obermeyer|first3=William|last4=Becker|first4=David J.|date=2010-10-25|title=Marked Variability of Monacolin Levels in Commercial Red Yeast Rice Products|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/226109|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=170|issue=19|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.382|issn=0003-9926}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study from the [[European Journal of Preventive Cardiology]] (EJPC) tested 28 brands of red yeast rice supplements purchased from US retailers, stating "the quantity of monacolin K varied from none to prescription strength [...]" This European study did not list the individual brands, but only the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Pieter|last2=Avula|first2=Bharathi|last3=Khan|first3=Ikhlas|date=2017-06-23|title=Variability in strength of red yeast rice supplements purchased from mainstream retailers|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487317715714|journal=European Journal of Preventive Cardiology|language=en|volume=24|issue=13|pages=1431–1434|doi=10.1177/2047487317715714|issn=2047-4873|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, there are at least 30 brands available. Many of these avoid the FDA restriction by not having any appreciable monacolin content. Their labels and websites say no more than "fermented according to traditional Asian methods" or "similar to that used in culinary applications." The labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol. If they do not contain lovastatin, do not claim to contain lovastatin, and do not make a claim to lower cholesterol, they are not subject to FDA action. Two reviews confirm that the monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range, with some containing negligible monacolins.&lt;ref name="Li YG, Zhang F, Wang ZT, Hu ZB 2004 1101–12"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li YG, Zhang F, Wang ZT, Hu ZB |title=Identification and chemical profiling of monacolins in red yeast rice using high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector and mass spectrometry |journal=J Pharm Biomed Anal |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1101–12 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15336357 |doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2004.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heber D, Lembertas A, Lu QY, Bowerman S, Go VL |title=An analysis of nine proprietary Chinese red yeast rice dietary supplements: implications of variability in chemical profile and contents |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=133–9 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11327519 |doi=10.1089/107555301750164181 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clinical evidence====
The amount typically used in clinical trials is 1200–2400&amp;nbsp;mg/day of red yeast rice containing approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mg total monacolins, of which half are monacolin K. This does raise a question about the function of the other monacolins and non-monacolin compounds in the products, as the monacolin K content is lower than what is usually considered effective for lovastatin (20–80&amp;nbsp;mg/day). A [[meta-analysis]] of 20 clinical trials, range of red yeast rice dose 1200 to 4800&amp;nbsp;mg/day, reported LDL-cholesterol lowered by 1.02&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (39.4&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) compared to placebo. The incidence of reported adverse effects ranged from 0% to 5% and was not different from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerards MC, Terlou RJ, Yu H, Koks CH, Gerdes VE |title=Traditional Chinese lipid-lowering agent red yeast rice results in significant LDL reduction but safety is uncertain - a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Atherosclerosis |volume=240 |issue=2 |pages=415–23 |year=2015 |pmid=25897793 |doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this review, the largest and longest duration trial was conducted in China: the China Coronary Secondary Prevention Study (CCSPS). Close to 5,000 post-heart attack patients were enrolled for an average of 4.5 years to receive either a placebo or a RYR product named Xuezhikang (血脂康). The test product was an ethanol extract of red yeast rice, with a monacolin K content of 11.6&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Key CCSPS results: In the treated group, risk of subsequent heart attacks was reduced by 45%, cardio deaths by 31%, and all-cause deaths by 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lu ZL |title=[China coronary secondary prevention study (CCSPS)] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=109–115 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15924803 |doi= |url= |author2=Collaborative Group for China Coronary Secondary Prevention Using Xuezhikang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCSPS heart attack and cardiovascular death outcomes appear to be better than what has been reported for prescription statin drugs. A 2008 review pointed out that the cardioprotective effects of statins in Japanese populations occur at lower doses than are needed in Western populations, and theorized that the low amount of monacolins found in Xuezhikang might have been more effectively athero-protective than expected in the Chinese population in the CCSPS study for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ong HT, Cheah JS |title=Statin alternatives or just placebo: an objective review of omega-3, red yeast rice and garlic in cardiovascular therapeutics |journal=Chin. Med. J. |volume=121 |issue=16 |pages=1588–1594 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18982874 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety====
The safety of red yeast rice products has not been established, and some commercial supplements have been found to contain high levels of the [[toxin]] [[citrinin]].&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = R. Y. | last2 = Cooperman | first2 = T. | last3 = Obermeyer | first3 = W. | last4 = Becker | first4 = D. J. | title = Marked Variability of Monacolin Levels in Commercial Red Yeast Rice Products: Buyer Beware! | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 170 | issue = 19 | pages = 1722–1727 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20975018 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.382}}&lt;/ref&gt; As commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins,&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; and rarely declare this content on the label, defining risk is difficult. Ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of "spiking" red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin. As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds.&lt;ref name="Li YG, Zhang F, Wang ZT, Hu ZB 2004 1101–12"/&gt; Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage.  Statin-associated [[rhabdomyolysis]] can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure ([[renal failure]]). This is why they are prescription drugs rather than over-the-counter, and with recommendations that the patients' physicians schedule liver function tests on a regular basis. There are reports in the literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert C, Bres V, Jean-Pastor MJ, Guy C, Lebrun-Vignes B, Robin P, Pinzani V, Hillaire-Buys D |title=[Red yeast-rice-induced muscular injuries: Analysis of French pharmacovigilance database and literature review] |language=French |journal=Thérapie |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2016 |pmid=28277227 |doi=10.2515/therapie/2015053 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Becker ''et al.'' reported on a U.S. trial that enrolled 62 patients with known statin-associated [[myalgia]]s. Half got a RYR product (3600&amp;nbsp;mg/day, 13&amp;nbsp;mg monacolins, 6&amp;nbsp;mg monacolin k) for 24 weeks; and half were administered a placebo. In the treated group, LDL-cholesterol declined 21%. Two patients dropped out because of myalgia, 1 for diarrhea, and 1 for dizziness. In the placebo group, one dropped out for myalgia. [[Creatine phosphokinase]] increased slightly in the treated group (from 122 to 128 IU/L) versus decreasing with placebo (117 to 101 IU/L), but the shifts were not statistically significant. For those having completed the trial, subjective muscle pain scores were similar for the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker DJ, Gordon RY, Halbert SC, French B, Morris PB, Rader DJ |title=Red yeast rice for dyslipidemia in statin-intolerant patients: a randomized trial |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=150 |issue=12 |pages=830–9, W147–9 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19528562 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-150-12-200906160-00006|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR is similar to that of statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions."&lt;ref&gt;Mazzanti G, Paola A, et al.

Red yeast is likely unsafe during pregnancy. It has caused birth defects in animals, and there is not enough information about the safety of using red yeast during breast-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medline Plus: Red Yeast monograph|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/925.html|website=Medline Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse vaccinology''' is an improvement on [[vaccinology]] that employs bioinformatics, pioneered by [[Rino Rappuoli]] and first used against  Serogroup B [[meningococcus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pizza et al. ''Identification of Vaccine Candidates Against Serogroup B Meningococcus by Whole-Genome Sequencing'' &lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt; 2000 287:1816-1820&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, it has been used on several other bacterial vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;Rappuoli, Rino. ''Reverse Vaccinology'' &lt;u&gt;Current Opinion in Microbiology&lt;/u&gt; 2000, 3:445–450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational approach==
The basic idea behind reverse vaccinology is that an entire [[pathogen]]ic [[genome]] can be screened using [[bioinformatics]] approaches to find genes.  Some of the traits that the genes are monitored for that may indicate antigenicity include genes that code for proteins with extracellular localization, signal peptides, and B-cell [[epitope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;CH Woelk, et al. "Improving reverse vaccinology with a machine learning approach." Vaccine 29, no. 45 (n.d.): 8156-8164. Science Citation Index, EBSCOhost (accessed September 30, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Next, those genes are filtered for desirable attributes that would make good vaccine targets such as outer [[membrane protein]]s. Once the candidates are identified, they are produced synthetically and are screened in animal models of the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Michalik, M., Djahanshiri, B., Leo, J. C., &amp; Linke, D. (2016). Reverse Vaccinology: The Pathway from Genomes and Epitope Predictions to Tailored Recombinant Vaccines. [[Methods in Molecular Biology]], 1403, 87–106. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3387-7_4&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After Craig Venter published the genome of the first free-living organism in 1995, the genomes of other microorganisms became more readily available throughout the end of the twentieth century. Reverse vaccinology, designing vaccines using the pathogen’s sequenced genome, came from this new wealth of genomic information, as well as technological advances. Reverse vaccinology is much more efficient than traditional vaccinology, which requires growing large amounts of specific microorganisms as well as extensive wet lab tests.

In 2000, Rino Rappuoli and the J. Craig Venter Institute developed the first [[vaccine]] using Reverse Vaccinology against Serogroup B meningococcus. The J. Craig Venter institute and others then continued work on vaccines for A Streptococcus, B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus auereus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"&gt;Alessandro S, Rino R. Review: Reverse Vaccinology: Developing Vaccines in the Era of Genomics. Immunity [serial online]. n.d.;33:530-541. Available from: ScienceDirect, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reverse Vaccinology with Meningococcus B==
Attempts at reverse vaccinology first began with Meningococcus B (MenB). Meningococcus B caused over 50% of meningococcal meningitis, and scientists had been unable to create a successful vaccine for the pathogen because of the bacterium’s unique structure. This bacterium’s polysaccharide shell is identical to that of a human self-antigen, but its surface proteins vary greatly; and the lack of information about the surface proteins caused developing a vaccine to be extremely difficult. As a result, Rino Rappuoli and other scientists turned towards bioinformatics to design a functional vaccine.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;

Rappuoli and others at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] first sequenced the MenB genome. Then, they scanned the sequenced genome for potential antigens. They found over 600 possible antigens, which were tested by expression in [[Escherichia coli]]. The most universally applicable antigens were used in the prototype vaccines. Several proved to function successfully in mice, however, these proteins alone did not effectively interact with the human immune system due to not inducing a good immune response in order for the protection to be achieved. Later,  by addition of outer membrane vesicles that contain [[lipopolysaccharides]] from the purification of blebs on gram negative cultures. The addition of this adjuvant (previously identified by using conventional vaccinology approaches) enhanced immune response to the level that was required. Later, the vaccine was proven to be safe and effective in adult humans.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;

==Subsequent Reverse Vaccinology Research==
During the development of the MenB vaccine, scientists adopted the same Reverse Vaccinology methods for other bacterial pathogens. A [[Streptococcus]] and B [[Streptococcus]] vaccines were two of the first Reverse Vaccines created. Because those bacterial strains induce antibodies that react with human antigens, the vaccines for those bacteria needed to not contain homologies to proteins encoded in the human genome in order to not cause adverse reactions, thus establishing the need for genome-based Reverse Vaccinology.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;

Later, Reverse Vaccinology was used to develop vaccines for antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae &lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;

==Pros and cons==
The major advantage for reverse vaccinology is finding vaccine targets quickly and efficiently. Traditional methods may take decades to unravel pathogens and antigens, diseases and immunity. However, ''In silico'' can be very fast, allowing to identify new vaccines for testing in only a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Rappuoli, R. &amp; A. Aderem. 2011. A 2020 Vision for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Nature 473: 463.&lt;/ref&gt;  The downside is that only proteins can be targeted using this process.  Whereas, conventional vaccinology approaches can find other biomolecular targets such as [[polysaccharide]]s.

==Available Software==
Though using bioinformatic technology to develop vaccines has become typical in the past ten years, general laboratories often do not have the advanced software that can do this. However, there are a growing number of programs making reverse vaccinology information more accessible. NERVE is one relatively new dataprocessing program. Though it must be downloaded and does not include all epitope predictions, it does help save some time by combining the computational steps of reverse vaccinology into one program. Vaxign, an even more comprehensive program, was created in 2008. Vaxign is web-based and completely public-access.&lt;ref&gt;He Y, Xiang Z, Mobley H. Vaxign: the first web-based vaccine design program for reverse vaccinology and applications for vaccine development. Journal of Biomedicine &amp; Biotechnology [serial online]. 2010;Available from: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Vaxign has been found to be extremely accurate and efficient, some scientists still utilize the online software RANKPEP for the peptide bonding predictions. Both Vaxign and RANKPEP employ PSSMs (Position Specific Scoring Matrices) when analyzing protein sequences or sequence alignments.&lt;ref&gt;Reche PA, Glutting JP and Reinherz EL. Prediction of MHC Class I Binding Peptides Using Profile Motifs. Human Immunology 63, 701-709 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer Aided bioinformatics projects are becoming extremely popular, as they help guide the laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro V, Jennifer L. G, Francesco F, et al.

Accessed September 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Developments because of Reverse Vaccinology and Bioinformatics==

*Reverse vaccinology has caused an increased focus on pathogenic biology.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;
*Reverse vaccinology led to the discovery of pili in gram-positive pathogens such as A streptococcus, B streptococcus, and pneumococcus. Previously, all gram-positive bacteria were thought to not have any pili.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;
*Reverse vaccinology also led to the discovery of factor G binding protein in meningococcus, which binds to complement factor H in humans. Binding to the complement factor H allows for meningococcus to grow in human blood while blocking alternative pathways. This model does not fit many animal species, which do not have the same complement factor H as humans, indicating differentiation of meningococcus between differing species.&lt;ref name="Alessandro S 2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6591">'''Robert Portner''' (1837-1906) was a successful grocer-turned-brewer who supplied beer to Union troops during the Civil War. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, Portner found success after the war with the Robert Portner Brewing Company. Portner patented two brewing-related systems, one to purify air and the other to cool beer.

== Early life ==
Robert Portner was born in [[Rahden]], [[Westphalia]], [[Prussia]] on March 20, 1837 and immigrated to the United States in 1853. Portner spent eight years in New York and tried his hand at many professions, including baker, tobacconist, and saloon-keeper. 

In 1861, with the outbreak of the Civil War, Portner wanted to see the action up close and personal.  He traveled south to [[Alexandria, Virginia]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)]] where he bought a grocery store with his friend Frederick Recker and the two men found success selling food and supplies to Union soldiers stationed in the area.  Noting the difficulty in importing beer, Portner and Recker paired with Edward Abner and a local brewer to form Portner and Company, where they brewed their own beer to sell to the troops. 

== Robert Portner, Brewer==
After the war, Portner and Company dissolved. Recker kept the grocery store and Portner focused on expanding the brewery. Portner learned the brewing process and eventually brewed enough to require storage cellars. He was in debt at the time and asked for extensions on his loans. Union Soldiers had left Alexandria and the demand for beer was not as high as it once was. The brewery continued to grow and Portner was able to pay off his debts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennée|first1=Timothy J.|title=Robert Portner and His Brewing Company|date=2010|publisher=Saul Centers, Inc. Parsons Engineering Science, Inc. and Alexandria Archaeology|location=Alexandria, VA|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/SiteReportDenneePortnerBreweryHistoryAX196.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portner patented a system for chilling lager as well as an ice-making machine that improved the quality of his beer. He eventually had fifty refrigerated train cars used to ship his product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peck|first1=Garrett|title=Capital Beer: A Heady History of Brewing in Washington, D.C.|date=2014|publisher=American Palate: A Division of The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-62619-441-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his successes, Portner further expanded his company to include beer gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennée|first1=Timothy J.|title=Robert Portner and His Brewing Company|date=2010|publisher=Saul Centers, Inc. Parsons Engineering Science, Inc. and Alexandria Archaeology|location=Alexandria, VA|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/SiteReportDenneePortnerBreweryHistoryAX196.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robert Portner Brewing Company ==
In 1883, Portner had his brewery incorporated and sold shares of stock to his most successful employees.  The first Board of Directors included himself as President, Paul Muhlhauser as Vice-President, Charles A. Strangmann as Secretary &amp; Treasurer, and C. G. Herbort &amp; B. Edward J. Eils.  Over the next thirty-three years the brewery expanded and grew to cover two full city blocks and all the latest technological advancements.  Depots and bottling houses throughout the South helped to expand the brewery's network, reaching as far south as [[Augusta, Georgia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)]].  Ultimately the brewery closed when [[Prohibition]] took effect in Virginia in 1916.  Portner's sons tried to keep the company alive by changing the name to the Virginia Feed &amp; Milling Corporation and converting the brewery into a feed and grain business but did not fare nearly as well, and the company was out of business by 1930.

== Annaburg ==
In 1869, Portner was visited by Christian Mathis and Peter Valaer with an invitation to join Peter's brother Jacob as a partner in his brewery and [[Winter garden]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  He visited Valaer's business, and though he was interested he knew he could not extract himself from his brewery in Alexandria.  It was here, though, that he met Jacob and Peter's sister, Anna, whom he fell in love with and would marry in 1872.

In 1883, Portner bought Mathis' estate in [[Manassas, Virginia]], Virginia.  When they had visited in the past, Portner's wife had said that the land, with its view of the [[Bull Run Mountains]], reminded her of her homeland in [[Switzerland]], and that she loved it.  As time went on, Portner purchased more and more surrounding farmland, growing his estate to nearly 2,500 acres.  It would encompass a large portion of the Civil War battlefield, a historic [[Liberia (Manassas, Virginia)|pre-war house]], and the [[Fortification]] Fort Beauregard.  Portner managed to turn miles of battle-scarred earth and scraggly cornfields into lush pastures for his stock and dairy farm, as well as considerably expand Mathis' original orchards and vineyards.

By 1890, the [[Italianate]] house on the property had become too small for their family.  He had the house moved and, working with prominent architect Gustav Friebus, Portner designed a new home that would combine elements of his favorite European mansions.  Built between 1892 and 1894 at a cost of $150,000, Annaburg was a three-story, thirty-five room architectural gem, complete with indoor plumbing, electricity, and porches that wrapped around three sides.  It also featured climate control system which combined two of Portner's brewery inventions, making it what is believed to be the first house in the country to have air-conditioning.

== Later Life &amp; Death ==
Throughout his life, Portner suffered from weak nerves and [[rheumatism]].  As the stress of his multiple businesses mounted, as well as combating the ever-growing anti-saloon sentiment throughout the country, Portner found himself gradually weaker and in ill health.  He took multiple trips to Europe to recuperate, none of which helped long term.  By 1903 he had all but formally retired from active business activities and was living full-time at Annaburg.  It was here, surrounded by his family, that he died on May 29, 1906.  He was buried in the Manassas Cemetery three days later.

[[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] '''Sir Edward Willis Duncan Ward, 1st Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GBE|KCB|KCVO}} (17 December 1853&amp;ndash;11 September 1928) was a [[British Army]] officer and military administrator, serving as [[Permanent Secretary]] of the [[War Office]].  He was a notable reformer of army administration, improving efficiency of mobilization, medical services and supplies.
[[File:EdwardWardBrompton01.jpg|thumb|right|Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London]]

==Military career==
Ward was born in [[Oban]] in 1853, the only son of Captain John Ward, RN, by his wife Mary Hope Bowie.&lt;ref name="Grant2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Grant|title=Philanthropy and Voluntary Action in the First World War: Mobilizing Charity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6nmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|date=18 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-50031-4|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned [[Sub-Lieutenant]] in the 2nd Royal Lanarkshire Militia in December 1873, and transferred to the [[2nd West India Regiment]] in February 1874. In April 1874 he transferred into the [[Control Department]] as a Sub-Assistant Commissary, transferring to the new [[Commissariat and Transport Department]] in 1875, although he did not resign his militia commission until December 1874. He was promoted Assistant Commissary in 1876. In January 1880 the department changed its name to the [[Commissariat and Transport Staff]] and Ward became a Deputy Assistant Commissary-General in the new organisation.&lt;ref name="Grant2014"/&gt;

In April 1885 Commissariat and Transport Staff officers were given honorary military rank and Ward also became a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]].  He was with Sir Garnet Wolseley's sojourn up the Nile to recapture Khartoum.  In December 1885 he was promoted to Assistant Commissary-General and [[Major]]. In December 1888 the department underwent yet another change, becoming the [[Army Service Corps]], with its officers now holding full military rank. He was promoted [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in June 1890.  He went on the Ashanti Expedition in West Africa in 1895-6.  Ward returned to England and was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Colonel]] in March 1898.

== Boer War ==
Ward sailed with the first ships to Cape Town Harbour in September 1899.  After the [[Siege of Ladysmith]], [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir George White]] called him 'the greatest supply officer since Moses'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19280922.2.62.aspx?keyword=%22edward+ward%22&amp;sort=relevance&amp;page=1&amp;sessionid=9dfe8fbd938249ef9e6b58937d4831cf Late Sir Edward Ward. The Straits Times, 22 September 1928, Page 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 while on campaign he was appointed director of Supplies to the South African Field Force by Lord Roberts.  Ward had begun life in the administration of military supplies.  His organizational abilities were quickly discovered by after the chaotic state of affairs in 1899, the changes were most welcome.  Lord Salisbury directed him to take up the position of Permanent Under-secretary at the War Office under Secretary St John Brodrick.  A successful and competent civil servant Colonel Ward was elevated to a baronetcy  [[Ward Baronets|of Wilbraham Place]], in 1914 by the Liberal government overseeing the radical reforms of the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]]. Ward could be credited, as his own publication revealed for founding the [[Army Service Corps]]; it played a decisive role in the BEF, keeping the logistics and transport departments supplied to the front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/21360498 Retrieved 22 July 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward was a President of the [[Union Jack Club]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19280912.2.25.aspx?keyword=%22edward+ward%22+jack&amp;sort=relevance&amp;page=1&amp;sessionid=8d8882e3b3ac4c06852172f535709719 Death of Sir Edward Ward. The Straits Times, 12 September 1928, Page 8]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chairman of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].  In 1919 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.

==Family==
In 1880 he married Florence Caroline Simons (1858–1934).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/arthur-charles-fox-davies/armorial-families--a-directory-of-gentlemen-of-coat-armour-volume-2-dxo/page-245-armorial-families--a-directory-of-gentlemen-of-coat-armour-volume-2-dxo.shtml Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, Armorial families : a directory of gentlemen of coat-armour (Volume 2), ebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Captain Edward Simons Ward (1882–1930).  Together with [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 3rd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava]] and Viscountess Ednam, he died when their aeroplane returning to London from [[Le Touquet]] exploded in midair over [[Meopham]], Kent.  Captain Ward was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, Melvill Willis Ward (1885–1973), as the 3rd Baronet.  The title became extinct on his brother's death.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''St. Mary's General Hospital''' is an acute care hospital offering a broad range of health care services and community outreach programs. The hospital campus is located in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] on a plot of land bordered on the south by Oak Street, the north by Crescent Avenue, the west by Lafayette Avenue, and the east by Boulevard.

St. Mary's address, officially, is 350 Boulevard. For most of its existence, however, the hospital operated at a facility located at 211 Pennington Avenue in the Passaic Park section of the city. It is affiliated with the [[Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth]], a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] convent in [[Morris Township, New Jersey]].

As of 2014, St. Mary's is owned by [[Prime Healthcare Services]]. It added the "General" to its name following the acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primehealthcare.com/Press-Center/News/2014/Prime-Healthcare-Services-Acquires-St-Mary-s-Hos.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
St. Mary’s Hospital currently serves approximately 13,000 inpatients annually, in addition to caring for 10,500 patients requiring same-day procedures.

==History of hospitals in Passaic==
Construction of St. Mary's original location began on May 23, 1897.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14699626/the_new_passaic_hospital/|title=The New Passaic Hospital|date=1897-05-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14699866/passaics_catholic_hospital/|title=Passaic's Catholic Hospital|date=1897-05-24|work=Harrisburg Daily Independent|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Other accounts, likely mistaken, indicate that it was almost completed in March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14699894/st_marys_erection/|title=St. Mary's Erection|date=1897-03-12|work=Middletown Daily Argus|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Until then, the city had only a medical dispensary, but not a full service hospital facility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was some controversy between competing groups over the building of a new hospital, but both groups appear to have succeeded in opening separate institutions at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14711676/hospital_governors_in_a_row/|title=Hospital Governors in a Row|date=1896|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14714020/tetanus_antitoxin_successfully/|title=Tetanus Antitoxin Successfully Administered|date=1898-10-20|work=Reading Times|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other hospitals opened later, giving the city three hospitals for many years. They all eventually merged into a single remaining entity, today's St. Mary's. Though each provided full-service hospital facilities, each predecessor Passaic hospital had its own specialty.
*[[File:Passaic General Hospital - First Building.jpg|thumb|Original General Hospital complex. on the site of the current St. Mary's campus.]]Passaic General Hospital, later known as The General Hospital Center at Passaic, was located at 350 Boulevard (St. Mary's present location). Passaic General's specialty was cardiology, renowned for its Eastern Heart Institute and for pioneering the first open heart surgery in the state. It opened on November 1, 1897, despite thin financing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14713571/general_hospital_may_close/|title=General Hospital May Close|date=1901-09-27|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=2017-10-27|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital grounds were donated for the purpose by descendants of the Aycrigg family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xd9EAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;ots=0RL8r8vdbm&amp;dq=tony's%20nose%20passaic&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The News' History of Passaic: From the Earliest Settlement to the Present Day ...|last=Pape|first=William Jamieson|last2=1873|first2=William Jamieson Pape b|last3=Scott|first3=William Winfield|date=1899|publisher=News Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Passaic Beth Israel Hospital, often known as '''PBI,''' was the city's other sectarian hospital. It was funded by the located [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] community, and located on Parker Avenue near Passaic's northern border with neighboring Clifton. It was a leader in treating cancer, having respected center of excellence in the field on oncology. PBI later merged with Passaic General.

[[File:St Marys Hospital First Building.png|thumb|First Purpose-built St. Mary's building]]

* St. Mary's Hospital was lauded for its maternal-child and behavioral health programs. The original hospital complex was at 211 Pennington Avenue in Passaic Park. St. Mary's later bought the assets of the other two hospitals and moved to the 350 Boulevard location, where it continues to operate. St. Mary's first hospital opened on August 15, 1895, in a club house near St. Nicholas Catholic Church on Washington Street. The church's rector purchased the Pennington Avenue site at about the same time, and the building opened November 8, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xd9EAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;ots=0RL8r8vdbm&amp;dq=tony's%20nose%20passaic&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The News' History of Passaic: From the Earliest Settlement to the Present Day ...|last=Pape|first=William Jamieson|last2=1873|first2=William Jamieson Pape b|last3=Scott|first3=William Winfield|date=1899|publisher=News Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000-2004: merging of General and Beth Israel, eventual bankruptcy===
In 2000, Atlantic Health Systems acquired the General Hospital Center at Passaic. Four years later, the owners of Beth Israel Hospital bought General from Atlantic and closed the Parker Avenue facility, merging the operations of both hospitals into the Boulevard facility. The merged hospital took on the name [[PBI Regional Medical Center]]. Within two years, PBI Regional filed for bankruptcy due to mismanagement from administration and staff. 

===2006: St. Mary's steps in===
St. Mary's, which was having problems maintaining its 112-year-old facility, was called on to save the failing hospital and received a grant from the state to purchase the hospital and move their operations to the Boulevard site, thus leaving Passaic with one surviving hospital.

Although on March 9, 2009, St. Mary's Hospital filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection, a federal bankruptcy judge approved of its reorganization plan less than a year from filing, as reported in the week of March 2, 2010. "St. Mary's emerges from Chapter 11 stronger and better than before," said Michael J. Sniffen, St. Mary's president/CEO, in a media release. "After less than one year, we emerge revitalized, improved, and re-committed to serving the community and the physicians that have so loyally supported us through this difficult process." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bankruptcy Judge OKs St. Mary's Hospital's Reorganization Plan  |url=http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/FIN-246030/Bankruptcy-Judge-OKs-St-Marys-Hospitals-Reorganization-Plan##}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility on Pennington Avenue was maintained for psychiatric admissions and care for some time after the rest of the hospital moved. However, St. Mary's closed its psychiatric unit on May 12, 2009, transferring admissions to [[Clara Maass Medical Center]] in [[Belleville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/health/99578249_economy_to_blame_for_increase_in_mental_health_problems_experts_say.html NorthJersey.com: Recession victims crying out for help]&lt;/ref&gt; The Psychiatric Emergency Screening Unit moved to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson; this unit is the primary facility used for psychiatric emergency care in Passaic County.[2] This now leaves the original facility empty. From 2009 to 2010 the building was used by NBC to film episodes of the first season of the medical drama [[Mercy (TV series)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEFunNINYhT9JL|title= EXCLUSIVE: Guillermo Diaz Takes Us Into the World of Weeds|accessdate= 2009-07-03|author= Brian Gallagher|date= 2009-06-11|publisher= MovieWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
Physician and poet [[William Carlos Williams]] was affiliated with St. Mary's predecessor, Passaic General Hospital, where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics. The hospital paid tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states "we walk the wards that Williams walked."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutherfordlibrary.typepad.com/williamcarloswilliams/st-marys-hospital-wcw-fund/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev0807112#t=article]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR)''' is a global report that provides an authoritative, comprehensive assessment of the world’s freshwater resources.  It is produced annually by the [[World Water Assessment Programme]] and released by [[UN-Water]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report examines the ways that the world’s water resources are being managed and the varied water problems that different regions of the world are experiencing. It takes a close look at growing water problems worldwide, such as access to clean water and sanitation, and the cross-cutting issues which affect them, such as energy, climate change, agriculture, and urban growth.   The Report also offers recommendations on how freshwater resources could be managed more sustainably.

The content of the Report comes from the coordinated efforts of 26 UN agencies that make up [[UN-Water]], working with governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwater.org/documents.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the topic of the report was "[[Nature-based solutions|Nature-based Solutions]] for Water".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2017, the topic of the report was "Wastewater: The Untapped Resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017.

==Background==
In 1998, the Sixth Session of the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] stated that there was a need for regular, global assessments on the status of freshwater resources.  In response to this recommendation, the member organizations of [[UN-Water]] (known then as the ACC Subcommittee on Water Resources) decided to produce a World Water Development Report every three years, with an aim to reporting on the status of global freshwater resources and the progress achieved in reaching the [[Millennium Development Goals]] related to water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=40361&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html External Evaluation of UNESCO's Contribution to the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The UN World Water Development Reports monitor changes in the world’s freshwater resources and their management. They track progress towards achieving international development targets, particularly those of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), and offer best practices as well as in-depth theoretical analyses to help stimulate ideas and actions for better stewardship in the water sector.

The WWDRs also include the findings of case study development projects initiated in different geographic regions of the world. The case studies provide an in-depth analysis of the state of freshwater resources and related challenges that directly affect the livelihoods of people in the societies. In the production of WWDRs, more than 64 countries have been covered at basin or national level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/case_studies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

=== 2018: Nature for Water ===
The 2018 Report was launched 19 March 2018 during the 8th [[World Water Forum]], and in conjunction to the [[World Water Day]] (22 March 2018).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; Its title was "[[Nature-based Solutions]] for Water".

=== 2017: Wastewater: The Untapped Resource ===

=== 2012: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk ===
The fourth Report was launched at the sixth World Water Forum in Marseille, France in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr4-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; Its title was "Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk".

===2009: Water in a Changing World===

The third Report, “Water in a Changing World”, was launched at the fifth [[World Water Forum]] held in Istanbul, Turkey in March, 2009.

Unlike the earlier Reports, which were structured along UN agency lines, “Water in a Changing World” took a holistic approach, addressing a number of themes throughout the report, such as climate change, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), groundwater, biodiversity, water and migration, water and infrastructure, and biofuels. The Report has four main sections, apart from the introduction and the recommendations: “drivers of change,” “the use of the resource for humans and for ecosystems,” “the state of the resource,” and “responding to a changing world: what are the options?”

''Case Studies'':  The third Report is accompanied by the first stand-alone volume of WWAP case studies, titled "Facing the Challenges", which includes 20 studies from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Latin America, where conditions of water-related stress and socio-economic settings vary widely.  Case studies include the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain), Bangladesh, Cameroon, China, the Cholistan desert (Pakistan), Estonia, the Han River basin (Republic of Korea), Istanbul (Turkey), the Lake Merín basin (Brazil and Uruguay), La Plata River basin (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay), the Netherlands, Pacific island states, the Po River basin (Italy), Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, the Vuoksi River basin (Finland and the Russian Federation) and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006: Water: A Shared Responsibility (2006)===

The second WWDR, “Water: A Shared Responsibility,” was presented in 2006 at the fourth [[World Water Forum]] in Mexico City, Mexico.  Building on the conclusions of the first WWDR, the Report provides an assessment of freshwater resources in all regions and most countries of the world as it tracks progress towards the water-related targets of the UN Millennium Development Goals. It examines a range of key issues including population growth and increasing urbanization, changing ecosystems, food production, health, industry and energy, as well as risk management, valuing and paying for water and increasing knowledge and capacity. Sixteen case studies look at typical water resource challenges and provide valuable insights into different facets of the water crisis and management responses.  Finally, the report outlines a set of conclusions and recommendations to guide future action and encourage sustainable use, productivity and management of our increasingly scarce freshwater resources.

''Case studies'': The second Report contains 16 case studies, including the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain), the Danube River Basin (Albania, Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Republic of Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;Referred to by the United Nations as "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" due to the [[Macedonia naming dispute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine), Ethiopia, France, Japan, Kenya, Lake Peipsi (Estonia and the Russian Federation), Lake Titicaca (Peru and Bolivia), Mali, Mexico, Mongolia, the La Plata River Basin (Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay), South Africa and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr2&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003: Water for People, Water for Life (2003)===

The first UN World Water Development Report, called “Water for People, Water for Life” was presented at the third World Water Forum in Japan in 2003. The Report provides an assessment of the globe’s water crisis; reviews progress and trends; proposes methodologies and indicators for measuring sustainability; assesses progress in 11 challenge areas (health, food, environment, shared water resources, cities, industry, energy, risk management, knowledge, valuing water and governance); and, presents seven pilot case studies of river basins representing various social, economic and environmental settings.

''Case Studies'': The first Report looked at seven case studies, including the Chao Phraya River basin (Thailand), Greater Tokyo (Japan), Lake Peipsi/Chudskoe-Pskovskoe (Estonia, Russian Federation), Lake Titicaca basin (Bolivia, Peru), Ruhuna basins (Sri Lanka), Seine-Normandy basin (France), and the Senegal River basin (Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7078">'''Virodene''' is an [[AIDS]] drug developed in [[South Africa]], but rejected by the scientific community. Controversy surrounds the research procedures, political interference and the safety and efficacy of the drug itself, the main active ingredient of which is the industrial solvent [[Dimethylformamide]] (DMF).

[[Michelle Olga Patricia Visser]], working as a medical technician at Pretoria Hospital, says she discovered the anti-bacterial properties of DMF while conducting experiments to freeze animal hearts using this substance. In conjunction with her businessman husband, Jacques Siegfried "Zigi" Visser, she administered the drug to 11 patients without approval. They were rebuked for these actions and the South African Medicines Control Council blocked further human trials.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news

More human trials were conducted in [[Tanzania]] in 2000 even after the [[South African Medicines Control Council]] ruled that such trials would be unethical and in contravention of the law and refused permission for human trials in 1998. The Tanzania health agency, NIMR, also rejected proposals for human trials, but the Vissers approached the Tanzanian Defence Force directly and conducted the trials in military hospitals.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

Calls have now been made in some circles for an investigation of South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s involvement in support or funding of the company.&lt;ref name="investigate"&gt;{{cite news

==Controversy==
===Fraudulent credentials===
Olga Visser claimed she was a full professor and head of the department of New Technologies in Medicine at [[Moderna University]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], but officials insist there is no record of her on the faculty or even of such a department.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

===Human trials===
On several occasions the Vissers conducted human trials without any authorisation from the appropriate health authorities.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

===Political interference===
In 1997 the researchers were allowed to make presentations to the South African Cabinet. They received support from [[Thabo Mbeki]], then South African deputy president and [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]], the health minister at the time. Mbeki even criticised the Medicines Control Council, stating that "it became more and more difficult to understand the attitude adopted by the MCC" and that "I and many others will not rest until the efficacy or otherwise of Virodene is established scientifically" in direct opposition to the rejection of human trials by the Medicines Control Council.&lt;ref name="Mbeki"&gt;{{Cite web

In the same letter Mbeki went as far as suggesting that parties who caused the controversy surrounding Virodene wanted to create the AIDS pandemic in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]:
{{Quote|Two thirds of those affected world-wide are in Sub-Saharan Africa, including a 2,8 million strong South African contingent.

Often I have wondered whether those who have generated sand storms with the greatest enthusiasm, did not, in fact, seek to achieve precisely this result!|Thabo Mbeki|&lt;ref name="Mbeki"/&gt;}}

Some analysts point out that the mere involvement of senior government officials in a regulatory process for which there exists well established regulatory bodies such as the Medicines Control Council could only ever serve to open up the process to charges of maladministration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
====ANC====
In 1999 it was revealed that several businessmen with close ties to Mbeki —by then [[President of South Africa]]— such as Max Maisela, invested heavily into the Virodene companies.&lt;ref name="MailandGuardian"&gt;{{cite news
 |title       = Who's bankrolling Virodene?

 |df          = mdy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maisela was on Mbeki's "consultative council" during Mbeki's tenure as Deputy President and at the time of the investments headed Negotiated Benefits Consultants (NBC) which was owned by Worldwide Africa Holdings a company co-founded by [[Wiseman Nkhuhlu]], then presidential advisor to Mbeki.&lt;ref name="MailandGuardian"/&gt;

Reports alleging investment from source close to government again surface in 2007. The fresh reports by the newspaper ''The Saturday Star'' suggested investments between 2000 and 2001 that tapered off after the trials in Tanzania were aborted, allegations denied by the Presidency.&lt;ref name="denial"&gt;{{cite news

====Alcor Life Extension Foundation====
{{see also|Alcor Life Extension Foundation}}
Initial funding came from the controversial [[cryonics]] (low temperature preservation of humans after death) company Alcor Life. The funding came because of the main Virodene founder's research into the freezing and thawing of animal hearts.

In [[Russia]], approximately 70 per cent of drinking water comes from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater. In 2004, water supply systems had a total capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day. The average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations:[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/russia/RussiaSanitation04f.pdf SANITATION COUNTRY PROFILE RUSSIAN FEDERATION], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; One fourth of the world’s fresh surface and [[groundwater]] is located in Russia. The water utilities sector is one of the largest industries in Russia serving the entire Russian population.

== Service quality ==
[[File:C0141-Kstovo-Volga.jpg|thumb|left|Water purification station (two round towers) on the [[Volga]] waterfront in [[Kstovo]]]]
'''Sanitation''' In 2002, the capacity of the wastewater treatment plants was 56.1 million cubic metres a day, which is about the same as the 1995 level.  The length of the sewerage network was 118,000&amp;nbsp;km. The amount of wastewater passing through the plants in 2002 represents 86 per cent of wastewater emitted. Of this, only 28 per cent is treated in accordance with the established regulations, while the remainder is discharged, insufficiently treated, into rivers, lakes and the sea. 60 per cent of the wastewater treatment plants are overloaded and 38 per cent have been in operation for 25 to 30 years and need to be reconstructed. The deficit in the capacity of sewerage systems at present is more than 9 million cubic metres a day. 9,616 sewerage systems are in operation, but 44 towns (4 per cent) and 582 urban type settlements (27 per cent) still had no central sewerage system in 2002.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

==Service provision by the private sector==
As of 2014, there were at least 23 contracts with private companies to manage water utilities or plants with an investment commitment of almost 2 billion US dollars. 18 contracts cover entire utilities and 5 contracts cover individual plants. 5 of these contracts were signed before 2002, 17 in the 2003-2006 period. Only one contract - a 100 million dollars concession in [[Voronezh]] signed in 2012 - was awarded after 2006. 8 of the 23 contracts are held by the conglomerate [[Alfa Group]] either directly or through its subsidiary [[Rosvodokanal]]. Its Russian competitor Integrated Energy Systems Holding (IES) holds four lease contracts. The largest foreign investor in the Russian water sector is Austrian [[EVN Group]], which holds three contracts for treatment plants. These include the largest water contract in Russia for the South-West Moscow drinking water plant, which was signed in 2004 with an investment commitment of 220 million US dollars. The French water company [[Veolia]] is engaged in Russia through a contract for the Southern Water Treatment Plant signed in 2005. While some of these contracts were awarded through competitive bidding, most were awarded after direct negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Project Database: Russian Federation Snapshot|url=http://ppi.worldbank.org/explore/ppi_exploreCountry.aspx?countryId=91|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPI Database: Result of project search for water and Russia|url=http://ppi.worldbank.org/explore/Report.aspx|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Saint Petersburg utility signed a concession agreement for the Southwest wastewater treatment plant with a Swedish-Finnish consortium. The project was supported by loans from the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB). The [[Nordic Environment Finance Corporation]] owns part of the project company. The idea of a concession for the entire water and wastewater system of Saint Petersburg was first floated in 2005. In parallel, a plan to bid out a [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) contract for a water treatment plant was championed by the city governor [[Valentina Matvienko]], but was abandoned in 2013. In the same year, the new city governor [[Georgy Poltavchenko]] announced plans to sign a 25-30 year concession agreement including investments of USD 3 billion. A tender was expected to be launched in 2014 "at the earliest".

However, concessions such as the one planned for Saint Petersburg may not be financially viable because Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] imposed a national water tariff freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petersburg preps $3bn concession|url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/global-water-intelligence-magazine/14/12/general/petersburg-preps-3bn-concession|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|date=December 2013|subscription=yes|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 the city of Volgograd announced it would launch a bid for a 25-year concession involving investments of $500 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13018">'''William Saul Kroger''' (April 14, 1906 – December 4, 1995&lt;ref name="IJCEH obit"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Felice |first=Eugene A. |date=October 1996 |title=In Memoriam Dr. William S. Kroger (1906–1995) |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=287–289 | doi=10.1080/00207149608416091}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American [[medical doctor]] who pioneered the use of [[hypnosis]] in medicine and was co-founder and founder of medical societies and academies dedicated to furthering psychosomatic medicine and medical hypnosis.

Though he was trained as a gynecologist/obstetrician, his contributions to the medical field cut across disciplines and specialties in the medical field, including psychiatry, psychosomatic illness and treatment, endocrinology, neurobiology and bioengineering as well as his own specialty of gynecology and obstetrics.

He is the author of the medical textbook ''Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis'', considered to be a classic instructional aid in the use of hypnosis in medical settings, as well as co-authoring ''Psychosomatic Gynecology, Including Problems of Obstetrical Care'' and ''Hypnosis and Behavior Modification: Imagery Conditioning'', among others.

==Early life==
Kroger was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="remembering"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yapko |first=Michael D. |authorlink=Michael D. Yapko |date=July 2008 |title=The early days: remembering William S. Kroger, M.D. |journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=37–40 |doi=10.1080/00029157.2008.10401641 |pmid=18714890 |url=http://www.asch.net/portals/0/journallibrary/articles/ajch-51/51-1/yapko51-1.pdf |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroger's interest in [[hypnosis]] began at an early age when his father, Charles Mendel Kroger, hired a local hypnotist to generate publicity for his fur store. The hypnotist deeply hypnotized his assistant, then buried and awoke her. This inspired him to attempt to hypnotize other children in his neighborhood at age 13.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt;

==Education==
Kroger attended [[Northwestern University]] and received his [[pre-medical]] degree in 1926.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leaders"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1981 |title=Leaders in contemporary science: William S. Kroger, M.D. |journal=Journal of the American Society of Psychosomatic Dentistry and Medicine |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=35 |issn=0003-1194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his bachelor's degree, he joined a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] study club, which became the [[Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis]] and underwent his own analysis.

He received his medical training at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, obtaining his [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1930. He pursued his interest in psychotherapy by taking coursework and pursued an expertise in analytic concepts under the direction of Sigmund Freud's student and founder of [[psychosomatic medicine]], [[Franz Alexander]].&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

==Professional life==
Kroger demonstrated the use of hypnosis on a breast surgery procedure on [[closed-circuit television]] for a national meeting of [[anesthesiologist]]s in the removal of a benign growth and on another occasion in 1956 in Edgewater Hospital. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which was covering the latter meeting, wrote an article about Kroger's use of hypnosis.&lt;ref name="Medicine: Hypnosis for Surgery"&gt;{{cite news |title=Medicine: Hypnosis for Surgery |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 17, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867432,00.html |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week earlier, he had performed the same procedure on another patient in [[Chicago]] who suffered from an enlarged and overactive [[thyroid]]. Kroger carried out the "hypnoanesthesia" at Edgewater Hospital, where the patient's thyroid was removed in an hour-long operation. Following the surgery and after being de-hypnotized, the patient stood up from the gurney, asked for a sip of water and walked to her wheelchair to return to her room. She is quoted as saying, "I felt no pain. I could only feel pressure and what seemed like tugging at my throat."&lt;ref name="Medicine: Hypnosis for Surgery"/&gt;

The procedure was captured for the first time in the film ''Thyroidectomy Under Hypoanesthsia''. Kroger also participated in anesthetizing an expectant mother in ''Hypnosis in Obstetrics'', which was also the first occasion on which hypnotism's use in delivery was filmed. Both educational movies were intended as teaching aids at [[medical school]]s, [[hospital]]s and scientific meetings&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt; and were produced by Wexler Films (now out of business). The first film was rereleased and included on [[DVD]] with the second edition of ''Clinical &amp; Experimental Hypnosis''. The text, featuring an introduction by [[Michael D. Yapko]], is a republication of the second edition, originally printed in 1977; the first edition was published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kroger |first=William S. |date=2008 |origyear=1977 |title=Clinical and experimental hypnosis in medicine, dentistry, and psychology |edition=2nd |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] |isbn=9780781778022 |oclc=123962911 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced the medical film ''Hypnosis in Dentistry''.

An early member and co-founder of the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis (SCEH), a professional hypnosis society for researchers founded in 1949, Kroger later co-founded the [[American Society of Clinical Hypnosis]] with [[Milton H. Erickson]], which included clinicians into their ranks.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt; He was also founder of the Institute for Comprehensive Medicine and the International Society for Comprehensive Medicine, and the Academy of [[Psychosomatic Medicine]].&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

Kroger organized and conducted multiple-day teaching seminars at major medical schools and medical societies from 1950 to the 1980s.

The journal ''Psychosomatics'' was launched during his tenure as head of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, and he served as its associate editor. Kroger was also the associate editor of ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''; consulting editor of ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]''; advisory editor of the ''International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis''; associate editor of ''Existential Psychiatry'' and consulting editor of the ''Western Journal of Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology'' where he wrote a guest column entitled "Psychosomatics and Hypnosis".&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

His [[textbook]], ''Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis'', was described as being a "definitive textbook on the subject" and defined and shaped the field of hypnosis for over 20 years after its publication. Through the text and his own seminars put on by the ASCH, he changed the perception of hypnosis as being a novelty to a legitimate and respected medical option.&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

Kroger was a faculty member of the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine]] and also practiced privately.&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt; However, his use of hypnosis in medical practice was not accepted by the medical community.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt; He later became an associate professor at the [[Chicago Medical School]] in 1950. Later, he was involved in the establishment of the Psychosomatic Clinic at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center (Chicago)|Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago]] and became its first director. During this time he advanced his knowledge of endocrinology and [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]. The integration of his research and experience led to a collaboration with co-author S. Charles Freed in ''Psychosomatic Gynecology, Including Problems of Obstetrical Care'', a textbook which argued that hypnosis had a place and merit in the medical field. It was reviewed by many medical journals and praised as an authoritative work and an instant classic.&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

Kroger wrote 13 books and more than 200 journal articles, as well as contributing forewords and introductions to books on the subject of hypnosis.&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt; His scientific exhibits, Hypnotherapy in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Hypnotherapy in General Practice, have been held by the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Academy of General Practice]] (twice by invitation), the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and others.&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

==Involvement with law enforcement==
In 1979, Kroger wrote ''Hypnosis in Medical Investigation'' with Richard C. Douce. an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[special agent]] and psychology doctoral candidate. Kroger had been consulted on the use of hypnosis in ongoing investigations, and was asked by the FBI to evaluate the quality of information obtained through hypnosis in producing leads.&lt;ref name="Hypnosis in Criminal Investigation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kroger |first1=William S. |last2=Douce |first2=Richard G. |date=October 1979 |title=Hypnosis in criminal investigation |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=358–374 |doi=10.1080/00207147908407573 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207147908407573 |pmid=521191 |issn= 0020-7144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cases Kroger and Douce study in the article is the 1976 [[Chowchilla, California#1976 bus kidnapping|Chowchilla kidnapping]]. The FBI asked Kroger to question a school bus driver who was kidnapped along with 26 children.&lt;ref name="Hypnosis in Criminal Investigation"/&gt; Under Kroger's hypnosis, the driver was able to recall all but one of the digits on the kidnappers' car's license plate, and the kidnappers were subsequently convicted.&lt;ref name="Hypnosis in Criminal Investigation"/&gt;

Kroger taught and trained FBI agents in hypnosis techniques and assisted in more than 30 cases, sometimes in conjunction with the FBI's [[Behavioral Analysis Unit]]. He also consulted for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and other [[law enforcement]] agencies in the investigation of major crimes.&lt;ref name="Hypnosis in Criminal Investigation"/&gt;

==Private practice==
Kroger maintained a private practice in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and [[Palm Springs, California]] from 1960 until his retirement in 1986.

==Death==
Kroger died at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] on December 4, 1995.&lt;ref name="IJCEH obit" /&gt; He was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills]].&lt;ref name="Find A Grave"&gt;{{Find a Grave|19523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and journal articles==
Kroger authored 13 books which include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">'''World Milk Day''' is a day established by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]] to recognize the importance of [[milk]] as a global food.&lt;ref name="news-lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.lk/news/sri-lanka/item/7960-today-is-world-milk-day |title=Today is World Milk Day |access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed on June 1 each year since 2001.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/est/est-commodities/dairy/school-milk/15th-world-milk-day/en/ |title=World Milk Day: 1 June 2015|access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day is intended to provide an opportunity to bring attention to activities that are connected with the dairy sector.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

== History ==
World Milk Day was first designated by the FAO in 2001. June 1 was chosen as the date because many countries were already celebrating a milk day during that time of year.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

The Day provides an opportunity to focus attention on milk and raise awareness of dairy’s part in healthy diets, responsible food production, and supporting livelihoods and communities.  This is supported by FAO data showing that more than one billion people's livelihoods are supported by the dairy sector, and that dairy is consumed by more than six billion people globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2016_The_Dairy_Declaration_of_Rotterdam.html|title=The Dairy Declaration of Rotterdam|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many countries choose to do this on the same day lends additional importance to individual national celebrations and shows that milk is a global food.

In 2016, World Milk Day was celebrated in over 40 countries. Activities included marathons and family runs, milking demonstrations and farm visits, school-based activities, concerts, conferences and seminars, competitions and a range of events focusing on promoting the value of milk and illustrating the important role played by the dairy industry in the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/est/est-commodities/dairy/school-milk/15th-world-milk-day/en/|title=World Milk Day|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2017|website=Food and Agriculture Organisation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, there were 586 recorded World Milk Day events in 72 countries, and 1.1 billion impressions of #WorldMilkDay and #RaiseAGlass on social media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldmilkday.org/|title=World Milk Day - Home|website=worldmilkday.org|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This represented a four-fold increase in impressions over 2017.

Celebrations will happen again on June 1, 2019.

== Controversy ==
Despite overwhelming positive reaction to World Milk Day globally, some individuals attempt to promote their own anti-dairy agenda and misinformation such as "concerns about unfounded health claims of dairy, as well as recognition for the animal abuse in the dairy industry".  This includes the attempt to create a  "World Plant Milk Day"  on August 22,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldplantmilkday.com/|title=World Plant Milk Day - 22nd August 2017 - Celebrating the huge selection of plant based milks|website=www.worldplantmilkday.com|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is has the important distinction of being an unrecognized day by the FAO, or any official governing or policy-recommending body.   The movement is promoted by the use of the #WorldPlantMilkDay hashtag.
