{{Property law}}

'''Adverse possession''', sometimes colloquially described as '''"squatter's rights"''',{{efn|[[Squatting]] refers specifically to land ("[[real property]]"), and is by far the most common form of adverse possession.  Some jurisdictions have additional differences between "squatting" and adverse possession.}} is a legal principle that applies when a person who does not have [[title (property)|legal title]] to a piece of property{{mdash}}usually land ([[real property]]){{mdash}}attempts to claim legal ownership based upon a history of possession or occupation of the land without the permission of its legal owner.&lt;ref name="wex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse possession|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adverse_possession|website=Wex|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorized possessors through legal action such as [[ejectment]]. However, in the English [[common law]] tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property springs up in the adverse possessor.  In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2016|p=161}}{{efn|As described in the various "Requirements" sections, a number of conditions must be met in order for the adverse possessor to actually acquire title.}} Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as five years to as many as 40 years.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2016|p=170}}

Although the elements of an adverse possession action are different in every jurisdiction, a person claiming adverse possession is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Henry T.|title=Black's Law Dictionary, 5th ed|date=1979|publisher=West Publishing Co.|location=St. Paul|isbn=0829920455|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|'''Adverse possession''' is a method of acquiring complete title to land as against all others, including the record owner, through certain acts over an uninterrupted period of time, as prescribed by statute. Gifis, Steven H. (1984) Barron's Law Dictionary, page 14;  "An open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession for twenty years operates to convey a complete title...not only an interest in the land...but complete dominion over it." Sir William Blackstone (1759) Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume 2, page 418.}}

[[Personal property]], traditionally known as "chattel", may also be adversely possessed, but owing to the differences in the nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, and favor the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve [[work of art|works of art]].

==History==
{{see also|History of English land law}}
In [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Roman law]], ''[[usucapio]]'' laws allowed someone who was in possession of a good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner didn't show up after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the [[Napoleonic Code]], adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, adverse possession generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the [[bona fides]] of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] passed England's first general statute limiting the right to recover possession of land in 1623.{{sfnp|Merrill|1985|p=1128}} At [[common law]], if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a right to possession was not allowed to allege that the land had come into his possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been "put into seisin") at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognized a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute—first to the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], and then to the reign of [[Richard I]]. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient.  A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the limitation period in most common law jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

At traditional English common law, it was not possible to obtain title to property of [[the Crown]] by means of adverse possession.  This principle was embodied by the [[Latin language|Latin]] maxim ''[[nullum tempus occurrit regi]]'' ("no time runs against the king").  In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2016|p=174}}  Land with ''registered title'' in some [[Torrens title]] systems is also immune, for example, land that has been registered in the [[Hawaii Land Court]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HI Rev Stat § 501-87|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol12_Ch0501-0588/HRS0501/HRS_0501-0087.htm|website=Hawaii Revised Statutes|publisher=Hawaii State Legislature|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Fullard-Leo'', 66 F.Supp. 782 (D.C. Haw. 1944), ''affirmed'' 331 U.S. 256 (1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]] system of England and its historical colonies, local legislatures—such as [[Parliament]] in England or American state legislatures—generally create statutes of limitations that bar the owners from recovering the property after a certain number of years have passed.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2016|p=170}}

{{Clist adverse possession}}
{{main article|English land law|Land Registration Act 2002}}
Adverse possession is one of the most contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the [[middle ages]], those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.

A more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. [[Squatting in England]] has been a way for land to be efficiently [[utility|utilised]], particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the [[Land Registration Act 2002]], if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at [[common law]], the previous owner's right of action to eject the "adverse possessor" would expire. The common legal justification was that under the [[Limitation Act 1623]], just like a cause of action in [[English contract law|contract]] or [[English tort law|tort]] had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reform Committee, 21st Report, ''Final Report on Limitation of Actions'' (1977) Cmnd 6923, para 1.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of "possession" that was "adverse" were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. Different rules are in place for the limitation periods of adverse possession in unregistered land&lt;ref&gt;[[Limitation Act 1980]] ss 15 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and registered land.&lt;ref&gt;[[Land Registration Act 1925]] s 75 or [[Land Registration Act 2002]] Sch 6, depending on when the limitation period is completed.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] adverse possession of registered land became much harder.

===Land Registration Act 2002===
{{main article|Land Registration Act 2002}}
The rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under the [[LRA 2002]] Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor is entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;See generally JE Stake, 'The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession' (2000–2001) 89 Georgetown Law Journal 2419.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements===
Before the considerable hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the [[Limitation Act 1980]], the time when adverse possession began was when "possession" was taken. This had to be more than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Leigh v Jack]]'' (1879) 5 Ex D 264.&lt;/ref&gt; But "possession" did not require actual occupation. So in ''Powell v McFarlane'',&lt;ref&gt;(1979) 38 P&amp;CR 352.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held to be "possession" when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his [[cows]] roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an [[intention]] to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered "adverse" if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in ''BP Properties Ltd v Buckler'', Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life.&lt;ref&gt;(1988) 55 P&amp;CR 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, under the [[Limitation Act 1980]] sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.

===Human Rights challenges===
In ''[[JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham]]'', Mr and Mrs Graham had been let a part of Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planning permission]]. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under [[ECHR Protocol 1, article 1]] to "peaceful enjoyment of possessions".&lt;ref&gt;The point has been made by O Jones, ''Out with the Owners: The Eurasian Sequels to "J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom"'' (2008) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1688188 27 Civil Justice Quarterly 260–276], that adverse possession should be incapable of infringing the ECHR's concept of the right to property precisely because the person deprived has given up "possession".&lt;/ref&gt; The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules.&lt;ref&gt;[2008] 1 EHRLR 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fairweather v St Marylebone Property Co Ltd]]'' [1963] AC 510.&lt;/ref&gt; However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to prevent adverse possession.

===Timing===
For registered land, adverse possession claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the date the 2002 Act came into force)&lt;ref&gt;Section 1 The Land Registration Act 2002 (Transitional Provisions) (No 2) Order 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; are governed by section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act of 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on [[Trust law|trust]] for the adverse possessor.&lt;ref&gt;Section 75(1) Land Registration Act 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The adverse possessor can then apply to be the new registered proprietor of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Section 75(2) Land Registration Act 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

For registered land, adverse possession claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure. Where land is registered, the adverse possessor may henceforth apply to be registered as owner after 10 years&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 6 Paragraph 1 Land Registration Act 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; of adverse possession and the Land Registry must give notice to the true owner of this application.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 6 Paragraph 2 Land Registration Act 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the landowner a statutory period of time [65 business days] to object to the adverse possession, object to the application on the ground that there has not actually been the necessary 10 years’ adverse possession, and/or to serve a "counter-notice". If a counter-notice is served, then the application fails unless
* it would be unconscionable because of an equity by estoppel for the registered proprietor to seek to dispossess the squatter and the squatter ought in the circumstances to be registered as proprietor, or
* the squatter is for some other reason entitled to be registered as proprietor, or
* the squatter has been in adverse possession of land adjacent to their own under the mistaken but reasonable belief that they are the owner of it, the exact line of the boundary with this adjacent land has not been determined and the estate to which the application relates was registered more than a year prior to the date of the application.

Otherwise, the squatter becomes the registered proprietor according to the land registry. If the true owner is unable to evict the squatter in the two years following the first [unsuccessful] application, the squatter can apply again after this period and be successful despite the opposition of the owner. The process effectively prevents the removal of a landowner's [[right to property]] without his knowledge, while ensuring squatters have a fair way of exercising their rights.

Where a tenant adversely possesses land, there is a presumption that he is doing so in a way that will benefit his landlord at the end of his term. If the land does not belong to his landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]]. If the land does belong to his landlord, it would seem that it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of his term.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smirk v Lyndale Developments Ltd]]'' [1974] 3 WLR 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2012, squatting in a residential building is a criminal offence, but this does not prevent title being claimed by reason of adverse possession even if the claimant is committing a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Joseph (31 August 2012).

==United States==
[[File:Adverse possession US.pdf|thumb|400px|The Number of Years required for Adverse Possession in U.S. States]]

===Requirements===
The party seeking title by adverse possession may be called the ''[[disseisor]]'', meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse possession|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/adverse-possession|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the elements of an adverse possession claim may be different in a number of states, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, in a manner that is open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Adverse Possession|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/adverse_possession.html|accessdate=29 September 2017|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states impose additional requirements.  Many of the states have enacted statutes regulating the rules of adverse possession.&lt;ref name="ALTA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Analyzing Adverse Possession Laws and Cases of the States East of the Mississippi River|url=https://www.alta.org/news/news.cfm?20160301-Analyzing-Adverse-Possession-Laws-and-Cases-of-the-States-East-of-the-Mississippi-River|website=American Land Title Association|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states require a hostility requirement to secure adverse possession.  While most states take an objective approach to the hostility requirement, some states require a showing of good faith. Good faith means that claimants’ must demonstrate that they had some basis to believe that they actually owned the property at issue. Four states east of the Mississippi that require good faith in some form are Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="ALTA"/&gt;

====Actual possession====
The disseisor must physically use the land as a property owner would, in accordance with the type of property, location, and uses (merely walking or [[hunting]] on land does not establish actual possession).  The actions of the disseisor must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner.

In ''Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] held that Cone failed to establish actual possession by occasionally visiting the land and hunting on it, because his actions did not change the land from a wild and natural state.

====Hostile possession====
The disseisor must have entered or used the land without permission from the true owner. The disseisor's motivations may be interpreted by the court in several ways, depending upon state law and precedent:
*Objective view – the land was used without true owner's permission and in a manner inconsistent with true owner's rights;
*Bad faith or intentional trespass view – the land was used with the adverse possessor's subjective intent to disregard or violate the actual property owner's rights; 
*Good faith view – a few states require that the party claiming adverse possession must have mistakenly believed that it is his land.
Some jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession, as might occur as the result of a [[surveying]] error that places the boundary line between properties in the wrong location.

Renters, hunters or others who enter the land with permission are not taking possession that is hostile to the title owner's rights. (mistaken possession in some jurisdictions does not constitute hostility)

====Open and notorious use====
The disseisor must possess the property in a manner that is capable of being seen. That is, the disseisor's use of the property must be sufficiently visible and apparent that it gives notice to the legal owner that someone may assert claim, and must be of such character that would give notice to a reasonable person.  If legal owner has actual knowledge of the use, this element is met; it can be also met by fencing, opening or closing gates or an entry to the property, posted signs, crops, buildings, or animals that a diligent owner could be expected to know about.

====Continuous use====
The disseisor claiming adverse possession must hold that property '''continuously''' for the entire [[statute of limitations]] period, and use it as a true owner would for that time.

Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile possession must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, but breaks in use that are consistent with how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If at any time during the statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.

The statute of limitations applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another disseisor who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, it may be possible for the second disseisor to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as ''tacking''.

====Exclusive use====
The disseisor holds the land to the exclusion of the true owner. There may be more than one adverse possessor, taking as [[tenants in common]], so long as the other elements are met.  But adverse possession cannot be successfully claimed if, any time during the statutory period, the true owner uses the land for any reason.

====Additional requirements====
In addition to the basic elements of an adverse possession case, state law may require one or more additional elements to be proved by a person claiming adverse possession. Depending upon the state, additional requirements may include:

*[[Color of title]], claim of title, or claim of right. Color of title and claim of title involve a legal document that appears (incorrectly) to give the disseisor title.&lt;ref name="ccp323"&gt;{{cite web|title=California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 323|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&amp;sectionNum=323.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions the mere intent to take the land as one's own may constitute "claim of right", with no documentation required.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Other cases have determined that a claim of right exists if the person believes he has rightful claim to the property, even if that belief is mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=North American Oil Consol. v. Burnet, 286 US 417 (1932)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8752680588624533229|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative example would be a timber thief who sneaks onto a property, cuts [[timber]] not visible from the road, and hauls the logs away at night. His actions, though they demonstrate actual possession, also demonstrate knowledge of guilt, as opposed to claim of right.
*Good faith (in a minority of states) or bad faith (sometimes called the "Maine Doctrine" although it is now abolished in [[Maine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dombkowski v. Ferland, 2006 ME 24, 893 A.2d 599 (2006)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16400095992802892129|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disseisor will be committing a civil [[trespass]] on the property he has taken and the owner of the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass ("ejectment") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have [[acquiescence|acquiesced]]. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the [[jurisdiction]], but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.

In 2008, due to the volume of adverse possession and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mavidis|first=Andriana|date=Summer 2011|title=Retrospective Application of the 2008 Amendments to New York's Adverse Possession Laws|url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/lawreview/vol85/iss3/4|journal=St. John's Law Review|volume=85|issue=3|pages=1057–1103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner’s rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayshore Gardens Owners, Inc. v Meersand 2008 NY Slip Op 51770(U) [20 Misc 3d 1137(A)] Decided on August 18, 2008|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11505688395992666138|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately eight (8) years after the 2008 amendment, on June 30, 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of adverse possession where title had vested prior to 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-first-department/2016/1627-601279-08.html|title=Hudson Sq.

''Hudson Square Hotel'' also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the [[air rights]] are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) "where" (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) "what" property rights are acquired as a result of title to the ground [[Floor area (building)|floor area]] (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff.  In ''Hudson Square Hotel'' the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building.  This argument was motivated, in part, by the fact that the [[zoning laws]] at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six (6) times the square footage of the ground floor area.  For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of buildable square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession.  The Court clarified, "It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land.  The Court also held, "With title to land come air rights."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land.

In other jurisdictions, the disseisor acquires merely an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] title; the landowner is considered to be a [[trustee]] of the property for the disseisor.

Adverse possession extends only to the property actually possessed. If the original owner had a title to a greater area (or volume) of property, the disseisor does not obtain all of it. The exception to this is when the disseisor enters the land under a [[color of title]] to an entire parcel, his continuous and actual possession of a small part of that parcel will perfect his title to the entire parcel defined in his color of title.  Thus a disseisor need not build a dwelling on, or farm on, every portion of a large tract in order to prove possession, as long as his title does correctly describe the entire parcel.

In some jurisdictions, a person who has successfully obtained title to property by adverse possession may (optionally) bring an action in [[land court]] to "[[quiet title]]" of record in his name on some or all of the former owner's property.  Such action will make it simpler to convey the interest to others in a definitive manner, and also serves as notice that there is a new ''owner of record'', which may be a prerequisite to benefits such as equity loans or judicial standing as an [[abutter]].  Even if such action is not taken, the title is legally considered to belong to the new titleholder, with most of the benefits and duties, including paying [[property tax]]es to avoid losing title to the tax collector.  The effects of having a stranger to the title paying taxes on property may vary from one jurisdiction to another. (Many jurisdictions have accepted tax payment for the same parcel from two different parties without raising an objection or notifying either party that the other had also paid.)

Adverse possession does not typically work against property owned by the public.

The process of adverse possession would require a thorough analysis if private property is taken by [[eminent domain]], after which control is given to a private corporation (such as a [[railroad]]), and then abandoned.

Where land is registered under a [[Torrens title]] registration system or similar, special rules apply. It may be that the land cannot be affected by adverse possession (as was the case in [[England and Wales]] from 1875 to 1926, and as is still the case in the state of Minnesota&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160325101902/https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=508.02 Minn. Stat. 508.02].&lt;/ref&gt;) or that special rules apply.

Adverse possession may also apply to territorial rights. In the United States, Georgia lost an island in the Savannah River to South Carolina in 1990, when South Carolina had used [[fill (land)|fill]] from [[dredging]] to attach the island to its own shore. Since Georgia knew of this yet did nothing about it, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] (which has [[original jurisdiction]] in such matters) [[Georgia v. South Carolina|granted this land]] to South Carolina, although the [[Treaty of Beaufort]] (1787) explicitly specified that the river's islands belonged to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 U.S. 376 (1990) see [[Georgia v. South Carolina]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squatter's rights==
Most cases of adverse possession deal with boundary line disputes between two parties who hold clear title to their property. The term "squatter's rights" has no precise and fixed legal meaning. In some jurisdictions the term refers to temporary rights available to squatters that prevent them, in some circumstances, from being removed from property without due process. For example, in [[England and Wales]] reference is usually to [[Criminal Law Act 1977#Section 6 - Violence for securing entry|section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977]]. In the United States, no ownership rights are created by mere possession, and a squatter may only take possession through adverse possession if the squatter can prove all elements of an adverse possession claim for the jurisdiction in which the property is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Estrin|first1=Michael|title=Adverse possession: Can you squat to own?|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/adverse-possession-squat-to-own.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2017|agency=BankRate|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any adverse possession claim, if a squatter abandons the property for a period, or if the rightful owner effectively removes the squatter's access even temporarily during the statutory period, or gives his permission, the "clock" usually stops.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} For example, if the required period in a given jurisdiction is twenty years and the squatter is removed after only 15 years, the squatter loses the benefit of that 15-year possession (i.e., the clock is reset at zero). If that squatter later retakes possession of the property, that squatter must, to acquire title, remain on the property for a full 20 years after the date on which the squatter retook possession. In this example, the squatter would have held the property for a total of 35 years (the original 15 years plus the later 20 years) to acquire title.

Depending on the jurisdiction, one squatter may or may not pass along continuous possession to another squatter, known as "tacking". Tacking is defined as "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;TACKING, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and Privity of Estate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of the three types of privity is required in order for one adverse possessor to "tack" their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating "color of title."  A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary "continuous and hostile" element.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.

===England and Wales===

'[[Squatting]]' became a criminal offence in England/Wales under Section 144 of the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/144/enacted|title=Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section also inserted an immediate power of entry to the premises into Section 17 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].

===United States===
In the United States, the concept of squatter's rights are generally used to refer to a specific form of adverse possession where the disseisor holds no title to any properties adjoining the property under dispute.  In most jurisdictions of the United States, few [[squatters]] can meet the legal requirements for adverse possession.  &lt;!--Generally, in the UK, it is much easier for a non-landholding squatter to claim land than in the US, although laws vary state to state. --&gt;

==Comparison to homesteading==
Adverse possession is in some ways similar to [[homestead principle|homesteading]].  Like the disseisor, the homesteader may gain title to property by using the land and fulfilling certain other conditions. In homesteading, however, the possession of the property is not hostile; the land is either considered to have no legal owner or is owned by the government. The government allows the homesteader to use the land with the expectation that the homesteader who fulfills the requirements necessary for the homestead will gain title to the property.

The principles of homesteading and squatter's rights embody the most basic concept of property and ownership, which can be summarized by the adage "[[wikt:possession is nine-tenths of the law|possession is nine-tenths of the law]]," meaning the person who uses the property effectively owns it. Likewise, the adage, "use it or lose it," applies. The principles of homesteading and squatter's rights predate formal property laws; to a large degree, modern property law formalizes and expands these simple ideas.

The principle of homesteading is that if no one is using or possessing property, the first person to claim it and use it consistently over a specified period owns the property.  Squatter's rights embodies the idea that if one property owner neglects property and fails to use it, and a second person starts to tend and use the property, then after a certain period the first person's claim to the property is lost and ownership transfers to the second person, who is actually using the property.

The legal principle of homesteading, then, is a formalization of the [[homestead principle]] in the same way that the right of adverse possession is a formalization of the pre-existing principle of squatter's rights.

The essential ideas behind the principles of homesteading and squatter's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or possession.  In modern law, homesteading and the right of adverse possession refer exclusively to [[real property]].  In the realm of [[personal property]], the same impulse is summarized by the adage "finders/keepers" and is formalized by laws and conventions concerning [[abandoned property]].

==Copyrights==
Some legal scholars have proposed the extension of the concept of adverse possession to [[intellectual property law]], in particular to reconcile intellectual property and [[antitrust law]]&lt;ref&gt;Constance E. Bagley and Gavin Clarkson, "Adverse Possession for Intellectual Property: Adapting an Ancient Concept to Resolve Conflicts between Antitrust and Intellectual Property Laws in the Information Age" ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology'' '''16''':2 (Spring 2003) [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v16/16HarvJLTech327.pdf full text].&lt;/ref&gt; or to unify copyright law and property law.&lt;ref&gt;Michael James Arrett, "Adverse Possession of Copyright: A Proposal to Complete Copyright's Unification with Property Law", ''Journal of Corporation Law'' '''31''':1 (October 2005) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jcorl31&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals abstract; full text (pay)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse possession of easements==
Some jurisdictions merge the concept of adverse possession with that of [[Easement#Easement by prescription|prescription]], so that adverse possession may be used to gain various incorporeal rights to land as well as land itself.

Under this theory, adverse possession grants only those rights in the disseized property that are 'taken' by the disseisor. For example, a disseisor might choose to take an [[easement]] rather than the entire [[fee title]] to the property. In this manner, it is possible to disseize an easement, under the legal doctrine of [[Easement#Easement by prescription|prescription]]. This must also be done openly but need not be exclusive. Prescription is governed by different statutory and common law time limits to adverse possession. It is common practice in cities such as New York, where builders often leave sidewalk space or plazas in front of their buildings to meet [[zoning]] requirements, to close public areas they own periodically to prevent the creation of a permanent easement that would cloud their exclusive [[property rights]].  For the same reason, city sidewalks may have embedded markers along the property line around a plaza or open area announcing "This Space Not Dedicated" to indicate that although the public may use the space within the markers, it is still private property.

If a property owner interferes with an easement upon his property in a manner that satisfies the requirements for adverse prescription (e.g. locking the gates to a commonly used area, and nobody does anything about it), he will successfully extinguish the easement.  This is another reason to quiet title after a successful adverse possession or adverse prescription: it clarifies the record of who should take action to preserve the adverse title or easement while evidence is still fresh.

For example, given a deeded easement to use someone else's driveway to reach a garage, if a fence or permanently locked gate prevents the use, nothing is done to remove and circumvent the obstacle, and the statutory period expires, then the easement ceases to have any legal force, although the deed held by the fee-simple owner stated that the owner's interest was subject to the easement.

Strictly speaking, prescription works in a different way to adverse possession. Adverse possession is concerned with the extinction of the title of the original owner by a rule of limitation of actions. Prescription, on the other hand, is concerned with acquiring a right that did not previously exist.

In the law of [[England and Wales]] adverse possession and prescription are treated as being entirely different doctrines. The former being entirely statutory deriving from the [[Limitation Act 1980]], the latter being possible under purely common law principles.

==Non-common law jurisdictions==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
Some non-common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, [[Louisiana]] has a legal doctrine called [[Prescription (sovereignty transfer)|acquisitive prescription]], which is derived from [[French law]].

==Theory==
Adverse possession exists to cure potential or actual defects in real estate titles by putting a statute of limitations on possible litigation over ownership and possession. Because of the doctrine of adverse possession, a landowner can be secure in title to his land.  Otherwise, long-lost heirs of any former owner, possessor or [[lien]] holder of centuries past could come forward with a legal claim on the property. The doctrine of adverse possession prevents this. This means the law may be used to reward a person who possesses the land of another for a requisite period of time. Failure of a landowner to exercise and defend his property rights for a certain period may result in the permanent loss of the landowner's interest in the property. In economic terms, adverse possession encourages and rewards productive use of land.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''Albertson conjecture''' is an unproven relationship between the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]] and the [[chromatic number]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. It is named after Michael O. Albertson, a professor at [[Smith College]], who stated it as a conjecture in 2007;&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Albertson|Cranston|Fox|2009}}, the conjecture was made by Albertson at a special session of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in Chicago, held in October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of his many conjectures in [[graph coloring]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In memory of Michael O. Albertson, 1946–2009: a collection of his outstanding conjectures and questions in graph theory|first=Joan P.|last=Hutchinson|authorlink=Joan Hutchinson|date=June 19, 2009|url=http://orion.math.iastate.edu/rymartin/dm-net/MOASIAM.pdf|publisher=SIAM Activity group on Discrete Mathematics}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture states that, among all graphs requiring ''n'' colors, the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the one with the smallest crossing number.
Equivalently, if a graph can be drawn with fewer crossings than ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then, according to the conjecture, it may be colored with fewer than ''n'' colors.

==A conjectured formula for the minimum crossing number==
It is straightforward to show that graphs with bounded crossing number have bounded chromatic number: one may assign distinct colors to the endpoints of all crossing edges and then 4-color the remaining [[planar graph]]. Albertson's conjecture replaces this qualitative relationship between crossing number and coloring by a more precise quantitative relationship. Specifically,
a different conjecture of {{harvs|first=Richard K.|last=Guy|authorlink=Richard K. Guy|year=1972|txt}} states that the crossing number of the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{cr}(K_n)=\frac14\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor\left\lfloor\frac{n-2}{2}\right\rfloor\left\lfloor\frac{n-3}{2}\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;
It is known how to draw complete graphs with this many crossings, by placing the vertices in two concentric circles; what is unknown is whether there exists a better drawing with fewer crossings. Therefore, a strengthened formulation of the Albertson conjecture is that every ''n''-chromatic graph has crossing number at least as large as the right hand side of this formula.&lt;ref name="acf09"&gt;{{harvtxt|Albertson|Cranston|Fox|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This strengthened conjecture would be true if and only if both Guy's conjecture and the Albertson conjecture are true.

==Asymptotic bounds==
A weaker form of the conjecture, proven by M. Schaefer,&lt;ref name="acf09"/&gt; states that every graph with chromatic number ''n'' has crossing number &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), or equivalently that every graph with crossing number ''k'' has chromatic number ''O''(''k''&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;). {{harvtxt|Albertson|Cranston|Fox|2009}} published a simple proof of these bounds, by combining the fact that every minimal ''n''-chromatic graph has minimum degree at least&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (else one could (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-color it by removing a low-degree vertex, coloring the remaining graph, and use any available color for the removed vertex) together with the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number inequality]] according to which every graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',''E'') with |''E''|/|''V''|&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4 has crossing number &amp;Omega;(|''E''|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/|''V''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Using the same reasoning, they show that a counterexample to Albertson's conjecture for the chromatic number ''n'' (if it exists) must have fewer than 4''n'' vertices.

==Special cases==
The Albertson conjecture is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has crossing number zero, and all graphs have crossing number greater than or equal to zero. The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 of Albertson's conjecture is equivalent to the [[four color theorem]], that any planar graph can be colored with four or fewer colors, for the only graphs requiring fewer crossings than the one crossing of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are the planar graphs, and the conjecture implies that these should all be at most 4-chromatic. Through the efforts of several groups of authors the conjecture is now known to hold for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ackerman|2013}}; {{harvtxt|Oporowski|Zhao|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Albertson|Cranston|Fox|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Barát|Tóth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For every integer c&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;6, Luiz and Richter presented a family of ''(c+1)''-colour-critical graphs that do not contain a subdivision of the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(c+1)&lt;/sub&gt; but have crossing number at least that of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(c+1)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Luiz|Richter|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related conjectures==
There is also a connection to the [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]], an important open problem in combinatorics concerning the relationship between chromatic number and the existence of large [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] as [[graph minor|minors]] in a graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barát|Tóth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of the Hadwiger conjecture, stated by [[György Hajós]], is that every ''n''-chromatic graph contains a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; if this were true, the Albertson conjecture would follow, because the crossing number of the whole graph is at least as large as the crossing number of any of its subdivisions. However, counterexamples to the Hajós conjecture are now known,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Catlin|1979}}; {{harvtxt|Erdős|Fajtlowicz|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so this connection does not provide an avenue for proof of the Albertson conjecture.

'''Anguillan Creole''' is a dialect of [[Leeward Caribbean Creole English]] spoken in [[Anguilla]], an island and [[British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean]]. Although classified as a dialect of Leeward Caribbean Creole English spoken in Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Montserrat due to a common British colonial history, it is actually closer to the [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Saint Martin]] varieties of [[Virgin Islands Creole]].  The number of speakers of Anguillan Creole is below 10,000. Anguillan Creole does not have the status of an official language.

{{Grammatical categories}}
'''Animacy''' (antonym: '''inanimacy''') is a [[Grammatical category|grammatical]] and [[semantic]] feature, existing in some languages, expressing how [[sentient]] or [[life|alive]] the referent of a [[noun]] is. Widely expressed, animacy is one of the most elementary principles in languages around the globe, and is a distinction acquired as early as six months of age.&lt;ref name=Szewczyk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szewczyk|first=Jakub M.|author2=Herbert Schriefers|title=Is animacy special? ERP correlates of semantic violations and animacy violations in sentence processing|journal=Brain Research|date=2010|volume=1368|pages=208–221|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.070|pmid=21029726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of animacy constantly vary beyond a simple animate and inanimate binary; many languages function off of a [[implicational hierarchy|hierarchical]] General Animacy Scale that ranks animacy as a "matter of gradience."&lt;ref name=Yamamoto&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamamoto|first=Mutsumi|title=Agency and impersonality: Their linguistic and cultural manifestations|date=2006|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically (with some variation of order and of where the cutoff for animacy occurs), the scale ranks humans above animals, then plants, natural forces, concrete objects, and abstract objects, in that order. In referring to humans, this scale contains a hierarchy of persons, ranking the first and second person [[pronoun]]s above the third person, partly a product of empathy, involving the speaker and [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="Yamamoto" /&gt; Additionally, the hierarchy tends to place singular persons over plural (as seen in the heavy difference between "I regret to inform you" and "We regret to inform you"),{{clarification|date=August 2018}} but it carries exceptions, such as thousands of people signing a petition.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto" /&gt;

==Examples==
The distinction between ''he'', ''she'', and [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|other personal pronouns]], on one hand, and ''it'', on the other hand is a distinction in animacy in [[English language|English]] and in many [[Indo-European languages]]. The same can be said about distinction between ''who'' and ''what''. Some languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Spoken Finnish]] do not distinguish between ''s/he'' and ''it''. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], there is a distinction in animacy between ''[[wikt:hän#Finnish|hän]]'' "he/she" and ''[[wikt:se#Finnish|se]]'' "it", but in [[Spoken Finnish]], ''se'' can mean "he/she". English shows a similar lack of distinction between ''they'' animate and ''they'' inanimate in the plural but, as shown above, it has such a distinction in the singular.

There is another example of how animacy plays some role in English. For example, the higher animacy a referent has, the less preferable it is to use the preposition ''of'' for possession (that can also be interpreted in terms of alienable or [[inalienable possession]]):
* ''My face'' is correct while &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''the face of me'' would sound very strange.
* ''The man's face'' and ''the face of the man'' are both correct, but the former is preferred.
* ''The clock's face'' and ''the face of the clock'' are both correct, but the latter is preferred.

Examples of languages in which an animacy hierarchy is important include the [[Totonac language]] in [[Mexico]] and the [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] (such as [[Western Apache]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]) whose animacy hierarchy has been the subject of intense study. The [[Tamil language]] has a [[grammatical gender|noun classification]] based on animacy.

===Proto-Indo-European language===
Because of the similarities in morphology of feminine and masculine [[grammatical gender#Masculine, feminine, and neuter|grammatical gender]] inflections in [[Indo-European languages]], there is a theory that in an early stage, the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] had only two grammatical genders: "[[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|animate]]" and "[[Grammatical gender#Common and neuter|inanimate/neuter]]"; the most obvious difference being that inanimate/neuter nouns used the same form for the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] [[noun case]]s. The distinction was preserved in [[Anatolian languages]] like [[Hittite language|Hittite]], all of which are now extinct.

The animate gender would then later, after the separation of the Anatolian languages, have developed into the feminine and masculine genders. The plural of neuter/inanimate nouns is believed to have had the same ending as [[collective noun]]s in the singular, and some words with the collective noun ending in singular were later to become words with the feminine gender. Traces can be found in [[Ancient Greek]] in which the singular form of verbs was used when they referred to neuter words in plural. In many Indo-European languages, such as [[Latin]] and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic languages]], the plural ending of many neuter words in the merged nominative–accusative–vocative corresponds to the feminine singular nominative form.

===Navajo===
Like most other [[Athabaskan languages]], [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] show various levels of animacy in their grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young &amp; Morgan 1987: 65-66):

Human &gt; Infant/Big Animal &gt; Medium-sized Animal &gt; Small Animal &gt; Natural Force &gt; Abstraction

Generally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, either noun can occur in the first position. Both sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The ''yi-'' prefix on the verb indicates that the first noun is the subject and ''bi-'' indicates that the second noun is the subject.

{|
| (1) 
| '''Ashkii'''
| '''at’ééd'''
| '''yiníł’į́'''
|-
|
| boy
| girl
| ''yi''-look
|-
|
| colspan="3"|'The boy is looking at the girl.'
|}

{|
| (2) 
| '''At’ééd'''
| '''ashkii'''
| '''biníł’į́'''
|-
|
| girl
| boy
| ''bi''-look
|-
|
| colspan="3"|'The girl is being looked at by the boy.'
|}

Sentence (3), however, sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:

{|
| (3) 
| '''*Tsídii'''
| '''at’ééd'''
| '''yishtąsh'''
|-
|
| bird
| girl
| ''yi''-pecked
|-
|
| colspan="3"|*'The bird pecked the girl.'
|}

In order to express that idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):

{|
| (4) 
| '''At’ééd'''
| '''tsídii'''
| '''bishtąsh'''
|-
|
| girl
| bird
| ''bi''-pecked
|-
|
| colspan="3"|'The girl was pecked by the bird.'
|}

There is evidence suggesting that the word order, per se, is not the important factor.  Instead, the verb construction usually interpreted as the passive voice (eg. "the girl was pecked by the bird") instead indicates that the more animate noun allowed the less animate noun to perform the action (eg. "the girl let herself be pecked by the bird").  The idea is that things ranked higher in animacy are presumed to be in control of the situation, and that the less-animate thing can only act if the more-animate thing permits it.

===Japanese===
Although nouns in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are not marked for animacy, it has two [[copula (linguistics)|existential]]/[[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] verbs; one for implicitly animate nouns (usually humans and animals) and one for implicitly inanimate nouns (often nonliving objects and plants). The verb ''iru'' (いる, also written 居る) is used to show the existence or possession of an animate noun. The verb ''aru'' (ある, sometimes written 在る when existential or 有る when possessive) is used to show the existence or possession of an inanimate noun.

An animate noun, there 'cat,' is marked as the subject of the verb with the subject particle ''ga'' (が), but no [[topic-prominent language|topic]] or location is marked. That implies the noun is indefinite and merely exists.

{|
|- align=center

|
| 猫
| が
| いる
|- align=center
|

| SUBJECT
| to exist
|- align=left 
|
| colspan="3"|'There is a cat.'
|}

In the second example, a topic is introduced, in this case "I", with the topic particle ''wa'' (は). The animate noun is again marked with a subject particle, and no location is denoted. That implies that the topic owns or is holding onto the noun.

{|
|- align=center

|- align=center
|
|I
|LOC
|TOPIC
| cat
| SUBJECT
| to exist
|- align=left 
|
| colspan="3"|'I have a cat.'
|}

In the third example, the noun is marked as the topic (and by default functions as the subject of the verb) while a location, there the top of a chair, is marked with the location particle ''ni'' (に). That implies that the noun is a definite noun and is at the specified location.

{|
|- align=center

|
| colspan="3"|'The cat is on the chair.'
|}

In all those cases, if the noun is not animate, such as a stone, instead of a cat, the verb ''iru'' must be replaced with the verb ''aru'' (ある or 有る[possessive]/在る[existential,locative]).
{|

|}

In some cases in which 'natural' animacy is ambiguous, whether a noun is animate or not is the decision of the speaker, as in the case of a [[robot]], which could be correlated with the animate verb (to signify [[sentience]] or [[anthropomorphism]]) or with the inanimate verb (to emphasise that is a nonliving thing).

====Ryukyuan languages==== 
The [[Ryukyuan languages]], spoken in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] agree in animacy in their case systems.&lt;ref&gt;
Shimoji, Michinori; Pellard, Thomas, eds. (2010). An Introduction to Ryukyuan languages. Tokyo: ILCAA. {{ISBN|9784863370722}}. Retrieved August 21, 2012.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
====Overview====
[[Russian language|Russian]] has a somewhat complex hierarchy of animacy in which syntactically animate nouns may include both animate and inanimate objects (like mushrooms and dances).&lt;ref name=Frarie&gt;{{cite book|last=Frarie|first=Susan E.|title=Animacy in Czech and Russian|date=1992|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the border between animate and inanimate places humans and animals in the former and plants, etc., in the latter, thus basing itself more so on sentience than life.&lt;ref name="Frarie" /&gt;

Animacy functions as a subgender through which noun cases intersect in a phenomenon called [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]], which here can be either [[grammatical case|nominative-accusative or genitive-accusative]]. Inanimate nouns have accusative forms that take on the same forms as their nominative, with animate nouns marked by having their genitive forms resemble the nominative.&lt;ref name=Klenin&gt;{{cite book|last=Klenin|first=Emily|title=Animacy in Russian: a new interpretation|date=1983|publisher=Slavica Publishers|location=Columbus, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, syncretism conditioned by referential animacy results in forms like the following:

* NOM ''stol'' ‘table’ -&gt; ACC stol, like nom (exhibiting nom-acc syncretism);
* NOM ''kot'' ‘cat’ -&gt; ACC kota, like gen (exhibiting gen-acc syncretism).&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt;

That syncretism also occurs when restricted by declension class, resulting in syncretism in multiple [[Pronoun|pronominal forms]], such as the reflexive pronoun ''sebja'', personal pronouns, and the indefinite interrogative and relative pronoun ''kto''.&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt;

In their plural forms, nouns of all genders may distinguish the categories of animate vs. inanimate by that syncretism, but only masculine nouns of the first declension (and their modifiers) show it in the singular (Frarie 1992:12), and other declensions and genders of nouns "restrict (morphological) expression of animacy to the plural" (Frarie 1992:47).
* Masc nouns that show '''acc-gen''' (sg &amp; plural) syncretism: муж [muʂ] husband, сын [sɨn] son, лев [lʲef] lion, конь [konʲ] horse.&lt;ref name="Frarie" /&gt;
* Fem animate nouns that show '''acc-gen''' (plural) syncretism: женщина [ˈʐɛnʲɕːɪnə] woman, лошадь [ˈɫoʂətʲ] horse.&lt;ref name="Frarie" /&gt;
* Neut animate nouns that show '''acc-nom''' (sg) and '''acc-gen''' (plural) syncretism: [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/животное#Russian животное] 'animal', [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/насекомое#Russian насекомое] 'insect'.
Elsewhere, animacy is displayed syntactically, such as in endings of modifiers for masc nouns of the second declension.&lt;ref name="Frarie" /&gt;

====Animacy as a "subgender"====
While animacy is viewed as primarily semantic when approached diachronically, a synchronic view suggests animacy as a sublevel of gender.&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt; Syntactic gender is defined through patterns in agreement, not necessarily semantic value.&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt; For example, Russian has "common gender" nouns that refer to traditionally masculine roles but act as syntactically feminine.&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt;

Animacy occurs as a subgender of nouns and modifiers (and pronouns only when adjectival) and is primarily reflected in modifier-head agreement (as opposed to subject-predicate agreement).

====Controversy====
Some consider the system to be based on marking inanimacy in which case the gen-acc distinguishes a "non-inanimate" subgender of nouns and modifiers,&lt;ref name="Klenin" /&gt; and others claim that ultimately it is indeed animacy that is marked.&lt;ref name="Frarie" /&gt;

===Sinhala===
In spoken [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], there are two [[copula (linguistics)|existential]]/[[possessive (linguistics)|possessive verbs]]: හිටිනවා ''hiţinawā'' / ඉන්නවා ''innawā'' are used only for animate nouns (humans and animals), and තියෙනවා ''tiyenawā'' for inanimate nouns (like nonliving objects, plants, things):

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the preposition ''a'' (meaning "to" or "at") has gained a second role as a marker of concrete animate direct objects:
{|
| ''Veo esa catedral.''
| "I can see that cathedral."
| (inanimate direct object)
|- 
| ''Veo a esa persona'' 
| "I can see that person."
| (animate direct object)
|-
| ''Vengo a España.''
| "I come to Spain."
| (''a'' used in its literal sense)
|}

The usage is standard and is found around the Spanish-speaking world.

====Pronouns====
Spanish personal pronouns are generally omitted if the subject of the sentence, but when they are explicitly stated, they are used only with people or [[humanized animals]] or things. The inanimate subject pronoun in Spanish is ''ello'', like ''it'' in English.

Spanish direct object pronouns (''me, te, lo, la, se, nos, os, los, las'') do not differentiate between animate and inanimate entities, and only the third persons have a gender distinction. Thus, for example, the third person singular feminine pronoun, ''la'', could refer to a woman, an animal (like ''mariposa'', butterfly), or an object (like ''casa'', house), if their genders are feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Diccionario panhispánico de dudas |year=2005 |publisher=Santillana Ediciones Generales |location=Bogotá |isbn=958-704-368-5 | author=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With pronouns, there is a tendency to use ''le'' (which is usually an indirect object pronoun, meaning "to him/her") as a direct-object pronoun, at the expense of the direct-object pronouns ''lo/la'', if the referent is animate. That tendency is especially strong if (a) the pronoun is being used as a special second-person pronoun of respect, (b) the referent is male, (c) certain verbs are used, (d) the subject of the verb happens to be inanimate.  There is great regional variation as regards that usage.

===Arabic===
In [[Classical Arabic|Classical]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and some other [[varieties of Arabic]], animacy has a limited application in the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of plural and [[dual form|dual]] nouns with verbs and adjectives. Verbs follow nouns in plural agreement only when the verb comes after the subject. When a verb comes before an explicit subject, the verb is always singular. Also, only animate plural and dual nouns take plural agreement; inanimate plural and dual nouns are always analyzed as singular feminine for the purpose of agreement. Thus, Arabic {{lang|ar|المهندسون يطيرون إلى ألمانيا}} (''Al-muhandisūn yuṭīrūn 'ilā 'Almāniyā'', "The engineers fly to [[Germany]]") is masculine plural agreement, but {{lang|ar|الطائرات تطير إلى ألمانيا}} (''Al-ṭā'irāt tuṭīr 'ilā 'Almāniyā'', "The planes fly to Germany") is feminine singular. Compare them to {{lang|ar|تطير المهندسات إلى ألمانيا}} (''Tuṭīr al-muhandisat 'ilā 'Almāniyā'') and {{lang|ar|المهندسات يطرن إلى ألمانيا}} (''Al-muhandisāt yuṭīrna 'ilā 'Almāniyā'') for "The [female] engineers fly to Germany."

In general, Arabic divides animacy between {{lang|ar|عاقل}} (thinking, or rational) and {{lang|ar|غير عاقل}} (unthinking, or irrational). Animals fall in the latter category, but their status may change depending on the usage, especially with personification. Different writers might use {{lang|ar|الغربان يطيرون إلى ألمانيا}} (''Al-ghurbān yuṭīrūn 'ilā 'Almāniyā'') or {{lang|ar|الغربان تطير إلى ألمانيا}} (''Al-ghurbān tuṭīr 'ilā 'Almāniyā'') for "The ravens fly to Germany."

==Animacy hierarchy and morphosyntactic alignment==

===Split ergativity===
Animacy can also condition the nature of the morphologies of [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] languages. In such languages, participants more animate are more likely to be the [[theta role|agent]] of the verb, and therefore are marked in an accusative pattern: unmarked in the agent role and marked in the patient or oblique role.

Likewise, less animate participants are inherently more patient-like, and take ergative marking: unmarked when in the patient role and marked when in the agent role. The hierarchy of animacy generally, but not always, is ordered:
{| 
| ''1st person''
| &gt; || ''2nd person''
| &gt; || ''3rd person''
| &gt; || ''proper names''
| &gt; || ''humans''
| &gt; || {{unbulleted list|''non-humans''|''animates''}}
| &gt; || ''inanimates''
|}
The location of the split (the line which divides the inherently agentive participants from the inherently patientive participants) varies from language to language, and, in many cases, the two classes overlap, with a class of nouns near the middle of the hierarchy being marked for both the agent and patient roles.

===Hierarchical alignment===
In a [[direct–inverse language]] clauses with [[transitive verb]]s can be expressed with either a direct or an inverse construction. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in salience or animacy. The inverse construction is used when the "notional object" outranks the "notional subject".

===Thematic roles===
A noun essentially requires the traits of animacy in order to receive the role of Actor and Experiencer. Additionally, the Agent role is generally assigned to the NP with highest ranking in the animacy hierarchy – ultimately, only animate beings can function as true agents.&lt;ref name="Szewczyk" /&gt; Similarly, languages universally tend to place animate nouns earlier in the sentence than inanimate nouns.&lt;ref name="Szewczyk" /&gt;
Animacy is a key component of agency – combined with other factors like “awareness of action”.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto" /&gt; Agency and animacy are intrinsically linked – with each as a “conceptual property” of the other.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto" /&gt;

{{Optical disc authoring}}
'''Archival Disc''' ('''AD''') is the name of a trademark owned by [[Sony|Sony Corporation]] and [[Panasonic|Panasonic Corporation]] describing an [[optical disc]] [[Data storage device|storage medium]] designed for long-term digital storage. First announced on 10&amp;nbsp;March 2014 and planned to be introduced in the second quarter of 2015, the discs are intended to be able to withstand changes in temperature and humidity, in addition to dust and water, ensuring that the disc is readable for at least 50 years.&lt;ref name="pcworld"/&gt; The agreement between Sony and Panasonic to jointly develop the upcoming generation optical media standard was first announced on 29&amp;nbsp;July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201307/13-0729E/index.html | title=Sony and Panasonic sign basic agreement to jointly develop standard for professional-use next-generation optical discs | publisher=[[Sony Corporation]] | date=2013-07-29 | accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications ==
The discs are designed to hold 300&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of data in their first release, then a second version of the discs will hold up to 500&amp;nbsp;gigabytes, and eventually a third version of the discs will be able to store up to one [[terabyte]] of data, based on the roadmap plans of both companies.&lt;ref name="sonyannounce2014"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201403/14-0310E/index.html | title='Archival Disc' standard formulated for professional-use next-generation optical discs | publisher=[[Sony Corporation]] | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcworld"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2106260/sony-panasonic-develop-300gb-optical-discs-for-enterprise-storage.html | title=Sony, Panasonic develop 300GB to 1TB 'Archival Disc' for 50 year-plus storage | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-03-21 | author=Hornyak, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/10/sony-panasonic-archival-disc/ | title=Sony and Panasonic announce the Archival Disc, a new optical disc standard for long-term storage | publisher=[[AOL Inc.]] | work=[[Engadget]] | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-03-21 | author=Smith, Mat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2454758,00.asp | title=Sony, Panasonic Tip 300GB&amp;nbsp;– 1TB Archival Storage Disc | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-03-21 | author=Moscaritolo, Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archival Disc standard jointly developed by Sony and Panasonic will utilise signal processing technologies such as narrow track pitch [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] cancellation, high [[linear density]] [[Intersymbol interference|inter-symbol interference]] cancellation and [[MultiLevel Recording|multi-level recording]]. The disc structure will feature dual sides, with three layers on each side, and a land and groove format. The track pitch is 0.225&amp;nbsp;μm, the data bit length is 79.5&amp;nbsp;nm, and the standard will utilise the method of [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon Code]] error detection.

== Roadmap ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Archival Disc Technology Roadmap.png|thumb|left|Archival Disc Roadmap]] --&gt;
[[Sony]] has released a roadmap plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201204/12-058E/ | title=Sony Moves Industry toward the Creation of New Mass-Storage Optical Disc Archive Solutions | publisher=[[Sony Corporation]] | date=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase Archival Disc capacity from 300GB to 1TB per disc.  The 300GB disc was scheduled for release in the summer of 2015, release timescales of the larger discs are currently unknown.

== Use ==
Sony expects the new standard to see usage in the film industry (such as storage of [[4K resolution]] audiovisual data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mactechnews.de/news/article/Blu-ray-Nachfolger-Archival-Disc-mit-300-GB-vorgestellt-157928.html | title=Blu-ray-Nachfolger: Archival Disc mit 300 GB vorgestellt | work=MacTechNews | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-03-22 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;), archival services, and [[cloud computing|cloud data centres]] handling [[big data]].&lt;ref name="sonyannounce2014"/&gt; The disc format is not intended as a consumer storage medium as of 2014, but is intended by the two companies as a solution for professional-level data archival.&lt;ref name="pcworld"/&gt; In order to reach a larger capacity whilst ensuring higher playback signal quality, the standard will employ crosstalk cancellation and [[partial response maximum likelihood]] (PRML) signal processing.&lt;ref name="sonyannounce2014"/&gt; Both companies will market the optical format under their respective brands.

Sony will be using Archival Disc in within the [[Optical Disc Archive]] professional archival product range.  Sony's aim is to create at least a 6TB storage medium.

An emerging use case for Archival Disc has been projected for cold data storage within the datacenter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://shop.panasonic.com/about-us-latest-news-press-releases/ces2016-freeze-ray-collaboration-facebook.html | title=Panasonic Develops freeze-ray Optical Disc-Based Data Archive System for Data Centers in Collaboration with Facebook | publisher=[[Panasonic Corporation]] | date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16674">'''Ashkenazi Hebrew''' ({{Lang-he-n|הגייה אשכנזית}} ''Hagiyya Ashkenazit'', {{Lang-yi|אַשכּנזישע הבֿרה}} ''Ashkenazishe Havara''), is the pronunciation system for [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical]] and [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic Hebrew]] favored for [[Liturgy|liturgical]] use and [[Torah study|study]] by [[Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi Jewish]] practice. It survives today as a separate [[Sacred language|religious dialect]] within some parts of the [[Haredi]] community, even alongside [[modern Hebrew]] in [[Israel]], although its use amongst non-Israeli Ashkenazi Jews has greatly diminished.

==Features==
As it is used parallel with modern Hebrew, its phonological differences are clearly recognized:
* א ''[[Aleph|{{transl|sem|ʾālep̄}}]]'' and ע ''[[Ayin|{{transl|sem|ʿáyin}}]]'' are completely silent at all times in most forms of Ashkenazi Hebrew, where they are frequently both pronounced as a [[glottal stop]] in modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;The practice of omitting the guttural letters "ayin" and "chet" is very ancient and goes back to Talmudic times (see ''[[Nathan ben Jehiel|Sefer He'aruch]]'' entry "shudah" as well as encyclopedia ''Otzar Yisrael'' entry "mivtah"), when it appears to have been a feature of Galilean pronunciation.&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare ''Yisroeil'' (Lithuanian) or ''Yisruayl'' (Polish-Galician) vs. ''Yisra'el'' (modern).) A special case is Dutch (and historically also [[Frankfurt am Main]]) Hebrew, where ‘ayin is traditionally pronounced as a [[velar nasal]] ({{IPAblink|ŋ}}), probably under the influence of the local [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]].
* ת ''[[Tav (letter)|{{transl|sem|ṯāw}}]]'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|s}} in Ashkenazi Hebrew, unless there is a [[Dagesh]] in the ת, where it would be pronounced {{IPAblink|t}}. It is always pronounced {{IPAblink|t}} in modern Hebrew. (Compare ''Shabbos'' vs. ''[[Shabbat]]'', or ''Es'' vs. ''Et''.)
* אֵ ''{{transl|sem|[[Tzere|ṣērê]]}}'' {{IPAslink|e}} is pronounced {{IPA-he|ej|}} (or {{IPA-he|aj|}}) in Ashkenazi Hebrew, where it would be pronounced {{IPAblink|e}} in [[Sephardi Hebrew]]; nodern Hebrew varies between the two pronunciations. (Compare ''Omein'' (Lithuanian) or ''Umayn'' (Polish-Galician) vs. ''Amen'' (modern Hebrew).)
* אָ ''{{transl|sem|qāmeṣ gāḏôl}}'' {{IPAslink|a}} is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɔ}} (it is always {{IPAblink|u}} in the Southern Dialects) in Ashkenazi Hebrew (Lithuanian pronunciation also tends to turn Qames gadol into the sound "uh" when it is stressed), where it is {{IPAblink|a}} in modern Hebrew. (Compare ''Dovid'' (Lithuanian) or ''Duvid'' (Polish-Galician) vs. ''David'' [David].)
* אֹ ''{{transl|sem|ḥôlam}}'' {{IPAslink|o}} is, depending on the subdialect, pronounced {{IPA-he|au|}}, {{IPA-he|ou|}}, {{IPA-he|øi|}}, {{IPA-he|oi|}}, or {{IPA-he|ei|}} in Ashkenazi Hebrew, where it is {{IPAblink|o}} (Some Lithuanians and many non-Hassidic Ashkenazim in America also pronounce it as the latter) in modern Hebrew. (Compare ''Moishe'' vs. ''Moshe''.)
* Unstressed אֻ ''qubbuṣ'' or וּ ''shuruq'' {{IPAslink|u}} occasionally becomes {{IPAblink|i}} in Ashkenazi Hebrew (This is more prevalent in the South-Eastern dialects as the North-Eastern dialects did not make reforms to this vowel), when in all other forms they are pronounced {{IPAblink|u}} (''Kíddish'' vs. ''kiddúsh''.) In the Hungarian and Oberlander dialects, the pronunciation is invariably {{IPAblink|y}}.
* There is some confusion (in both directions) between final אֵ ''[[tzere]]'' {{IPAslink|e}} and אִ ''hiriq'' {{IPAslink|i}} (''Tishrei'' vs. ''Tishri''; ''Sifri'' vs. ''Sifre''.)

==Variants==

There are considerable differences between the Lithuanian, Polish (also known as Galician), Hungarian, and German pronunciations. 
*These are most obvious in the treatment of ''{{transl|sem|ḥôlam}}'': the German pronunciation is [au], the Galician/Polish pronunciation is [oi], the Hungarian is [øi], and the Lithuanian pronunciation is [ei]. Other variants exist: for example in the United Kingdom, the original tradition was to use the German pronunciation, but over the years the sound of ''ḥolam'' has tended to merge with the local pronunciation of long "o" as in "toe", and some communities have abandoned Ashkenazi Hebrew altogether in favour of the Israeli-Sephardi pronunciation. ([[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities in England usually use the Galician/Polish [oi].)
*''Tzere'' is pronounced [ej] in the majority of Ashkenazic traditions. In Polish usage, however, it was not infrequently [aj].
*Another feature that distinguishes the Lithuanian pronunciation, traditionally used in an area encompassing modern day's Baltic States, Belarus and parts of Ukraine and Russia, is its merger of '''sin''' and '''shin''', both of which are pronounced as [s]. This is similar to the pronunciation of the [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraimites]] recorded in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 12, which is the source of the term [[Shibboleth]].
*The pronunciation of ''resh'' varies between an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]] (as in Spanish) and a [[voiced uvular fricative]] or [[uvular trill|trill]] (as in French, see [[Guttural R]]), depending on variations in the local dialects of German and Yiddish.

In addition to geographical differences, there are differences in register between the "natural" pronunciation in general use and the more [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] rules advocated by some rabbis and grammarians, particularly for use in reading the Torah. For example:

* In earlier centuries the stress in Ashkenazi Hebrew usually fell on the penultimate, instead of the last syllable as in most other dialects. In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a campaign by Ashkenazi rabbis such as [[Jacob Emden]] and the [[Vilna Gaon]] to encourage final stress in accordance with the stress marks printed in the Bible. This was successful as concerned liturgical use such as reading from the [[Torah]]. However, the older stress pattern persists in the pronunciation of Hebrew words in Yiddish and in early modern poetry by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].
* The merger of ח to כ and ע to א in speech occurred at some point between the 11th century and the 18th century, but many later Ashkenazi authorities (such as the [[Mishnah Berurah]] and [[Magen Avraham]]) advocate using the pharyngeal articulation of ח and ע when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah Chapter 53 quoting the Magen Avraham.&lt;/ref&gt; though this is seldom observed in practice. Similarly, strict usage requires the articulation of initial א as a glottal stop.
* In general use, the mobile ''sheva'' is often omitted (for example the word for "time" is pronounced ''zman'' rather than ''zĕman''). However, in liturgical use strict conformity to the grammatical rules is encouraged.

==History==
There are several theories on the origins of the different Hebrew reading traditions. The basic division is between those who believe that the differences arose in medieval Europe and those who believe that they reflect older differences between the pronunciations of Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] current in different parts of the Fertile Crescent, that is to say Judaea, Galilee, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and Babylonia proper. Within the first group of theories, [[Hirsch Jakob Zimmels|Zimmels]] believed that the Ashkenazi pronunciation arose in late medieval Europe and that the pronunciation prevailing in France and Germany in the time of the [[List of Tosafists|Tosafists]] was similar to the Sephardic. His evidence for this was the fact that [[Asher ben Jehiel]], a German who became chief rabbi of Toledo, never refers to any difference of pronunciation, though he is normally very sensitive to differences between the two communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The difficulty with the latter grouping of theories is that we do not know for certain what the pronunciations of these countries actually were and how far they differed. Since the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 (or before) the Sephardic pronunciation of the vowels became standard in all these countries, ironing out any differences that previously existed.&lt;ref&gt;To a lesser extent the same is true for the consonants, though the Jews of Iraq retain {{IPA|/w/}} for ''vav'' and {{IPA|/θ/}} for ''tav raphe'', and the Jews of Arabic countries generally retain emphatic and guttural consonant sounds: see [[Mizrahi Hebrew]].&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it harder to adjudicate between the different theories on the relationship between today's pronunciation systems and those of ancient times.

[[Leopold Zunz]] believed that the Ashkenazi pronunciation was derived from that of Palestine in [[Geonim|Geonic]] times (7th–11th centuries CE), while the Sephardi pronunciation was derived from that of Babylonia. This theory was supported by the fact that, in some respects, Ashkenazi Hebrew resembles the western dialect of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] while Sephardi Hebrew resembles the eastern, e.g. Eastern Syriac ''[[Peshitta]]'' as against Western Syriac ''Peshito''. Ashkenazi Hebrew in its written form also resembles Palestinian Hebrew in its tendency to ''male'' spellings (see [[Mater lectionis]]).

Others, including [[Abraham Zevi Idelsohn]], believed that the distinction is more ancient, and represents the distinction between the Judaean and Galilean dialects of Hebrew in Mishnaic times (1st−2nd centuries CE), with the Sephardi pronunciation being derived from Judaean and the Ashkenazi from Galilean. This theory is supported by the fact that Ashkenazi Hebrew, like [[Samaritan Hebrew]], has lost the distinct sounds of many of the guttural letters, while there are references in the [[Talmud]] to this as a feature of Galilean speech. Idelsohn ascribes the Ashkenazi (and, on his theory, Galilean) pronunciation of [[niqqud|kamatz gadol]] as [o] to the influence of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: see [[Canaanite shift]].

In the time of the [[Masoretes]] (8th−10th centuries CE) there were three distinct notations for denoting vowels and other details of pronunciation in Biblical and liturgical texts. One was the [[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]]; another was the [[Palestinian vocalization|Palestinian]]; the third was the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]], which eventually superseded the other two and is still in use today.

In certain respects the Ashkenazi pronunciation provides a better fit to the Tiberian notation than do the other reading traditions: for example, it distinguishes between ''pataḥ'' and ''qamaṣ gadol'', and between ''segol'' and ''șere'', and does not make the ''qamaṣ'' symbol do duty for two different sounds. A distinctive variant of the Tiberian notation was in fact used by Ashkenazim, before being superseded by the standard version. On the other hand, it is unlikely that in the Tiberian system ''ṣere'' and ''ḥolam'' were diphthongs as they are in Ashkenazi Hebrew: they are more likely to have been closed vowels. (On the other hand, these vowels sometimes correspond to diphthongs in Arabic.) For more details of the reconstructed pronunciation underlying the Tiberian notation, see [[Tiberian vocalization]].

In other respects Ashkenazi Hebrew resembles [[Yemenite Hebrew]], which appears to be related to the Babylonian notation. Shared features include the pronunciation of ''qamaṣ gadol'' as {{IPA|[o]}} and, in the case of [[Lithuanian Jews]] and some but not all Yemenites, of ''ḥolam'' as {{IPA|[eː]}}. These features are not found in the Hebrew pronunciation of today's Iraqi Jews, which as explained has been overlaid by [[Sephardi Hebrew]], but are found in some of the [[Judeo-Aramaic language]]s of northern Iraq and in some dialects of [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

Another possibility is that these features were found within an [[isogloss]] that included Syria, northern Palestine and northern Mesopotamia but not Judaea or Babylonia proper, and did not coincide exactly with the use of any one notation (and the ''ḥolam'' = {{IPA|[eː]}} shift may have applied to a more restricted area than the ''qamaṣ gadol'' = {{IPA|[o]}} shift). The Yemenite pronunciation would, on this hypothesis, be derived from that of northern Mesopotamia and the Ashkenazi pronunciation from that of northern Palestine. The Sephardic pronunciation appears to be derived from that of Judaea, as evidenced by its fit to the Palestinian notation.

According to [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|the Maharal of Prague]]&lt;ref&gt;''Tiferet Yisrael'', article 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and many other scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Listed in the encyclopedia ''Otsar Yisrael'' under the entry "mivtah".&lt;/ref&gt; including Rabbi [[Jacob Emden|Yaakov Emden]], one of the leading Hebrew grammarians of all time,&lt;ref&gt;''Mor Uqṣi'ah'', chap. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkenazi Hebrew is the most accurate pronunciation of Hebrew preserved. The reason given is that it preserves distinctions, such as between ''pataḥ'' and ''qamaṣ'', which are not reflected in the Sephardic and other dialects. Only in the Ashkenazi pronunciation are all seven "nequdot" (the Hebrew vowels of the ancient Tiberian tradition) distinguished: Yemenite, which comes close, does not distinguish ''pataḥ'' from ''segol''.

On the other hand, this view does not appear to be supported by any non-Ashkenazi scholars. Some scholars argue in favour of the greater authenticity of [[Yemenite Hebrew|the Yemenite pronunciation]] on the ground that it is the only Hebrew pronunciation to distinguish all the consonants.

==Influence on Modern Hebrew==

Although [[modern Hebrew]] was intended to be based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, the language as spoken in [[Israel]] has adapted to the popular (as opposed to the strict liturgical) Ashkenazi Hebrew [[phonology]] in the following respects:

*the elimination of [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal articulation]] in the letters ''Ḥeth'' and ''ʿAyin'' 
*the conversion of ''resh'' from an [[alveolar flap]] to a [[voiced uvular fricative]] or [[uvular trill|trill]] (but that is by no means universal in Ashkenazi Hebrew)
*the pronunciation of ''[[tzere]]'' as [eɪ] in some contexts, (''sifrey'' and ''teysha'' instead of Sephardic ''sifré'' and ''tésha''' )
*the elimination of vocal ''sheva'' (''zman'' instead of Sephardic ''zĕman'')
*some of the letter names (''yud'' and ''kuf'' instead of Sephardic ''yod'' and ''qof/kof'')
*in popular speech, penultimate stress in proper names (''Dvóra'' instead of ''Dĕvorá''; ''Yehúda'' instead of ''Yehudá'')
*similarly, penultimate stress in nouns or verbs with a second- or third-person plural suffix (''katávtem'' [you wrote] instead of ''kĕtavtém''; ''shalom aléykhem'' [greeting] instead of ''shalom alekhém'').&lt;ref&gt;Sucj pronunciations may have originated in learners' mistakes, formed on the analogy of other suffixed forms (''katávta'', ''alénu''), rather than being examples of residual Ashkenazi influence.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automatic taxonomy construction''' (ATC) is the use of software programs to generate taxonomical classifications from a body of texts called a [[text corpus|corpus]]. ATC is a branch of [[natural language processing]], which in turn is a branch of [[artificial intelligence]]. 

A [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is a model used to organize and index knowledge (stored as documents, articles, videos, etc.) so that users can find the information they are searching for. Taxonomies are typically [[tree structure]]d and divide a domain into categories based on the value of properties called taxa. Taxonomies were first [[Taxonomy (biology)|used by biologists]] to group organisms into categories such as ''kingdom'', ''phylum'', ''genus'', and ''species''. Taxonomies are often represented as [[Is-a|''is-a'' hierarchies]] where each level is more specific (in mathematical language "a subset of") the level above it. For example, a basic biology taxonomy would have concepts such as ''mammal'', which is a subset of ''animal'', and ''dogs'' and ''cats'', which are subsets of ''mammal''. This kind of taxonomy is called an is-a model because the specific objects are considered instances of a concept. For example, ''Fido'' is-a instance of the concept ''dog'' and ''Fluffy'' is-a ''cat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brachman|first1=Ronald|title=What IS-A is and isn't. An Analysis of Taxonomic Links in Semantic Networks|journal=IEEE Computer|date=October 1983|volume=16|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[linguistics]], is-a relations are called [[hyponymy]]. Words that describe categories are called hypernyms and words that are examples of categories are hyponyms. In the simple biology example ''dog'' is a hypernym and ''Fido'' is one of its hyponyms. A word can be both a hyponym and a hypernym. For example, ''dog'' is a hyponym of ''mammal'' and also a hypernym of ''Fido''. In ATC programs one of the most important tasks is the discovery of hypernym and hyponym relations among words. 

The development and maintenance of a taxonomy is a knowledge-intensive task requiring significant time and resources. Also, domain modelers have their own point of view which inevitably, even if unintentionally, work their way into the model. ATC uses artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate a taxonomy for a domain in order to avoid these problems. There are several approaches to ATC. One approach is to use rules to detect patterns in the corpus and use those patterns to infer relations such as hyponymy. Other approaches use [[machine learning]] techniques such as [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian inferencing]] and [[Artificial Neural Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neshati|first1=Mahmood|last2=Alijamaat|first2=Ali|last3=Abolhassani|first3=Hassan|last4=Rahimi|first4=Afshin|last5=Hoseini|first5=Mehdi|title=Taxonomy Learning Using Compound Similarity Measure|journal=IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence|date=2–5 November 2007|doi=10.1109/WI.2007.135|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4427141/|accessdate=8 March 2017|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATC systems have been used to automatically generate large ontologies for domains such as insurance and finance. They have also been used to enhance existing large networks such as [[Wordnet]] to make them more complete and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velardi|first1=Paola|last2=Faralli|first2=Stefano|last3=Navigli|first3=Roberto|title=OntoLearn Reloaded: A Graph-based Algorithm for Taxonomy Induction|journal=Computational Linguistics|date=10 October 2012|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.278.5674&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=8 March 2017|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Xueqing|last2=Song|first2=Yangqiu|last3=Liu|first3=Shixia|last4=Wang|first4=Haixun|title=Automatic Taxonomy Construction from Keywords|journal=KDD ’12|date=12–16 August 2012|url=https://421dc2a5-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/yqsong/BRT_KeywordTaxonomy_new.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqn5x9UFUrOhcqJ9CcwJnZugYiEyb2MpiEp25aBFHz3sPQ-Ni1h8EgwMxNG5QAkVQm00__cwYjNIncLormscadWaMsL5Whjv7hHUqDUOmpOWsOytcWA0iuc_sUaJnCQR0TKNuvgdZFgEWXNFxR4j5wZWp9d3Lbkr1h2G3R1U6ytzk4g2r-JlA_RWWTomcUZigE3ZCQoUghj8eeNkcmGqjlzAXvSc5-mLdz-XRG_b-mhiT7CHxQ%3D&amp;attredirects=0|accessdate=7 March 2017|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snow|first1=Rion|last2=Jurafsky|first2=Daniel|last3=Ng|first3=Andrew|title=Semantic Taxonomy Induction from Heterogenous Evidence|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/acl06-semantictaxonomyinduction.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2017|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baghdad Arabic''' or the '''Baghdadi Arabic''' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Varieties of Arabic|dialect]] spoken in [[Baghdad]], the capital of [[Iraq]]. During the last century, Baghdad Arabic has become the [[lingua franca]] of Iraq, and the language of commerce and education.  It is a subvariety of [[Mesopotamian Arabic]].

An interesting sociolinguistic feature of Baghdadi Arabic is the existence of three distinct dialects: Muslim, [[Baghdad Arabic (Jewish)|Jewish]] and Christian Baghdadi Arabic. Muslim Baghdadi belongs to a group called ''gilit'' dialects, while Jewish Baghdadi (as well as Christian Baghdadi) belongs to ''qeltu'' dialects.

Baghdadi ''gilit'' Arabic, which is considered the standard Baghdadi Arabic, shares many features with varieties spoken in some parts of eastern [[Syria]]. ''Gilit'' Arabic is of [[Bedouin]] provenance, unlike Christian and Jewish Baghdadi, which is believed to be descendant of Medieval [[Iraqi Arabic]]. Until the 1950s Baghdad Arabic contained a large inventory of borrowings from [[English language|English]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Kurdish language]].

During the first decades of the 20th century, when the population of Baghdad was less than a million, some inner city quarters had their own distinctive speech characteristics, maintained for generations. From about the 1960s, with the population movement within the city, and the influx of large numbers of people hailing mainly from the south, Baghdad Arabic has become more standardized, and has come to incorporate some rural Bedouin features and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] loanwords.

Distinct features of Muslim Baghdadi Arabic include the use of 'ani' as opposed to the fusha 'ana' meaning 'I am' and the addition of the suffix 'ich' to verbs with female direct objects, e.g. 'ani gilitlich' meaning 'I told you' whereas [[maslawi]]s would say: 'ana qeltolki'.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===

===Consonants===

Even in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the 28 consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Note that Arabic is particularly rich in [[uvular consonant|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], and [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]") sounds. The emphatic [[coronal consonant|coronal]]s ({{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}) cause [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} The phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} ⟨[[Pe (Persian letter)|پ]]⟩ and {{IPA|/v/}} ⟨[[Ve (Arabic letter)|ڤ]]⟩ (not used by all speakers) are not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory, as they exist only in foreign words and they can be pronounced as {{IPA|/b/}} ⟨[[ب]]⟩ and {{IPA|/f/}} ⟨[[ف]]⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.&lt;ref name="TYA"&gt;Teach Yourself Arabic, by Jack Smart (Author), Frances Altorfer (Author)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;Hans Wehr, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' (transl. of ''Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart'', 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">'''Body worship''' is any practice of physically revering a part of another person's body, and is usually done as a submissive act in the context of [[BDSM]].&lt;ref name="polari"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang|author=Paul Baker|publisher=Continuum|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical kinds of body worship include worship of [[muscles]], the [[human penis|penis]], the [[vagina]], or the [[buttocks]]. 

Usually accompanied by [[prostration]], re-enforcing a sense of inferiority, a "[[submissive (BDSM)|sub]]" generally licks, kisses and sucks their [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]]'s body part, and is not allowed to touch it in a more conventional way. This brings aspect of [[Humiliation (BDSM)|erotic humiliation]] to submissive partner.

Worshipping a body can also be done because the worshipper is in awe of the body part and wishes to praise that beauty. Although encouragement may be provided, verbally or by [[erotic spanking|spanking]], body worship is typically received more or less passively, the worshipped party aloof. [[Facesitting]] and [[smothering]] are forms of body worship which differ chiefly because of their aggressive approach.

Body worship is a common theme in the work of Japanese fetish artist Namio Harukawa.

==Subsets==
'''Penis worship''' generally describes a [[sexual obsession]] of a submissive with their dominant partner's [[human penis|penis]]; or any type of sexual game in which a submissive is motivated by a real or pretended attraction to their partner's penis.

Penis worship may also describe a BDSM practice in which a submissive kisses and licks the dominant partner's penis. Some consider such worship as a particularly degrading form of domination and will usually involve the submissive partner kneeling or in another lowly position, treating the worshipped person as the dominant. In particular, facesitting or smothering may be applied to emphasise the control of the dominant over the submissive. A [[Facesitting|queening stool]] may also facilitate this activity.

Similarly, '''vagina worship''' describes a sexual fascination with the female and female sex organs, along with all the practices related to the deification of the female and her respective and 'representative' sexual organ.

In BDSM, vagina worship may also describe a practice in which a submissive kisses and licks the vagina and/or anus of the dominant partner. [[Facesitting]] or smothering may be practiced, and a [[queening stool]] may be used.

The '''broadcast calendar''' is a standardized [[calendar]] used primarily for the planning and purchase of [[radio]] and [[television]] programs and [[advertising]].&lt;ref name="tvb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvb.org/planning_buying/179695/5658 |title=Broadcast Calendar / Nielsen Survey Dates |publisher=TVB |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007010739/http://www.tvb.org/planning_buying/179695/5658 |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every week in the broadcast calendar starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday, and every month has either four or five such weeks. Broadcast calendar months thus have either 28 or 35 days.

The key link between the broadcast and [[Gregorian calendar]]s is that the first week of every broadcast month always contains the Gregorian calendar first of the month. For example, if January 1 falls on a Saturday, then the broadcast calendar year would begin on the preceding Monday, December 27. Broadcast January would then have five weeks, ending on January 30, and the four weeks of broadcast February would begin on January 31. The number of weeks in a broadcast month is based on the number of Sundays that fall in that month with the period ending on the last Sunday of the month.&lt;ref name="tvb" /&gt;

Days and weeks in a broadcast calendar are often referred to by number rather than name, as in Week 47, Day 3. Since each week starts on a Monday, day three is always a Wednesday, while week 47 is always the 47th week of the broadcast calendar year. The Gregorian equivalent in a given year can be looked up on any number of published calendars that are freely available for download on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rab.com/public/reports/broadcastCalendar.cfm?type=nm |title=Broadcast Calendars |publisher=RAB.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast calendar years can have either 52 or 53 weeks.  A broadcast calendar will have 53 weeks in a [[leap year]] where January 1 falls on a [[leap year starting on Saturday|Saturday]] or [[leap year starting on Sunday|Sunday]], or in a [[common year]] where January 1 falls on a [[common year starting on Sunday|Sunday]].  In the 21st century, 53-week broadcast calendar years are 2006, 2012, 2017, 2023, 2028, 2034, 2040, 2045, 2051, 2056, 2062, 2068, 2073, 2079, 2084, 2090, and 2096.

The broadcast calendar often closely matches certain specialized financial calendars, such as the [[4-4-5 calendar]], but the length of a broadcast month can vary year to year. The broadcast year differs in most years from the [[ISO week year]], although both start the week on Monday, because ISO starts with the week containing the first Thursday (and January 4) instead of the first Sunday (and January 1).

Furthermore,  start of a broadcast day is typically not at midnight, but near morning, usually at or near 5 a.m. local time.

'''CAVE People''' (an [[acronym]] for "'''Citizens Against Virtually Everything'''") is a [[pejorative]] term for citizens who regularly oppose any changes in their community, organization or workplace.&lt;ref name="Barrett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Barrett|title=The Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hc7x96jE5EcC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2006|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-530447-3|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RossPerry1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joel E.

The phenomenon is linked to the so-called [[NIMBY]] (Not In My Back Yard) phenomenon in which residents oppose a development ostensibly on the grounds of it being inappropriate for the local area.&lt;ref name="SalsichTryniecki1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter W. Salsich|author2=Timothy J.

This attitude is manifested in opposition to changes in [[public policy]] as varied as tax levies, sewer rates, public transportation routes, parking regulations and [[municipal]] mergers or [[annexation]]s.  CAVE People often express their views publicly by attending community meetings,&lt;ref name="Beyle1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thad L. Beyle|title=State Government: CQ's Guide to Current Issues and Activities 1998–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGi_m_3fbqgC|year=1998|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|isbn=978-1-56802-098-3|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing letters to the local newspaper, or calling in to [[talk radio]] shows.

==Origin==
A reference to the term "CAVE dwellers" can be found in the September 30, 1990 edition of the ''Orlando Sentinel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/doc/277722280.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep%2030,%201990&amp;author=Bo%20Poertner,%20Volusia%20County%20Editor&amp;pub=Orlando%20Sentinel&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=K.4&amp;desc=IS%20LATEST%20CRITICISM%20WORTHWHILE%20TALK%20OR%20JUST%20WORTHLESS?|title=Is latest criticism worthwhile talk or just worthless?|author=Bo Poertner|date=September 30, 1990|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|quote="County Council Chairwoman Alice Cycler handed me a copy of an editorial from a North Florida newspaper last week. It talked about CAVE dwellers, CAVE meaning Citizens Against Virtually Everything. Volusia County has its fair share of CAVE dwellers, Mrs. Cycler said. I couldn't disagree."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by the author of the [[opinion piece]], "Is latest criticism worthwhile talk or just worthless?", which references another, unnamed, Florida newspaper, indicating that the term existed even before the publication of this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3292">The '''Charter of Povlja''' ({{lang-hr|Povaljska listina}}) is a legal document written on 1 December 1250 in [[Povlja]] on the island of [[Brač]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=49822 |contribution=Povaljska listina |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is parchment copy of an ownership document from the [[cartulary]] of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of St John the Baptist. It is one of the oldest [[Croatian language|Croatian]] cultural and linguistic records, which through its content provides a number of interesting insights into the various aspects of the time in which it was made. The first modern edition was published in 1881 by [[Franjo Rački]] in his book ''Starine'' (''Antiquities'').

It is written in [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] script by Ivan, the canon of the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius|Cathedral Church of Split]] and a [[Hvar]] [[notary]], at the request of the Povlja abbot Ivan, and by order of the [[Bishop of Hvar]] Nikola. The template for the first part of the charter was Prince Brečko's charter from 1184, which regulated territorial relations between the estate of the monastery and the island's prince and [[župan]]. That template charter is almost entirely included within the Charter of Povlja.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

The terse list of monastic estates reveal the Old Croatian tribal and clan common law procedures, and legal formulations contain recognizable vernacular and literary expressions, absent in later legal documents. Today it is kept in the parish office in [[Pučišća]].&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

== Language ==
In the text of the Charter, two language layers can be seen: the common national language, which is the [[Chakavian]] dialect of Brač, its linguistic superstructure is provided by the contemporary literary language, which is [[Old Church Slavonic]] of Croatian recension, that gave the whole text a more formal feel. There are also a considerable number of words of [[Romance languages|Romance]] origin.

Its undifferentiated writing shows the author’s knowledge of various contemporary Cyrillic schools on one side and the influence of Latin writing customs on the other. These influences reveal an important linguistic information. Namely, the unusualness of the use of graphs in the graphic series ''ѣ'' (yat), ''ы'' (yery), ''i'' and ''e'' indicates that in those region at that time there was already established an [[Ikavian Chakavian|Ikavian]] reflex of the yat (with the possibility of some words being [[Ekavian]]).

'''Cornelius Nepos''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɔr|ˈ|n|iː|l|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|n|iː|p|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|n|ɛ|p|ɒ|s}}; c. 110 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 25 BC) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] biographer. He was born at [[Hostilia]], a village in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] not far from [[Verona]]. 

==Biography==
Nepos's Cisalpine birth is attested by [[Ausonius]], and [[Pliny the Elder]] calls him ''Padi accola'' ("a dweller on the River [[Po River|Po]]", ''Naturalis historia'' III.127). He was a friend of [[Catullus]], who dedicates his poems to him (I.3), [[Cicero]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]]. [[Eusebius]] places him in the fourth year of the reign of [[Augustus]], which is supposed to be when he began to attract critical acclaim by his writing. [[Pliny the Elder]] notes he died in the reign of Augustus (''Natural History'' IX.39, X.23).

His simple style of writing has made him, in the UK at least, a standard choice for passages of unseen translation in Latin exams, from [[Preparatory School (UK)|prep school]], even up to degree level.

==Works==

Nearly all of Nepos's writings are lost, but several allusions to them survive in works by other authors. [[Aulus Gellius]]'s ''Attic Nights'' are of special importance in this respect.

* ''Chronica'', an epitome of universal history; [[Catullus]] seems to allude to the "Chronica" in his [[Catullus 1|dedication to Nepos]].  [[Ausonius]] also mentions it in his sixteenth Epistle to Probus, as does [[Aulus Gellius]] in the ''Noctes Atticae'' (XVII.21).  "Probably a chronological summary which included the history of outside nations as well as of Rome," it is thought to have been written in three books.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Arthur W. ''Selected Lives from Cornelius Nepos.'' Boston: Ginn &amp; Company, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Exempla'', a collection of anecdotes after the style of Valerius Maximus; ''Exemplorum libri'', of which [[Charisius]] cites the second book, and [[Aulus Gellius]] the fifth (VI.18, 19). The book likely contained "models for imitation, drawn from the early Romans, whose simplicity contrasted with the luxury" of Nepos' era.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt;"

* letters to Cicero; ''De Vita Ciceronis''. Aulus Gellius corrects an error in this work (XV.28). The book is thought to have been written after the death of the consul, statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. According to Roberts, "his friendship for Cicero and Atticus and his access to their correspondence would have made the work an especially valuable one for us."

* lives of Cato the elder; A complete biography of Cato the Censor, from which Aulus Gellius draws an anecdote of [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] (IX.8).

* ''De viris illustribus'', parallel lives of distinguished Romans and foreigners, in sixteen books.

* ''Epistulae ad Ciceronem'', an extract of which survives in [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri Septem'' III.15). It is unclear whether they were ever formally published.

[[Pliny the Younger]] mentions verse written by Nepos, and in his own ''Life of Dion'', Nepos himself refers to a work of his own authorship, ''De Historicis''. If a separate work, this would be from a hypothesized ''De Historicis Latinis'', only one book in the larger ''De Viris Inlustribus'' (see below), although exclusively comprising biographies of Romans. Pliny also mentions a longer ''Life of Cato'' at the end of the extant ''Life of Cato'', written at the request of [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], the "complete biography" now lost.

His only surviving work is the ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae''. This book is in fact only one volume of Nepos' larger "De Viris Illustribus," originally containing "descriptions of foreign and Roman kings, generals, lawyers, orators, poets, historians, and philosophers," in addition to this sole surviving (and thought to be complete) book of commanders and generals (''imperatores'').&lt;ref&gt;Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in the reign of [[Theodosius I]], as the work of the grammarian Aemilius Probus, who presented it to the emperor with a dedication in Latin verse.  He claims it to have been the work of his mother or father (the manuscripts vary) and his grandfather. Despite the obvious questions (such as why the preface addressed to someone named Atticus when the work was supposedly dedicated to Theodosius), no one seemed to have doubted Probus's authorship. Eventually Peter Cornerus{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} discovered in a manuscript of [[Cicero]]'s letters the biographies of Cato and Atticus. He added them to the other existing biographies, despite the fact that the writer speaks of himself as a contemporary and friend of Atticus, and that the manuscript bore the heading ''E libro posteriore Cornelii Nepotis'' ('from the last book of Cornelius Nepos'). At last [[Dionysius Lambinus]]'s edition of 1569 bore a commentary demonstrating on stylistic grounds that the work must have been of Nepos alone, and not Aemilius Probus. This view has been tempered by more recent scholarship{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which agrees with Lambinus that they are the work of Nepos, but that Probus probably abridged the biographies when he added the verse dedication. The ''Life of Atticus'', however, is considered to be the exclusive composition of Nepos.

In [[construction]], '''cross bracing''' is a [[system]] utilized to reinforce [[building]] structures in which diagonal supports intersect. Cross bracing can increase a building’s capability to withstand seismic activity. Bracing is important in earthquake resistant buildings because it helps keep a structure standing. Cross bracing is usually seen with two diagonal supports placed in an X shaped manner; these support compression and  [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces. Depending on the forces, one [[Cross brace|brace]] may be in tension while the other is slack. It helps make buildings sturdier and more likely to withstand lateral forces. Cross bracing can be applied to any rectangular frame [[structure]], such as chairs and bookshelves. In [[steel]] construction, steel cables may be used due to their great resistance to tension (although not resistant at all to [[compression (physical)|compression]]). 
The common uses for cross bracing includes bridge (side) supports, along with structural foundations. This method of construction maximizes the weight of the load a structure is able to support. It is a usual application when constructing earthquake-safe buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationtech.com/FEMA-WEB/FEMA-subweb-EQ/02-02-EARTHQUAKE/1-BUILDINGS/MITIGATIONS/2-W2-cross_bracing.htm Reinforce Building With Cross Bracing], Earthquake Handbook, FEMA Hazard Mitigation Handbook Series, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=November 2009}}

'''European Islam''' or '''Modern Islam''' is a hypothesized new [[branches of Islam|branch of Islam]], (reformed Islam) in [[Southeastern Europe]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Albania]].

In recent years,{{When|date=April 2018}} research on Muslim communities in Europe has shifted from labor and social policy concerns to issues of 'religion' and 'culture'. In particular, there has been a growing interest in the possible emergence of a specifically 'European Islam'. The collective hypothesis that seems to be forming is - according to [[sociologist]] that currently is adapting and in coming years Islam will adapt to 'new' European structures in a way that will enable Muslims to consider themselves full European citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubofamsterdam.com/content.asp?contentid=388|title=Muslim girls in Belgium: individual freedom through religion?|last=Fadil|first=N.|publisher=clubofamsterdam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term euro Islam was introduced at a conference in Birmingham in the UK in 1988. Leader and initiator of the conference was Carl E. Olivestam, senior lecturer at Umea University, also Director at the Board of Universities and Colleges in Sweden. Islam in England, Germany and France, examples of European countries with large Islamic populations, could be named Euroislam. The term was first published in the Swedish handbook: Kyrkor och alternativa rörelser. (Churches and alternative Movements). There are two European Muslims who dominate the debate on Euro-Islam: [[Bassam Tibi]], and [[Tariq Ramadan]], who adopted the term in 1999 but are using it in a different meaning.

==Proponents==
=== Tariq Ramadan ===
[[Tariq Ramadan]] is considered to be one of the coiners of the term "European Islam". Ramadan calls for creating a new European-Muslim identity in his book "To Be a European Muslim" (1999).&lt;ref&gt;The origin of the term predates Ramadan's book. Bassam Tibi coined the term in his 1992 paper "Conditions d'un Euro-Islam," published in R. Bistolfi und F. Zabbal (Eds.), In Islams d'Europe, Paris 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He demands participation of Muslims in social and cultural life in conformation with European culture and Muslim ethics and says Muslims should disassociate themselves from [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tariq |last=Ramadan|authorlink=Tariq Ramadan|url= http://mondediplo.com/2000/06/12muslim |title=Who speaks for Europe’s Muslims?|date= June 2000|publisher=mondediplo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[terrorism]]. He also thinks that European Muslims "need to separate Islamic principles from their cultures of origin and anchor them in the cultural reality of Western Europe."&lt;ref&gt;N. Le Quesne, "Trying to Bridge A Great Divide" in ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ramadan says that "Europeans also must start considering Islam as a European religion."&lt;ref name="Ahram" /&gt;

===Bassam Tibi===

German-Syrian [[Bassam Tibi]] coined in 1992&lt;ref&gt;Bassam Tibi, Les conditions d'un "euro-islam" in R. Bistolfi und F. Zabbal (Eds.), Islams d'Europe : intégration ou insertion communautaire?, Paris, Editions de l'Aube, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "Euro-Islam" to describe a type of Islam that embraces Western political values, such as pluralism, tolerance, and the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/slot1_071405.html&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Muslims in Europe must create a specific form of Islam that can coexist with European values. The term reflects a concept for the integration of Muslims as European citizens, often assuming a [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal]] and progressive interpretation based on the idea of Europeanizing Islam. [[Bassam Tibi]] dissociates himself from the [[Islamists]], who reject Euro-Islam.  He estimates that they amount to 3%-5% of the Muslims currently living in Europe.  He says they are nevertheless a dangerous minority since they want to "hijack" the Muslim community and other values of civil society. Tibi speaks of the need of Muslims to become "European citizens of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;See Tibi's article "A Migration Story: From Muslim Immigrants to European “Citizens of the Heart?“" in: [[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]] Vol.31 (Winter 2007) 1: 191-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibi insists that Euro-Islam means secularity, the acceptance of [[separation of church and state|separation between religion and state]], as well as that Muslims embrace European values.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berman, The Flight of the Intellectuals, Melville House 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}  As contrast he sees the [[ghettoization]] of the Muslims with potential for conflict.&lt;ref&gt;See Bassam Tibi, "Euro-Islam: An Alternative to Islamization and Ethnicity of Fear", in: Zeyno Baran (Ed.), The Other Muslims: Moderate and Secular, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, pp. 175-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Euro-Islam is for Tibi a way out from the issue of the [[ethnicization]] of Muslim migration in Europe and a democratic alternative to the so-called "ethnicity of fear".&lt;ref&gt;On the ethnicization of Islam in Europe see Tibi's chapter in Roland Hsu (Ed.), Ethnic Europe: Mobility, Identity, and Conflict in a Globalized World, Stanford University Press, 2010, pp. 127-156; also Bassam Tibi, "Ethnicity of Fear? Islamic Migration and the Ethnicization of Islam in Europe," in: Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism, Vol. 11, No. 1, 2010, pp. 126-157.&lt;/ref&gt; But after 25 years of leadership towards promoting an Euro-Islam, Bassam Tibi announced in the magazine Cicero (June issue) "I capitulate", stating that the "headscarf Islam" has triumphed over the "Euro-Islam".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cicero.de/kultur/islamologe-bassam-tibi-ich-kapituliere&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Luisa Maniscalco===

[[Maria Luisa Maniscalco]], professor of Sociology at the University of Roma Tre, in her book "European Islam. Sociology of an encounter", considers that in a process of "Europeanisation" of Muslims and "Islamization" of Europe directions of change are diverse.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Luisa Maniscalco, Islam Europeo. Sociologia di un incontro, Milano, FrancoAngeli, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; While family law, the status of women, religious freedom, social justice and criminal laws are still areas of high controversy within Islam, in Europe and elsewhere, and in comparison with European societies, attempts to Islamize modernity performed in European territory and in dialogue with Europe express creativity and innovation capacity. According to Maniscalco, when different segments of the Muslim world in Europe will propose themselves and will act as "active minorities", being able to take leadership and provide new impetus towards a dynamic and positive meeting, this will be significant for the future of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Francesco |last=Antonelli|title= La fede trovata nella cittadinanza in Il Manifesto, 20 febbraio 2015|url=http://ilmanifesto.info/la-fede-trovata-nella-cittadinanza/|publisher=ilmanifesto.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xavier Bougarel===

[[Xavier Bougarel]], research fellow at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] in the Ottoman and Turkish Studies unit, thinks that [[Balkan]] Muslims are playing an important role in the evolution of Islam in Europe towards a European Islam. With the possible [[EU enlargement]] towards the Balkans, about eight million Muslims would become EU citizens, doubling the number of Muslims in the EU-27 bloc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epc.eu/en/er.asp?AI=559&amp;LV=293&amp;PG=ER/EN/detail&amp;TYP=ER&amp;see=y&amp;t=2 European Policy Centre Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bougarel explores Balkan Islam which is often called "European Islam " because it resulted from indigenous and largely secularized in opposition to "a non- European Islam" that embody not only the predominantly Muslim countries but also the Muslim populations newly settled in Western Europe. Xavier Bougarel proposes to replace these culturalist visions by an accurate comparison taking into account the nuances of the realities of Islam in Western Europe and in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Bougarel, Balkans.  Les différentes facettes de l’islam, in P@ges Europe, La Documentation française © DILA, 1° aprile 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jocelyne Cesari===

[[Jocelyne Cesari]], research associate at the Center for [[Middle Eastern Studies]] at [[Harvard University]] and director of [[Islamopedia Online]], says that while Islam is perceived as colliding with European secular values "Islam is simply a religion."&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/fo2.htm |title=Enemy within|publisher='' [[Al Ahram Weekly]]''|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Cesari, Muslims need to reveal the "genuine tolerant face of Islam, to show its diversity and reveal to the world that an intellectual such as [[Muhammad Abduh]] is the best example for a modern thinker."&lt;ref name="Ahram" /&gt;

Cesari talks of the [[secularization]] of individual Islamic practices and of Islamic institutions, as well as the efforts Muslims are making to maintain the relevancy of Islamic legal systems and what she calls the "gender jihad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|asin=1403971463|title= When Islam and Democracy Meet: Muslims in Europe and in the United States |first=J. |last=Cesari}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She thinks that Islam should be merged into European culture and that Islamic culture should be added to Europe's educational curricula.&lt;ref name="Ahram" /&gt;

===Jørgen S. Nielsen===

[[Jørgen S. Nielsen]], professor of Islamic studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]] says that "Europeanizing" Islam "requires changes in relations between the sexes, in relations between parents and children, significant changes in attitudes to people of other religions, and in attitudes toward the state."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ford, "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0224/p10s01-woeu.html Europe's rising class of believers: Muslims]", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 2005-02-24&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen believes that this is happening. While only a minority of Muslims is assimilating completely with secular European culture, "the majority are sticking to their religion but divorcing it from the cultural tradition and redressing it in a new culture." Nielsen also argues that the emergence of a European Islam is not only linked to the Muslim communities in Europe, but also to structures inherited from European society and the State.&lt;ref&gt;Jørgen S. Nielsen, Towards a European Islam, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches to integration===

====Robert S. Leiken====
[[Robert S. Leiken]] says that both the [[multiculturalism]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] methods failed and that an integration policy still needs to be developed, something which will not happen overnight.&lt;ref name="Ahram" /&gt;

==European Commission proposal==
Following the [[2007 London car bombs|failed car bomb attacks in London]] and the [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack|failed Glasgow airport attack]] in June 2007, the [[European Commission]] started pooling ideas on how to tackle radical Islam and create a "European Islam", i.e. an Islam which is a more tolerant "European" branch of the faith.&lt;ref name=EUobserver&gt;Renata Goldirova, "[http://euobserver.com/9/24436 Brussels questions EU capitals over approach to Islam]" in ''the [[EUobserver]]'', July 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; EU home affairs commissioner [[Franco Frattini]] also sent out an 18-question survey asking EU member states how they address violent radicalisation, mainly related to an abusive interpretation of Islam.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} In addition, Mr Frattini wants to pursue and further the idea of establishing a so-called "European Islam" or "Islam de l'Europe" – something floated by France's then interior minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=EUobserver/&gt;

{{Fascism sidebar|expanded=Related}}

Since the emergence of [[fascism]] in Europe in the first half of the 20th century, the term "fascist" has frequently been used as a [[pejorative]] epithet against a wide range of individuals, political movements, governments, public and private institutions, including those that would not usually be classified as fascist in mainstream political science. It usually serves as an emotionally loaded substitute for [[authoritarian]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As early as 1944, British writer [[George Orwell]] commented that following its widespread use in the European press, "the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless" due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.&lt;ref&gt;"It will be seen that, as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.", [[George Orwell]], [http://orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc What is Fascism?], 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
The [[Bolshevik]] movement and later the [[Soviet Union]] made frequent use of the "fascist" epithet coming from its conflict with the early German and Italian fascist movements. It was widely used in press and political language to describe either its ideological opponents (such as the [[White movement]]) or even internal fractions of the [[socialism|socialist]] movement (for example, [[social democracy]] which was called [[social fascism]]). Also the [[Nazi]] movement in Germany was described as "fascist" until 1939, when the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was signed, after which [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–41)|Nazi–Soviet relations]] started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

After the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, "fascist" was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to [[Marxism–Leninism]], fascism was the "final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie", which "in fascism sought refuge" from "inherent contradictions of capitalism". As a result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was "fascist", with the [[Third Reich]] being just the "most reactionary" one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/istoriya_voyny_na_tihom_okeane/16.html | title=Наступление фашизма и задачи Коммунистического Интернационала в борьбе за единство рабочего класса против фашизма | work=7th Comintern Congress | date=20 August 1935 | accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/12/01/02.html | title=Фашизм – наиболее мрачное порождение империализма | work=История второй мировой войны 1939–1945 гг. | date=1973 | accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1941, "fascist" was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on [[Katyn massacre]] was described as "fascist libel"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stiller]], "Semantyka zbrodni"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Warsaw Uprising]] as "illegal and organised by fascists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e-warszawa.com/e-warszawa/1944-powstanie | title=1944 – Powstanie Warszawskie | publisher=e-Warszawa.com | accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] described [[Trotskyism]], [[Titoism]] and imperialism as "variants of fascism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://katalog.bip.ipn.gov.pl/showDetails.do?idx=P&amp;katalogId=2&amp;subpageKatalogId=2&amp;pageNo=1&amp;nameId=18103&amp;osobaId=33354&amp; | title=Dane osoby z katalogu funkcjonariuszy aparatu bezpieczeństwa – Franciszek Przeździał | publisher=Instytut Pamięci Narodowej | date=1951 | accessdate=2015-08-31 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120080346/http://katalog.bip.ipn.gov.pl/showDetails.do?idx=P&amp;katalogId=2&amp;subpageKatalogId=2&amp;pageNo=1&amp;nameId=18103&amp;osobaId=33354&amp; | archivedate=November 20, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was used by leftist critics to describe the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. The term was later used in the 2000s to describe the administration of [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

In 2004, [[Samantha Power]] (lecturer at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]) reflected Orwell's words from 60 years prior when she stated: "Fascism – unlike communism, socialism, capitalism, or conservatism – is a smear word more often used to brand one's foes than it is a descriptor used to shed light on them".&lt;ref&gt;Power, Samantha.

In 2006, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found contrary to the Article 10 (freedom of expression) of [[ECHR]] fining a journalist for calling a right-wing journalist "local neo-fascist", regarding the statement as a value-judgment acceptable in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=811485&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=Case of Karman v.

In 2014, with the outbreak of the [[war in Donbass]] the [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] and media returned to the "fascist" rhetoric, frequently describing the Ukrainian government after [[Euromaidan]] as "fascist", "Nazi" etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://time.com/3545855/russia-ukraine-war-history/ | title=Russians Re-write History to Slur Ukraine Over War | publisher=Time | date=2014-10-29 | accessdate=2014-10-30 | author=Simon Shuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYB140320&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/ | title=Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | work=The New York Review of Books | date=20 March 2014 | accessdate=22 July 2014 | last=Snyder |first= Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time accusing them of "Jewish influence" or spreading "gay propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2014/03/fascism-a-useful-insult/|title = Fascism: a useful insult|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Financial Times|last = Wagstyl|first = Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Marxist theories back up particular uses of fascism beyond its usual remit. For instance, [[Nicos Poulantzas|Poulantzas]]'s theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] could be associated with the idea of a [[military-industrial complex]] to suggest that 1960s America had a fascist social structure, though this kind of [[Maoism|Maoist]] or [[Guevarism|Guevarist]] analysis often underpinned the rhetorical depiction of Cold War authoritarians as fascists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Some Marxist groups – such as the Indian section of the [[Fourth International (post-reunification)|Fourth International]] and the [[Mansoor Hekmat#Views|Hekmatist]] groups in Iran and Iraq – have provided analytical accounts as to why the term "fascist" should be applied to groups such as the [[Hindutva]] movement, the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Iranian regime]] or the [[Islamism|Islamist]] sections of the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]]. Other scholars contend that the traditional meaning of the term fascism does not apply to Hindutva groups and may hinder an analysis of their activities.&lt;ref name="Refute"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://world.christianpost.com/article/20031219/1016.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113192335/http://world.christianpost.com/article/20031219/1016.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2006 |title=RSS neither Nationalist nor Fascist, Indian Christian priest's research concludes |publisher=[[The Christian Post]] |first=Surojit |last=Chatterjee |date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980823/23550294.html |title=RSS neither nationalist nor fascist, says Christian priest after research |publisher=[[The Indian Express]] |author=P.

'''Friulian literature''' is the [[literature]] of the autonomous [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Friuli]], written in the local [[Friulian language]].
Readers be aware that there is an alternative spelling for the adjective derived from Friuli: friulan, as influenced by the Veneto dialect form 'furlan'. The printed example of this is the ''Friulan Dictionary: English-Friulan, Friulan-English.'' edited by Gianni Nazzi &amp; Deborah Saidero and published by Ent Friul tal Mond, 2000.

Even if the first poems in Friulian date from the 14th century (anonymous works written in [[Cividale]] such as ''Piruç myò doç inculurit'' and ''Soneto furlan'', close to the Italian poetic movement [[Dolce Stil Novo]]), the birth of a full flavoured [[Friulian language|Friulian]] literature dates back only to the 19th century, when [[Friuli]], after the [[Congress of Vienna]], fell entirely under the control of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian empire]]. This late flourishing had several causes: first, the language of the culture and administration had never been Friulian, but [[Latin language|Latin]] and partly [[German language|German]] under the [[Patriarchal State of Aquileia]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], mixed with [[Venetian language|Venetian]] under the [[Republic of Venice|Serenissima]] rule.  Moreover, Friuli never saw the formation of a literate [[bourgeoisie]] that could have fostered the language, in order to have a literary development similar to other European languages. During the 16th century for example, there were only limited poetic forms in Friulian inspired by the works of [[Francesco Petrarca]], including the poems of [[Nicolò Morlupino]] from [[Venzone]] (1528-1570) and  [[Girolamo Biancone]] from [[Tolmezzo]] (1515-1580). Also, until 1800 there were no printed works in [[Friulian language|Friulian]], so the diffusion of poetry and other works was restricted to a small number of persons.

== 17th century ==
During this period, the most important Friulian authors were [[Eusebi Stele]] (''Eusebio Stella'') of [[Spilimbergo]] (1602-1671), born to a noble family, who composed poems in a playful and ironic style about his life and love adventures; and the count [[Ermes di Colorêt]] (1622-1692), notable mainly for his use of the ''koinè'' from [[Udine]], that would become the most notable literary language and the basis of today's standard Friulian. Ermes was educated at [[Medici]]'s court in [[Florence]], then took part in the [[Thirty Years' War]], worked in the service of the [[Venice|Venetian]] Republic and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I of Habsburg]]; in the last part of his life he returned to his homeland to focus on writing poetry, most of which centers on the theme of love.

== 18th century ==
This century was undoubtedly poor in the development of Friulian literature, probably due to the increasing influence of [[Venetian language]] in the city of [[Udine]]. Noteworthy, though, was the publication of the first Friulian [[almanac]] (''strolic'' or ''lunari'' in Friulian) in 1742.  The almanac contained short stories, poems and agricultural advice, with an item for each day of the year; these kinds of works would be very popular in the following centuries.

== 19th century ==
The first half of the century was similar to the previous one. The primary Friulian author of the 19th century, and today probably the best known in all of Friulian literature, was Pieri Çorut ([[Pietro Zorutti]], 1792–1867). Çorut's poetry was plain, far removed from the popular romanticism of the period; he devoted himself mainly to the almanacs, called ''Strolic furlans'', published yearly from 1821 until 1867. His most famous work is ''Plovisine'', composed in 1833. Çorut enjoyed great popularity in Friuli during his life and many tried to imitate his style. Today he is respected mainly for his usage of Central Friulian, which he sought to elevate to a literary language. Another author of almanacs was [[Antoni Broili]] (1796–1876), who achieved better results from the literary point of view.

In the second half of the century, the city of [[Gorizia]] was generally more vivacious than that of Udine; there was a different feeling of "Friulanity," and the environment was [[Mitteleuropa|mitteleuropean]], since the city (part of the county of [[Gorizia and Gradisca]]) was under the rule of Austro-Hungarian empire, while Udine was annexed to the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1866. In Gorizia, many tried to use the Friulian language in different fields, such as the applied sciences, with good results; one example from the period is the almanac ''Il me paîs. Strenna popolâr pal 1855'' by [[Federico de Comelli]] of [[Gradisca d'Isonzo|Gradisca]] (1826-1892). [[Carlo Favetti]] from Gorizia also published several books of poetry and plays in the local Friulian dialect.

An important literary event, although very late in comparison to other European languages, was the publication of the first Friulian vocabulary, composed by abbot [[Jacopo Pirona]] and his nephew Giulio Andrea (1871), which is still a valuable language resource today.  In 1873, [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] published an analysis of Friulian.  Ascoli started the so-called ''[[Questione Ladina]]''.

Also deserving of mention is [[Caterina Percoto]], who has an important role in [[Italian literature]] of this century, but who left only a few works in Friulian, mainly regarding popular traditions.

== 20th century ==
At the beginning of 1900 Friuli seemed far from the numerous avant-gardes of the period, at least in part due to its difficult historical situation; the regional request for autonomy received no response from the Italian authorities, and in 1933 the [[Italian fascism|fascist regime]] prohibited any publications in Friulian. The most important authors of this time were [[Vittorio Cadel]] of [[Fanna]] (1884-1917), who composed poems with a sensual background, concealing a deep feeling of sadness and discouragement; [[Ercole Carletti]] (1877-1946) of [[Udine]], author of poems in a style close to Italian ''crepuscolarismo''; and [[Celso Cescutti]]. A rare example of political and civil themes can be found in [[Giovanni Minut]]'s ''Rimis furlanis'' (1921).  Minut, born in [[Visco, Italy|Visco]] in 1895, was forced to flee to [[Uruguay]] when the fascists came to power; he died there in 1967.

In the area of [[Gorizia]], [[Delfo Zorzut]] of [[Cormons]] composed various collections of short stories (''La furlane'', ''Sturiutis furlanis'') and gathered many popular legends and traditions, useful to keep alive an interest in the language.

But the most important Friulian work of the 20th century was the ''Academiuta di lenga furlana'', founded by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].  Pasolini collected a group of writers in order to go beyond the old poetry inspired by [[Pieri Çorut]]'s works, which was still imitated, to create a new and modern Friulian poetry. Other noteworthy figures in the movement include Domenico Naldini (Pasolini's cousin) and Riccardo Castellani.  Neither, however, reached the poetical heights of their leader.  Their works were in the ''Concordiese'' dialect of Friulian, in polemic with the use of Central Friulian as the only literary standard.

Other developments after [[World War II]] included the lyrical works of [[Franco de Gironcoli]], from [[Gorizia]].  Gironcoli studied and analysed poems from [[Ermes di Colorêt]] and the Pirona vocabulary, and from 1944 on he composed several short lyrics, dedicated mainly to the flowing of time.

[[Josef Marchet]], a priest, began the difficult work of promoting and standardizing the language; he tried to arrange a  Friulian grammatic in ''Lineamenti di grammatica friulana,'' with the purpose of developing a standard variant of the language.  In 1950 he also published the collection ''Risultive,'' wherein were gathered the works of several interesting Friulian poets of the time (including [[Novella Cantarutti]] from [[Spilimbergo]]; Dino Virgili, composer of the novel ''L'aghe dapit la cleve''; and Lelo Cjanton (''Aurelio Cantoni'')).

1971 saw the publication of a translation with the title ''Prime di sere'' of the novel ''Il vento nel vigneto'', written in Italian by the Friulian writer [[Carlo Sgorlon]], which enjoyed a good success.

== 21st Century ==
While poets and song writers in Friuli continue to keep the language alive, Friulan has been used in Toronto, Canada, for many years by immigrants from Friuli. A notable example is the bilingual poem collection, ''From Friuli: Poems in Friulan, with English Translations,'' (2015) by Rina Del Nin Cralli and edited by Joseph Pivato. Rina is originally from Codroipo and said she was inspired to write poetry in Friulan by the books, ''Un Friul vivut in Canada'' (1977) by Ermanno Bulfon and ''A Furlan Harvest: An Anthology'' (1993) edited by Dore Michelut, an Italian-Canadian poet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">In [[algebraic number theory]], the '''Gras conjecture''' {{harv|Gras|1977}} relates the ''p''-parts of the Galois eigenspaces of an [[ideal class group]] to the group of global units modulo [[cyclotomic unit]]s. It was proved by {{harvtxt|Mazur|Wiles|1984}} as a corollary of their work on the [[main conjecture of Iwasawa theory]]. {{harvtxt|Kolyvagin|1990}} later gave a simpler proof using [[Euler system]]s.

The expression '''grüß Gott''' ({{IPA-de|ɡʁyːs ˈɡɔt}}; from ''grüß dich Gott'', originally '(may) God bless (you)')&lt;ref name=bairisch&gt;Hans Ulrich Schmid: [https://books.google.fi/books?id=hKxaOhH3cbwC&amp;pg=PT41&amp;lpg=PT41&amp;dq=Grüß+Gott+Bedeutung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w5l5MPeNZL&amp;sig=06MhtXQS8SHDo3sCt27MXQurCgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy_8mS_JTRAhXGKCwKHc_oCwkQ6AEIVzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Gr%C3%BC%C3%9F%20Gott%20Bedeutung&amp;f=false Bairisch: Das Wichtigste in Kürze] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[greeting]], less often a farewell, in [[Southern Germany]] and [[Austria]] (more specifically the [[Upper German]] [[Sprachraum]] especially in [[Bavaria]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Austria]], and [[South Tyrol]]). The greeting was promoted in the 19th century by the Catholic clergy and along with its variants has long been the most common greeting in Southern Germany and Austria. 

It is almost always misunderstood by speakers from other regions to mean the imperative ''greet God(!)'' and therefore often receives a sarcastic response from Northern (and thus mainly [[Protestant]]) Germans such as "If I see Him" ("Wenn ich ihn sehe") or "Hopefully not too soon" ("Hoffentlich nicht so bald"). ''Grüß Gott'' is however the shortened form of both ''(es) grüße dich Gott'' and its plural ''(es) grüße euch Gott'' (literally in modern German 'may God greet you'). In addition, in [[Middle High German]], the verb ''grüßen'' (''grüezen'') used to mean not only 'to greet' but also 'to bless', so the greeting in fact preserves the original meaning 'God bless you',&lt;ref name=bairisch/&gt; though even speakers in Southern Germany and Austria are only very rarely aware of this and think it means 'may God greet you'. 

Such a religious expression in a greeting only exists in a few countries. For example, people wish one another a simple 'good day' in Poland (''dzień dobry''), Spain (''buenos días''), and Portugal (''bom dia''), while in [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-speaking Ireland the popular greeting is ''Dia dhuit'' ('God with you'), similar to the English ''goodbye'', a contraction of ''God be with ye'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Goodbye Goodbye]. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; today, ''goodbye'' has a less obviously religious meaning. Also similar to the Catalan formal expression ''adéu-siau'' (''"be with God''", in archaic Catalan). A religious origin is still obvious in French ''adieu'', Spanish ''adiós'', Italian ''addio'', Portuguese ''adeus'', and Catalan ''adéu'' ("''to God''", probably a contraction of "''I entrust you to God''"). In [[Finland]], a religious group named [[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] uses the form "Jumalan terve" ("God's greeting").

Like many other greetings, ''grüß Gott'' can range in meaning from deeply emotional to casual or perfunctory. The greeting's pronunciation varies with the region, with, for example, ''grüß dich'' sometimes shortened to ''grüß di'' (the variation ''grüß di Gott'' may be heard in some places). In Bavaria and Austria ''griaß di'' and ''griaß eich'' are commonly heard, although their [[Standard German]] equivalents are not uncommon either. A common farewell analogous to ''grüß Gott'' is ''pfiat' di Gott'', a contraction of "behüte dich Gott" ('God protect you'), which itself is not common at all. This is likewise shortened this to ''pfiat' di/eich'' or, if the person is addressed formally&lt;ref&gt;''Höflichkeitsform'', using the word "Sie" for the second person singular and plural. This can be compared to the use of surnames instead of given names.&lt;/ref&gt; ''pfia Gott'' in [[Altbayern]], Austria, and [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italy]]).

In its standard German form, ''grüß Gott'' is mostly stressed on the second word and in many places is used not only in everyday life, but is also common in the official communications of the aforementioned states. Use of the greeting ''guten Tag'' ('good day') is less prevalent, but there are those who dislike ''grüß Gott'' on account of its religious nature. In Bavaria, ''guten Tag'' is considered prim and distant and sometimes leads to misunderstandings; however, if the person addressed is from Northern Germany, they may see it as a friendly gesture.

'''Juan S.P. Hidalgo Jr.''' (born July 12, 1936 in [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]), is an [[Ilocano language|Ilokano]] [[fiction]]ist ([[short story]], [[novel]]), [[poet]], [[literary editor|editor]], [[translator]], and [[Painting|painter]]. He was former managing editor of ''Bannawag'', a weekly Ilokano magazine. During his 37-year stint (1961–1998) as senior literary editor at ''Bannawag'', he guided, encouraged and trained young and old [[Ilokano writers]] to produce quality [[Iloko]] literary works. He was among the recipients of the first ever Philippine-International Theater Institute-[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] Award for Culture-Friendly Media Institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090327-196643/PDI-Read-Along-bags-another-award|title=PDI Read-Along bags another award|date=27 March 2009|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009171135/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090327-196643/PDI-Read-Along-bags-another-award|archivedate=9 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidalgo was responsible for the founding of [[GUMIL Filipinas]] (Gunglo dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano iti Filipinas).  The top national organization of Iloko writers, GUMIL now boasts of chapters in [[Guam]], [[Greece]], [[California]], and [[Hawaii]].

Considered by his peers as a "prodigy in [[Ilokano literature]]," Hidalgo published in 1969 the now classic Iloko anthology, ''"Bituen ti Rosales ken Dadduma Pay a Sarita"'' ''("Star of Rosales and Other Stories"),'' a collection of 20 selected short stories. This book became, as Iloko literary critics and scholars acknowledge, the "official textbook of contemporary Iloko writers" because of its influence on the serious Iloko writer.

As editor and translator, he published other anthologies of selected Iloko short stories; he translated a number of novels and short stories written in German or Japanese into Iloko. Even as he toiled as literary editor at ''Bannawag'' and saw to it that the quality of the literary output improved, he was able to publish in the magazine some 7 novels, 3 [[novella]]s, 4 biographies about the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and numerous poems, short stories and essays.

He started painting in 1979 and he was a founding member of the U.P. Campus Sunday Group, an association of painters at the [[University of the Philippines]]. His paintings were included in various art exhibits in [[Metro Manila]] and in the provinces.

Born in Intramuros, Manila, Hidalgo spent his childhood in [[Rosales, Pangasinan|Rosales]], [[Pangasinan]]. His parents were the late Juan Peralta Hidalgo of [[Dingras, Ilocos Norte|Dingras]], [[Ilocos Norte]] and Felisa Alberto Sanchez of Tomana, Rosales, Pangasinan.

He married Namnama Garma Prado of [[Piddig, Ilocos Norte|Piddig]], Ilocos Norte, a former head librarian at the [[University of the Philippines|UP-Diliman]]. They have three daughters: Maria Bituen (b. 1970), Patricia Amor (b. 1971), and Marie Sol (b. 1973).

'''Luís José Junqueira Freire''' (December 31, 1832 – June 24, 1855) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet and Benedictine [[monk]], adept of the "[[Ultra-Romanticism]]" movement and author of ''Inspirações do Claustro''. He is the patron of the 25th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
Luís José Junqueira Freire was born December 31, 1832 in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]], to José Vicente de Sá Freire and Felicidade Augusta Junqueira. After completing his primary studies and [[Latin]], he was matriculated at the Liceu Provincial of Salvador in 1849. Two years later, he joined the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] by family reasons. Although unsatisfacted living at the monastery, there he could write and read poetry, and served as a teacher.

He demanded his [[secularity]] in 1853, and, one year later, having obtained it, he refugiated at home, where he wrote his short ''Autobiography''. Shortly before dying, on June 24, 1855, due to heart problems he had since his childhood, Freire published the poetry anthology he wrote during his years at the Benedictines' monastery, called ''Inspirações do Claustro'' (in {{lang-en|Cloister Inspirations}}). The poems of it speak mostly of the solitude Freire suffered at the monastery, and also another subjects, such as [[celibacy]] horror; repressed desires who disturbed him and increased in him the wish to sin; the Brazilian [[nationalism]]; revolts against rules, the world and himself; obsession by death, and the ''[[mal du siècle]]''.

Some of Freire's poems have slight [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] traits; because of that, some critics consider him a forerunner of the [[Condorism]].

'''Kawahiva''' (Kawahíb, Kagwahib) is a [[Tupi–Guarani]] [[dialect cluster]] of [[Brazil]]. The major variety is '''Tenharin''' (Tenharin).

The [[Tenharin]], [[Parintintín]], [[Amondawa]], [[Uru-eu-wau-wau]] and [[Juma people|Júma]] peoples, along with a recently contacted group confusingly labeled "[[Nheengatu language|Karipuná]]" in the literature, all call themselves ''Kavahiva''. Their speech is all very similar, and also similar with other languages now extinct. [[Apiaká language|Apiaká]] (incl. Wiraféd) is very similar and may be a dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

'''L2 Syntactical Complexity Analyzer''' (L2SCA) developed by [[Xiaofei Lu]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]], is a computational tool which produces [[language complexity|syntactic complexity]] indices of written English language texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aihaiyang.com/software/l2sca/|title=L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Aihaiyang.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Coh-Metrix]], the L2SCA is one of the most extensively used computational tool to compute indices of [[second language writing]] development. The L2SCA is also widely utilised in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789401786447|title=Computational Methods for Corpus Annotation and Analysis|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L2SCA is available in a single and a batch mode. The first provides the possibility of analyzing a single written text for 14 syntactic complexity indices. The latter allows the user to analyze 30 written texts simultaneously.

==Usage==
===Second language writing development===
The L2SCA has been used in numerous studies in the field of second language writing development to compute indices of syntactic complexity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374315000417|title=Diane Mazgutova &amp; Judit Kormos: Syntactic and lexical development in an intensive English for Academic Purposes programme|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Journal of Second Language Writing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dujal.5.1.04loe|title=Junping Hou, Marjolijn Verspoor &amp; Hanneke Loerts: An exploratory study into the dynamics of Chinese L2 writing development|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Dutch Journal of Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/events/laelpgconference/papers/v08/Attila-M-Wind.pdf|title=Attila M.

===Corpus linguistics===
The L2SCA has also been used in various studies in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374315000405|title=Lu &amp; Ai: Syntactic complexity in college-level English writing: Differences among writers with diverse L1 backgrounds|date=September 2015|publisher=[[Science direct]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2017/general/paper37.pdf|title=Nasseri: A Corpus-based Analysis of Syntactic Complexity measures in the Academic Writing of EFL, ESL, and Native English Master’s Students|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Birmingham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in [[Times of India]] said that the state is home to three dozen languages including some that are nearly extinct, including [[Saimar language|Saimar]] which was spoken by only 4 people in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-17/mysore/32713218_1_ciil-saimar-speakers-tribal-languages |title=Saimar's oldest speaker appeals to protect his language |last=Milton| first= Lawrence|date= 17 July 2012| accessdate= 29 March 2013|newspaper= Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this Ranglong language is also under Tibeto-Burman family a Kuki-Chin language of India and Burma. It is also recorded as Langrong by UNESCO and declared as critically endangered language. Ranglong language is also known as "Riam chong", it is spoken in Seisimdung, Noagang, Zoitang, Lungkam, Zoinogor, Muolhui, Enhui, Vomthat, Kheuri-laikhuo, Rothabil, Laikhuo, Sorospur, Thumsip, Balidung, Ru-at, Saitha, Zarolian, villages in Tripura, Nurka, Langkhanphong, Pipla, Zairal, Sobiri, Khulicherra, Jugicherra, Salganga, Kaisanary, Jamira villages in Assam and Luimawi village in Mizoram. The Ranglong people lives in a close and compact yet divided by three Indian federal states, the Ranglong speakers as per G.A. Gierson in 1904 were 6266, in 2017 Ranglongs are 15000 approximately. Ranglong language is a tonal language, monosyllabic language, contextual language, agglutinative language, and ergative language, the Ranglong people have their own grammar book published by Mr. Reuben Ranglong on 5 July 2016 in memory of his father Mualzuiril Ranglong (Lt.) the first Ranglong Christian, who took baptized in 1956 in the Diamond Jubilee year (1956-2016). The grammar book "Ranglong Chongzia" written by Rev. Lianzamthang Ranglong and released by Mr. Ringpanjoy Ranglong, President of Ranglong Youth Association.

In 1880 G.H. Damant, the then Political Officer of Naga Hills, in his research paper, "Notes on the locality and Population of the Tribes Dwelling betweenthe Brahmaputra and Ningthi Rivers" in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Page 237, Published in Stanford University, USA, Put the Ranglong Community under Old Kuki.

C.A. Soppit (1887), the then Assistant Commissioner, Burma and Sub-Divisional Officer, North Cachar Hills, Assam, in his research works ‘A short Account of the Kuki-Lushai Tribe on the North-East Frontier’ published at Harvard University, USA, clearly mentioned about the community of Ranglong in his preface on the account of the tribes.

G.A. Grierson (1904), one of the most renowned linguistic scholars, in his extensive research works, ‘The Linguistic Survey of India, 1904’ in Volume III, Part III – ‘Tibeto-Burman family’ had identified the Ranglong as separate community and accordingly undertook detailed linguistic research on Ranglong language, as per his record in 1904, the Ranglong populations were about 6,266.

T.C Hodson (1911), the then Assistant Political Agent in Manipur and Superintendent of the State, in his book, ‘The Naga Tribes of Manipur’ published in University of London, also identified the Ranglong as separate community as against Halam, Rangkhol etc., and put it under Old Kuki group. It could be viewed in page 19.

Colonel Shakespeare (1912), in his extensive works on linguistic co-relation among various tribes namely ‘The Lushei Kuki Clan’ published in the University of California, highlighted Ranglong as distinct to other tribal languages, it could be viewed in page 227 &amp; 225.

Kenneth VanBik (2009), in his research works on, ‘Proto-Kuki-Chin: A Reconstructed Ancestor of the Kuki-Chin Language’ published in University of California, Berkeley, grouped the Ranglong with Old Kuki as against Halam Rangkhol, Aimol etc, it could be viewed in page 20.

M.K Bhasin (2006), in his research works, ‘Genetics of Castes and Tribes of India: Indian Population Milieu’ published in Int J Hum Genet, 2006, clearly identified the Ranglong as separate community alongside Lushai/Mizo, Rangkhol, Halam etc, it could be viewed in page 268, Volume 6(3).

'''Layla Bint Abullah Bin Shaddad Bin Ka’b Al Akheeliyya''' (d. c. AH 75/694×90/709 CE),&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of her date of death, Aram A. Shahin, 'Reflections of the Lives and Deaths of Two Umayyad Poets: Laylā al-Akhyaliyya and Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir', in ''The Heritage of Arabo-Islamic Learning: Studies Presented to Wadad Kadi'', ed. by Maurice A. Pomerantz, Aram A. Shahin (Leiden: Brill, 2016), pp. 398-443 (p. 399-414), DOI: 10.1163/9789004307469_018.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''Layla Al Akheeliyya''' (Ar. ليلى الأخيليّة) was a famous [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] [[poet]] who was renowned for her poetry, eloquence, strong personality as well as her beauty. Nearly fifty of her short poems survive. They include elegies for her lover Tawba ibn Humayyir and [[Uthman|‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Kate|editor1-last=Commire|editor1-first=Anne|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Yorkin Publications|location=Waterford, Connecticut|isbn=0-7876-4074-3|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591305237.html|chapter=Layla al-Akhyaliyya (fl. 650–660)|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'lewd satires' exchanged with the poet al-Nabigha al-Ja‘di; and panegyrics for leading Umayyad officials and caliphs: [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf]], Caliph [[Marwan I]], and Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]].&lt;ref name="Qutbuddin"/&gt;

==Life==
She was born to the [[Banu 'Uqayl]] section of the [[Banu 'Amir]] tribe, coincidentally the same tribe as [[Qays ibn al-Mullawah]] and Layla Al-Aamiriya. However, unlike them she was a city dweller not a [[bedouin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In her early years she was known for her love of Tawba ibn Humayyir but her father refused the marriage and she married a man called Abi Al-Athla’, Tawba continued to visit her despite her marriage until her husband complained to the [[Caliph]], who made Tawba leave. Her husband could not bear the [[jealousy]] so he divorced her. She then married an unknown poet and had many children, little is known about them.

==Poetry and Influence==
Her strong personality and fame gave her access to the [[Noble court|courts]] of the [[Umayyads]] and others.

She was one of the few early female Arab poets who dared to speak of her [[love]] in public; this poetry is particularly associated with Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir: 'Laylā and Tawba had fallen in love with each other. But when Tawba asked for Laylā's hand in marriage, her father refused, and married Laylā to another man. Later, Tawba was killed, and this inspired the laments of Laylā'.&lt;ref&gt;Aram A. Shahin, 'Reflections of the Lives and Deaths of Two Umayyad Poets: Laylā al-Akhyaliyya and Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir', in ''The Heritage of Arabo-Islamic Learning: Studies Presented to Wadad Kadi'', ed. by Maurice A. Pomerantz, Aram A. Shahin (Leiden: Brill, 2016), pp. 398-443 (p. 398), DOI: 10.1163/9789004307469_018.&lt;/ref&gt; What made this even more daring was that she was married to another ([[Sawwār b. Awfā al-Qushayrī]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aram A. Shahin, 'Reflections of the Lives and Deaths of Two Umayyad Poets: Laylā al-Akhyaliyya and Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir', in ''The Heritage of Arabo-Islamic Learning: Studies Presented to Wadad Kadi'', ed. by Maurice A. Pomerantz, Aram A. Shahin (Leiden: Brill, 2016), pp. 398-443 (p. 416 n. 48), DOI: 10.1163/9789004307469_018.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless love poetry was not her only [[genre]] as her poems were diverse in subjects although she avoided [[politics]]. This helped her to continue her relations with politically influential people despite changing times and powers. Here work includes exchanges of satires with [[Nābigha al-Ja‘dī]] (apparently between 40/660 and 63/683)&lt;ref&gt;Aram A. Shahin, 'Reflections of the Lives and Deaths of Two Umayyad Poets: Laylā al-Akhyaliyya and Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir', in ''The Heritage of Arabo-Islamic Learning: Studies Presented to Wadad Kadi'', ed. by Maurice A. Pomerantz, Aram A. Shahin (Leiden: Brill, 2016), pp. 398-443 (p. 416 n. 48), DOI: 10.1163/9789004307469_018.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ḥumayda bint Nu‘mān ibn Bashīr]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Schippers, 'The Role of Woman in Medieval Andalusian Arabic Story-Telling', in ''Verse and the Fair Sex: Studies in Arabic Poetry and in the Representation of Woman in Arabic Literature'', ed. by F. de Jong (Utrecht: M. Th. Houtsma Stichting, 1993), pp. 139-52 (p. 140), http://hdl.handle.net/11245/2.80595.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her poetry was often compared to that of [[Al-Khansa]].&lt;ref name="Qutbuddin"&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, [http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf 'Women Poets'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |date=2014-02-07 }}, in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 867.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Layla had more diverse imagery, not confined to the [[desert]], and used more than one genre, not confining herself to one subject. Her poetry also contained some philosophical aspects and [[wisdom]], usually attributed to her extensive travel. On the other hand, Layla depended highly on her poetry for income where she was awarded with money for some poems, and her poetry provided her with connections to rich and powerful people while Al-Khansa depended on her family’s traditional [[pastoralism]].

She died in 704 near the city of [[Samawa]] in [[Iraq]] while traveling.

Example of her poetry: 

::::::::أحــجاج لا يفـلل سلاحك إنما
المنـايا بكـف الله حيث تراها
::::::::إذا هبـط الحجاج أرضاً مريضة
تتبـع أقصـى دائـها فشفـاها
::::::::شفاها من الداء العضال الذي بها
غـلام إذا هـز القنـا سقـاها
::::::::سقاها دمــاء المارقين وعلـها
إذا جمحت يوماً وخفيـف أذاها
::::::::إذا سمـع الحجـاج صوت كتيبة
أعـد لها قبـل النـزول قراها

'''Mansim''', also known as '''Borai''' or '''Moi Brai''', is a [[West Papuan languages|West Papuan]] language language of the eastern [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] closely related to [[Hattam language|Hattam]]. As of 2010 there are rumours of 50 elderly speakers.&lt;ref name="Hammarström2015"/&gt;

== Phonology ==
Mansim has five vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/, and 16 consonants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50699329|title=Languages of the eastern Bird's Head|date=2002|publisher=Pacific linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University|others=Reesink, Ger P., Australian National University.

The status of /c, ɟ, h/ is uncertain, due to the single instance in the supporting text.

Like other Papuan languages, Mansim lacks a distinction between /r/ and /l/.

=== Stress ===
Mansim could have a tonal difference between homophones, since the various instances of ''bar'' ('something,' 'carry,' 'not') and ''tan'' ('inside,' 'far,' 'afraid') could need the use of a different pitch, but this is not seen in the data, although it is restricted. Stress seems to be placed in an iambic pattern over the clause, with stress placed on the second syllable. This means that person prefixes and first syllables of polysyllabilic words, with the exception of full personal pronouns, are unstressed. Citation markers and possessive pronouns can be stressed, but major categories like nouns and verbs do not necessarily attract main stress.

== Grammar ==
The basic word order of Mansim is [[Subject–object–verb|SOV (subject-object-verb)]]. In the noun phrase, the possessive pronoun is after the nominal position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Microdistrict''', or '''microraion''' ({{lang-ru|микрорайо́н}}, ''mikrorajón''; {{lang-be|мікрараён}}, ''mikrarajon''; {{lang-uk|мікрорайон}}, {{lang-hy|միկրոշրջան|mikrošrǯan}}), is a residential complex—a primary structural element of the [[residential area]] construction in the [[Soviet Union]] and in some [[post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] and former Communist states. Residential districts in most of the cities and towns in Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union were built in accordance with this concept.

According to the Construction Rules and Regulations of the Soviet Union, a typical microdistrict covered the area of 10–60&amp;nbsp;[[hectare]]s (30–160&amp;nbsp;acres), up to but not exceeding 80&amp;nbsp;hectares (200&amp;nbsp;acres) in some cases, and comprised residential dwellings (usually multi-story [[apartment building]]s) and public service buildings. As a general rule, major motor roads, [[green belt|greenways]], and natural obstacles served as boundaries between microdistricts, allowing an overall reduction in city road construction and maintenance costs and emphasizing [[public transportation]]. Major motor roads or through streets were not to cross microdistricts' territories. The entrances to a microdistrict's territory were to be located no further than 300&amp;nbsp;meters (1000&amp;nbsp;ft) apart.

Standards also regulated the accessibility of the public service buildings (excluding schools and pre-school facilities) by imposing a 500-meter (1,500–foot) limit as the farthest distance from any residential dwelling. One of the city-planners' tasks was to ensure that the fewest public buildings were built to cover the microdistrict's territory in accordance with the norms. Typical public service structures include [[high school|secondary schools]], pre-school establishments (usually combined [[kindergarten]] and [[Nursery school|nursery]]), grocery stores, personal service shops, [[cafeteria]]s, clubs, [[playground#Playgrounds in the Soviet Union|playgrounds]], and building maintenance offices, as well as a number of specialized shops. The exact number of buildings of each type depended on the distance requirement and the microdistrict's population density and was determined by means of certain per capita standards.

==History==
===1920s–1950s===
The history of microdistricts as an urban planning concept dates back to the 1920s when the Soviet Union experienced a very fast rate of [[urbanization]]. Under the [[Soviet urban planning ideologies of the 1920s]], residential complexes—compact territories with residential dwellings, schools, shops, entertainment facilities, and [[green belt|green spaces]]—started to prevail in urban planning practices as they allowed for more careful and efficient planning of the rapid spatial expansion. These complexes were seen as an opportunity to build a collective society,&lt;ref name="van Dijk"&gt;Ir. M.H.H. van Dijk, IsoCaRP Congress 2003, ''Planning and politics''&lt;/ref&gt; an environment suitable and necessary for the new way of life.&lt;ref name="Gentile"&gt;Michael Gentile, Dept. of Social and Economic Geography, [[Uppsala University]], ''Urbanism and Disurbanism in the Soviet Union''[http://www.student.uu.se/studorg/europe/inblick/?p=/2articles/04/gentile.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, residential complexes grew in size, covering territories of up to five to six hectares. A system of building residential complexes was gradually replaced with a concept of a [[city block]]. Such blocks generally comprised residential buildings along the perimeter, and residential buildings intermingled with public service buildings in the inner area. However, it was unfeasible to provide all public services within every city block due to the latter's relatively compact size, so it was not unusual when a school, a kindergarten, or a store served the population of several blocks, which were often separated by major motor roads. The system of the city blocks also required a developed network of roads, thus increasing the maintenance and construction costs and complicating organization of the public transportation.

1940s and 1950s saw further enlargement and grouping of the city blocks. However, new construction was based on the same principles as in the previous decades and could not keep up with the increasing housing demand. Labor-intensive industrialization of the country demanded more workers, which was hard to achieve with housing accommodations lacking.&lt;ref name="van Dijk" /&gt;

===1950s–1990s===
Soviet authorities revisited issues of urban planning in the mid-1950s. The new urban planning concept built on the concept of residential districts (with 10,000–30,000 inhabitants each), consisting of several microdistricts (with 8,000–12,000 inhabitants each), which in their turn comprised several residential complexes (with 1,000–1,500 inhabitants each). In larger cities, residential districts were grouped into urban zones, the population of which could reach one million. Each microdistrict provided the population with facilities needed on a daily basis, whereas services in lesser demand were available on the residential-district level. This concept was backed up with reorganization of the Soviet construction industry—[[tower block|panel-block apartment buildings]] became widespread as they allowed for fast, although often low-quality, construction, reduced costs, and economies of scale. The whole construction process became simplified and standardized, leading to the erection of the rows and rows of faceless grey rectangular apartment-buildings which now prevail in every city and town of the countries of the former Soviet Union. Such drastic reduction of building costs was necessary because flats in the new blocks were given to the citizens free of charge at the time. Humorous insights into the potential consequences of living in such a bland and repetitive atmosphere appear in the hugely popular [[Mosfilm]] production ''[[The Irony of Fate]]'' (1976).

===Modern times===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a sharp decline in the volume of residential construction. During the 1990s, urban planning was mostly ignored as there was virtually no new construction. 2000s brought slow growth to the volume of housing construction, as well as heightened criticisms of the microdistrict model. Urban planning, no longer the direct responsibility of central governments, was delegated to the regions; some (including Ukraine and Moldova) of which are now coping with the task of maintaining deteriorating Soviet-era housing assets. Since the mid-2000s, many apartment blocks have either been modernised or replaced with modern skyscrapers.

==China==
[[File:昭苑小区 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Entrance gate to a modern Xiaoqu]]
In China, this type of neighbourhood unit is known as Xiaoqu ({{zh|s=小区|p=xiǎoqū}}). First built in the 1980s, preceding the [[Chinese economic reform]], they were very similar to the concept as known in the Soviet Union. Xiaoqu similarly promoted a sense of community among the inhabitants. However, after the economy was opened up more for commercial real estate developers, Xiaoqu continued to be built, but evolved in several ways such as differentiation in luxury, safety and available services. The apartments are owned by the inhabitants, and the Xiaoqu is often enclosed by a wall, with the [[Gated community|entrance gate]] being guarded.&lt;ref name="Bray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bray|title=Social Space and Governance in Urban China: The Danwei System from Origins to Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruoXr97uXvsC&amp;pg=PA177|year=2005|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-5038-7|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Wallenwein |first=Fabienne |date= 9 December 2013 |title=The Housing Model xiaoqu 小区: the Expression of an Increasing Polarization of the Urban Population in Chinese Cities? |type= |chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/17143/1/The%20Housing%20Model%20xiaoqu_Wallenwein.pdf |access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Synoptic Theory MS en.svg|315px|right|frame|Simplified diagram of the core premise in most variants of the multi-source hypothesis.]]

The '''Multi-source hypothesis''' is a proposed solution to the [[synoptic problem]], holding that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] are not directly interdependent but have each drawn from a distinct combination of earlier documents. It encompasses a family of theories differing in the particulars of the nature and relationships of these earlier documents.

An early form of the theory was proposed by Marsh over two centuries ago.{{sfn|Marsh|1823|pp=167-409}} More recently, Boismard proposed a structurally similar theory,{{sfn|Boismard|1979|pp=1-17}} which was further developed by Rolland{{sfn|Rolland|1984|p=136|ps=&amp;nbsp;Rolland hypothesizes a proto-Matthew source originally composed in Hebrew}} and Burkett.{{sfn|Burkett|2004|pp=141-2|ps=&amp;nbsp;Burkett hypothesizes a proto-Mark source originally composed in Greek}}

According to these theories, the common material among the three synoptic gospels ultimately derives from a proto-gospel somewhat like Mark. This proto-gospel underwent two independent revisions, ''A'' and ''B''. Mark was formed by recombining these two revisions. Matthew built upon ''A'' and Luke upon ''B''. Both Matthew and Luke also drew from a common source ''[[Q source|Q]]'', as well as other source sources for their unique material.

'''N. S. Madhavan''' (born 9 September 1948) is a leading writer of contemporary [[Malayalam literature]], whose short stories, novels, football columns and travel articles enjoy a wide readership in [[Malayalam]] speaking areas of India.

==Early life==
Madhavan was born in the port city of [[Kochi|Cochin]] where he attended the [[Sree Rama Varma High School]].&lt;ref name="Author Details"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookandborrow.com/AuthorDetails.asp?autID=2667 |title=Author Details |date=2017-08-19 |access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in economics from [[Maharaja's College, Ernakulam|Maharajas College]], [[Ernakulam]] he moved to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] to study for his masters at the Department of Economics, [[University of Kerala]]. During this period he began writing, and in 1970 won the top prize for his first published short story 'Sisu', in a contest organised by the Malayalam literary magazine [[Mathrubhumi]]. In 1975, Madhavan joined the [[Indian Administrative Service]] where he was seconded to the [[Bihar]] cadre. His civil service career followed the usual path of initially administering sub-districts and districts, then jobs in the state and union secretariats followed by the running departments and corporations.&lt;ref name="kayataran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayataran.com/behindscenes/madhavan.htm|title=Kaya Taran - Sashi Kumar|website=kayataran.com|accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
[[File:എന്‍.എസ് മാധവന്‍.jpg|thumbnail|N.S Madhavan]]
In the 1980s, Madhavan went through a decade-long period of [[writer's block]], until the release of his story 'Higuita' in 1990. In this work, Madhavan models his protagonist, priest Father Geevarghese, on [[René Higuita]], the 1990 FIFA World Cup goalkeeper for Colombia. Higuita's unconventional playing style whereby he would often abandon his goal and try to score goals, occupies the priest's imagination. Likewise, he temporarily abandons his cassock and saves a tribal girl Lucie from the clutches of the trafficker Jabbar. The short story was adjudged [http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/column_the-world-is-round-and-so-is-a-football_1393735 the best in hundred years] of Malayalam literature.

Since then he has published four collections of stories, a novel and one collection of plays. Among the stories, ‘Thiruthu’, based on the [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid|Babri masjid demolition]], is particularly notable. Madhavan's works of short fiction are:
*''Chulaimedile Savangal'' (Corpses of Chulaimed)
*''Higuita''
*''Thiruth'' (Blue Pencil)
*''Paryaya Kathakal'' (Stories about Names)
*''Nilavili'' (The Cry)
Madhavan's contribution to the short story genre, which is dying in most parts of the world, is reckoned by critics to be unique and noteworthy. As a short-fiction writer, his art gives importance to minute details and exemplifies the manifest skill and compact craft that writing short fiction demands. In Madhavan's works the subtle connections of criss-crossing dialogues and interlacing plots ultimately reveal an integrated narrative continuum.

==Novel==
After thirty-three years as a writer, Madhavan published his debut novel in 2003 as ''Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal'', translated as ''Litanies of the Dutch Battery'' in 2010. It was well received by Malayalam readers and has been reprinted many times. The novel is about life on an imaginary island in the Kochi backwater, named after a 17th-century battery (''bathery'' in Malayalam) of five cannons installed on its promontory by the Dutch (''Lanthans'' in Malayalam). Jessica, the young narrator of the story, is the scion of a family of carpenters with a long tradition of boat building. Her remniscences start from the days when she was inside her pregnant mother's womb. The novel presents an intimate picture of life of the Latin Christians of the Kerala coast, descendants of poor, low-caste Hindus who were converted to Christianity by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century.

The novel it is set between 1951 and 1967, the first sixteen years of Jessica life, but draws upon history going back to the time of [[Vasco Da Gama]]. She was born at a time when people used to run away from cow-pox vaccinators as well as the period when Kerala embraced communism, which the novelist calls the 'watermelon years' – an allusion to the verdant green-canopied Kerala with its hidden red watermelons. There are captivating descriptions of Latin Christian residents of the Dutch Battery preparing themselves for months prior to the staging of Karalman [[Chavittu Nadakam]], an operatic play about [[Charlemagne]], originally written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and pidgin [[Latin]] by Chinnathambi Annavi in the 16th century. Set against the background of the city of Madhavan's birth, Kochi, the ''Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal'' is a roller coaster ride through micro histories, the nascent days of a newly independent country, the growth and decline of ideas, and the randomness of events affecting human lives. Well-known Malayalam novelist [[M. Mukundan]] made the following assessment after reviewing the novel, "N.S. Madhavan has rejuvenated Malayalam fiction."&lt;ref name="Muk"&gt;''[[M. Mukundan]] Epic Imagination: Review of Lanthanbatheriyile Luthinayakal'', The Little Magazine, New Delhi: Volume IV, Issue 4 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He summarises the novel thus: "[The book] is all about history and imagination—the protogonists of new fiction that is in vogue."&lt;ref name="Muk" /&gt; Mukundan added, "The novel is heavily populated with communists, priests, carpenters, cooks, boatmen, librarians, school teachers, even tailors. At times you will come across history makers from faraway Russia – [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Imre Nagy]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]]..."&lt;ref name="Muk" /&gt;

The English translation was shortlisted for the 2011 [[The Hindu Literary Prize]], translated by Rajesh Raja Mohan.

===Plays===
In 2006, Madhavan published his first book of plays:
*''Randu Natakangal''

==English translation==
Madhavan's novel ''Lanthanbatheriyile Luthiniyakal'' was translated into English by [[Rajesh Rajamohan]] under the title ''Litanies of Dutch Battery'' and published in October 2010 by Penguin Books. It was selected for the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]] long list, and was the winner of the 2010 [[Vodafone Crossword Book Award]] (Fiction Translation).

==Filmography==
[[When Big Tree Falls|When Big Trees Fall]], a short story by Madhavan, is about the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|homicidal attacks on the Sikhs]] that occurred following the 1984 assassination of the then Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and has been filmed as the [[Hindi movie]], ''[[Kaya Taran]]'' by [[Sashi Kumar]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="N S Madhavan - Author of 'When Big Trees Fall'"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kayataran.com/behindscenes/madhavan.htm |title=N S Madhavan - Author of 'When Big Trees Fall' |date=2017-08-19 |access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Madhavan is married to Sheela Reddy, book editor of ''Outlook'', an English magazine published in New Delhi. Their daughter, [[Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan]] is a well-known blogger and the author of 2 English novels, ''You Are Here'', ''Confessions of a Listmaniac'' and the best-seller Cold Feet.

'''Neo-Aristotelianism''' is a view of [[literature]] and [[rhetorical criticism]] propagated by the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]]&lt;ref&gt;James P. Beasley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ocq0I7PbxiAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Prehistory of Rhetoric and Composition: New Rhetoric and Neo-Aristotelianism at the University of Chicago, 1947--1959]'', ProQuest, 2007, pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others &amp;mdash; which means.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Neo-Aristotelianism.html
Definition from The University of Toronto National Library&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central features were first suggested in [[Herbert Wichelns|Herbert A. Wichelns]]' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Herbert A.|last=Wichelns|author-link=Herbert Wichelns|editor-last=Drummond|editor-first=Alexander M.|title=The Literary Criticism of Oratory|encyclopedia=Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brigance|first=William Norwood|title=A History and Criticism of American Public Address|year=1943|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss.|first=Sonja K|title=. Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Aristotelianism "led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Literary Criticism of Oratory"==&lt;!-- The article Herbert Wichelns links here --&gt;
Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:
* Speaker's personality 
* Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) 
* [[Audience]] 
* Major ideas 
* Motives to which the speaker appealed 
* Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) 
* Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience 
* Arrangement 
* [[Stylistics (field of study)|Mode of expression]] 
* Speech preparation 
* Delivery 
* Effect of the [[discourse]] on the immediate audience and long-term effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichelns|first=Herbert A.|title="The Literary Criticisms of Oratory," in Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" provided "substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyn|first=Mark S.|title="Toward a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism," in Essays on Rhetorical Criticism|year=1968|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Donald C.|title=The Rhetorical Idiom: Essays in Rhetoric, Oratory, Language, and Drama|year=1958|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41782">The '''political views of American academics''' began to receive attention in the 1930s, and investigation into faculty political views expanded rapidly after the rise of [[McCarthyism]]. Demographic surveys of faculty that began in the 1950s and continue to the present have found higher percentages of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] than of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], particularly among those who work in the humanities and social sciences. Researchers and pundits disagree about survey methodology and about the interpretations of the findings.

==History==
===Pre- and post-WWII===
[[File:Max Yergan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Max Yergan]] was one of the first professors fired for political views.]]
Carol Smith&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Smith, Carol. (2011). "[https://www.aaup.org/article/dress-rehearsal-mccarthyism?PF=1 The dress rehearsal for McCarthyism]." ''Academe'' 94(4): 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Leberstein&lt;ref name="Leber92"&gt;Stephen Leberstein, "Purging the Profs: The Rapp Coudert Committee in New York, 1940–1942," in Michael E. Brown et al. (eds.), ''New Studies in the Politics and Culture of US Communism.'' New York: Monthly Review Press, 1993; p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; have documented investigations of professors' political views at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) during the 1930s and 1940s. Citing the tactics of private hearings, requiring respondents to name others, and denying rights of legal representation, Smith calls the investigations a "dress rehearsal for McCarthyism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Smith described the case of [[Max Yergan]], who was the first African American professor hired at the CCNY. After complaints that he expressed liberal and progressive views in his classes on Negro History and Culture, Yergan was terminated in 1936.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1938, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] created the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]; one of the committee's first actions was to attempt to investigate the political views of faculty in the [[City University of New York|New York public colleges]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1940, [[Bertrand Russell]] was denied employment as a philosophy professor at CCNY because of his political beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That same year, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the [[Rapp-Coudert Committee|Rapp-Coutert Committee]], which held hearings in 1940–41 during which faculty accused of holding [[Communism|communist]] political beliefs were interrogated.&lt;ref name="Leber92" /&gt; More than 50 faculty and staff at CCNY resigned or were terminated as a result of the hearings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leber92" /&gt; One professor, [[Morris Schappes]], served a year in prison for refusing to name colleagues who may have been affiliated with the [[Communist Party USA|Community party]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Smith believes that the investigations caused the largest political purge on one campus in the history of the US.

In 1942, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), began investigating the political views of [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B.

Although the investigation was dismissed, Atlanta University fired DuBois in 1943. Public outcry led the university to reinstate DuBois, but he retired in 1944. In 1949, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] summoned faculty members from the [[University of Washington]], and three [[Academic tenure|tenured]] faculty members were fired.&lt;ref name="Schrecker" /&gt;

===McCarthyism and loyalty oaths===
{{main|McCarthyism}}
[[File:Senator Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph McCarthy]]'s hearings led to faculty members being pressured to resign.]] 
Although government employees and entertainment figures were most often investigated for alleged communist sympathies during the "[[Red Scare#Second Red Scare|Second Red Scare]]" of the 1950s, many university faculty were accused as well.&lt;ref name="Schrecker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/schrecker.html|title=Political Tests for Professors: Academic Freedom during the McCarthy Years|first=Ellen|last=Schrecker|date=October 7, 1999|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 1955 study of 2,451 social scientists who taught at American colleges and universities, Lazarsfeld and Thielens noted that the period of 1945–55 was especially marked by suspicion and attacks on colleges for the political views of their faculty.

In 1950, the [[Regents of the University of California|University of California Board of Regents]] and its administration began to require faculty to sign a two-part political [[loyalty oath]]: one part required faculty to declare they were not Communists, and did not believe in the tenets of Communism;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Radin, Max.

==Surveys==

===Ford Foundation===
In 1955, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] led an effort within the [[Ford Foundation]] to document and analyze the effects of [[McCarthyism]] on [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name=Gross1&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-VLm9EcghoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=2013|isbn=9780674059092}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25–27}} He commissioned sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] to conduct a study of university faculty in the United States, and the results were published by Lazarsfeld and Wagner Thielens in a book, ''[[The Academic Mind]]''. As part of a survey of faculty views about academic freedom during the "Second Red Scare", they asked 2,451 professors of social science a large number of questions, and found that about two thirds of these faculty members had been visited by the FBI and had been asked questions about the political beliefs of their colleagues, students, and themselves.&lt;ref name="Keen"/&gt;{{rp|xvii}} They also included a few questions about political party affiliations and recent voting patterns, and reported that there were more [[History of the United States Democratic Party#Presidency of Harry S.

===Carnegie Commission on Higher Education===
The Lazarsfeld and Thielens study had examined a sample of 2451 social science faculty members.&lt;ref name="LazarsfeldThielens1958" /&gt; A second study, conducted in 1969 on behalf of the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Commission on Higher Education]], was the first to be performed with a large survey sample, extensive questions about political views, and what Neil Gross characterized as highly rigorous analytic methods.&lt;ref name=Gross1/&gt;{{rp|28–30}} The study was conducted in 1969 by political scientist [[Everett Carll Ladd]] and sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], who surveyed 60,000 academics in multiple fields of study at 303 institutions about their political views.&lt;ref name=Gross1/&gt;{{rp|28–30}} Publishing their results in the 1975 book ''[[The Divided Academy]]'', Ladd and Lipset found that about 46% of professors described themselves as liberal, 27% described themselves as moderates, and 28% described themselves as conservative. They also reported that faculty in the humanities and social sciences tended to be the most liberal, while those in "applied professional schools such as nursing and home economics" and in agriculture were the most conservative. Younger faculty tended to be more liberal than older faculty, and faculty across the political spectrum tended to disapprove of the [[Student activism#United States|student activism]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="LaddLipset1975"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Everett Carll Jr Ladd|author2=Seymour Martin Lipset|title=The Divided Academy: Professors and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwGcAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-010112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zipp"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zipp, John F. |author2=Fenwick, Rudy |title=Is the Academy a Liberal Hegemony?: The Political Orientations and Educational Values of Pr ofessors |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=January 2006 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=304–326 |doi=10.1093/poq/nfj009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross1/&gt;{{rp|28–30}}

Smaller follow-up surveys on behalf of the Carnegie Foundation held in 1975, 1984, 1989, and 1997 showed an increased trend among professors toward the left, apart from a small movement to the right in 1984.

====Higher Education Research Institute====
Beginning in 1989, the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] (HERI) at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] has conducted a survey of full-time faculty at American four-year colleges and universities every three years.&lt;ref name="Zipp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross1"/&gt;{{rp|31}} The HERI Faculty Survey gathers comprehensive information about the faculty experience, such as position, field, institutional details, and personal opinion and views, including a single question asking respondents to self-identify their political orientation as "far left", "liberal", "moderate/middle of the road", "conservative", or "far right". Between 1989 and 1998, the survey showed negligible change in the number of professors who described themselves as far left or liberal, approximately 45%. {{as of|2014}}, surveying 16,112 professors, the percentage of liberal/far left had increased to 60%.&lt;ref name="HERI1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Astin, A.W. |author2=Korn, W.S. |author3=Dey, E.L. |title=The American College Teacher: National Norms for 1989-90 HERI Faculty Survey report |date=May 1990 |publisher=[[Higher Education Research Institute]] |page=44 |url=https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/FAC/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanCollegeTeacher1989To1990.pdf |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HERI1999"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sax, L.J. |author2=Astin, A.W. |author3=Korn, W.S. |author4=Gilmartin, S.K. |title=The American College Teacher: National Norms for 1998-99 HERI Faculty Survey report |date=September 1999 |isbn=1878477242 |page=61 |url=https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/FAC/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanCollegeTeacher1998To1999.pdf |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HERI2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eagan, M.

====North American Academic Survey Study====
Ladd and Lipset, who had conducted the original Carnegie survey, designed a telephone survey in 1999 of approximately 4000 faculty, administrators, and students, called the North American Academic Survey Study (NASS).&lt;ref name="Academe"/&gt; [[Stanley Rothman]], the project lead after the passing of Ladd and Lipset, published a paper using NAASS data along with Neil Nevitte and [[Samuel Robert Lichter|S.

====Politics of the American Professoriate====
Neil Gross and Solon Simmons conducted a survey starting in 2006 called the ''Politics of the American Professoriate'' which led to several study papers and books. They designed their survey to improve on past studies which they felt had not included [[community college]] professors, addressed low response rates, or used standardized questions. The survey drew upon a sample size of 1417 full-time professors from 927 institutions.&lt;ref name="GrossSimmons2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JaschikOct2007"/&gt;

In 2007, Gross and Simmons concluded in ''The Social and Political Views of American Professors'' that the professors were 44% liberal, 46% moderates, and 9% conservative.&lt;ref name="GrossSimmons2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross|first1=Neil|authorlink1=Neil Gross |last2=Simmons|first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |journal=(working paper) |date=September 24, 2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrossSimmons2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gross|editor1-first=N.|editor2-last=Simmons|editor2-first=S. |title=Professors and Their Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1vCAwAAQBAJ |chapter=The Social and Political Views of American College and University Professors |last1=Gross|first1=Neil|authorlink1=Neil Gross |last2=Simmons|first2=Solon |date=29 May 2014|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=978-1-4214-1334-1|lccn=2013035780}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25–26}} ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' reported that economist [[Lawrence H. Summers]] made his own analysis of the data collected by Gross and Simmons and found a larger gap among faculty teaching "core disciplines for undergraduate education" at elite research universities, but the report also concluded that "there was widespread praise for the way the survey was conducted, with Summers and others predicting that their data may become the definitive source for understanding professors' political views."&lt;ref name="JaschikOct2007"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jaschik |first1=Scott |title=The Liberal (and Moderating) Professoriate |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/08/liberal-and-moderating-professoriate |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |date=October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross published a more extensive analysis in his 2013 book ''Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?''&lt;ref name="Gross1"/&gt; and, with Simmons, in their 2014 compilation ''Professors and Their Politics''.&lt;ref name="GrossSimmons2014"/&gt;{{rp|25–26}} They strongly criticized what they saw as conservative political influence on the interpretation of data about faculty political views, arising from activists and [[think tank]]s seeking political reform of American higher education.&lt;ref name="GrossSimmons2014"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Sociologist Joseph Hermanowicz described ''Professors and Their Politics'' as "a welcome addition to sociological literature examining higher education, which, in the case of its intersection with politics, has not received serious attention since Paul Lazarsfeld and Wagner Theilen's classic study of 1958 and Seymour Martin Lipset and Everett Carll Ladd's 1976 work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/682889|title=Professors and Their Politics.

====Regional and disciplinary variations====
[[File:Steven Pinker 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Steven Pinker]] has advocated for more acceptance of political diversity in the social sciences.]]
Several studies have found that the political views of academics vary considerably between different regions of the United States, and between academic disciplines. In a 2016 opinion column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', for example, political scientist Samuel J. Abrams used HERI data to argue that the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty varied greatly between regions. According to Abrams, the ratio of liberal to conservative professors was highest in [[New England]], where this ratio was 28:1, compared to 6:1 nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/sunday/there-are-conservative-professors-just-not-in-these-states.html|title=Opinion.

The data clearly reveal that conservative faculty are not only as satisfied with their career choice – if not more so – as their liberal counterparts, but that these faculty are also as progressive in their teaching methods and maintain almost identical outlooks toward their personal and professional lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312229229_The_Contented_Professors_How_Conservative_Faculty_See_Themselves_within_the_Academy|title=The Contented Professors: How Conservative Faculty See Themselves within the Academy|first=Samuel|last=Abrams|date=December 2016|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell Langbert examined variations in political party registration in 2018, describing a higher concentration of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in elite liberal arts institutions in the northeast, and found more Democrats among female faculty than male faculty. He also found the greatest ratio of Democrats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in interdisciplinary studies and the humanities, and the lowest ratio in professional studies and science and engineering.&lt;ref name="Langbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langbert |first1=Mitchell |title=Homogeneous: The Political Affiliations of Elite Liberal Arts College Faculty |journal=[[Academic Questions]] |volume=32|issue=2|pages=186 |publisher=[[National Association of Scholars]] |url=https://www.nas.org/articles/homogenous_political_affiliations_of_elite_liberal|accessdate=June 13, 2018 |date=June 2018|doi=10.1007/s12129-018-9700-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing specifically on social psychology academics, a 2014 study found that "[b]y 2006, however, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans had climbed to more than 11:1."&lt;ref name="BBS"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Political diversity will improve social psychological science |first1=José L.|last1=Duarte |first2=Jarret T.|last2=Crawford |first3=Charlotta|last3=Stern |first4=Jonathan|last4=Haidt|authorlink4=Jonathan Haidt |first5=Lee|last5=Jussim|authorlink5=Lee Jussim |first6=Philip E.|last6=Tetlock|authorlink6=Philip E.

Since the modern [[conservatism in the United States|conservative movement in the United States]] began in the mid-20th century, conservative authors have argued that college students are unduly influenced or [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] as a result of the prevalence of liberal faculty at their schools.&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nash |first1=George H. |authorlink1=George H.

Hewitt published in 2008 examined ideological changes in college students between their first and senior years and found that these changes correlated with that of most Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 during the same time period, and there was no evidence that faculty ideology was "associated with changes in students' ideological orientation" and concluded that students at more liberal schools "were not statistically more likely to move to the left" than students at other institutions. Similarly, Stanley Rothman, April Kelly-Woessner, and Mathew Wossner found in 2010 that students' "aggregate attitudes do not appear to vary much between their first and final years," and wrote that this "raises some questions about charges that campuses politically indoctrinate students."&lt;ref name="RothmanKelly-Woessner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley Rothman|author2=April Kelly-Woessner|author3=Matthew Woessner|title=The Still Divided Academy: How Competing Visions of Power, Politics, and Diversity Complicate the Mission of Higher Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PPJdzcf7rAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-0808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77–78}} Analysis of a survey of students' political attitudes by [[M.

===On faculty===
[[File:Lawrence Summers 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Lawrence Summers]] has said: "As someone who is a strong Democrat and is a liberal, and does not think that we have won the argument with the country over the last 40 years, rather to the contrary, it makes me wonder whether if you do not engage in intense dialogue with those whom you disagree with... whether your own arguments will be sharpened and honed to maximum effect."&lt;ref name="JaschikOct2007"/&gt;]]

Rothman, Kelly-Woessner, and Woessner also found in 2010 that 33% of conservative faculty say they are "very satisfied" with their careers, while 24% of liberal faculty say so. Over 90% of Republican-voting professors said that they would still become professors if they could do it all over again. The authors concluded that, although such numbers are not definitive as to how faculty members feel that they have been treated, they provide some evidence against the idea that conservative faculty members are systematically discriminated against.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RothmanKelly-Woessner2010"/&gt;{{rp|102}} Woessner and Kelly-Woessner also examined what might have given rise to the differences in the numbers of liberals and conservatives. They looked at the choices made by undergraduate students when planning future careers. They found that there were no differences in intellectual ability between conservative and liberal students, but that liberal students were significantly more likely to choose to pursue PhD degrees and academic careers, whereas conservative students of identical academic accomplishments were more likely to pursue business careers. They concluded that the greater numbers of liberal than conservative professors could be accounted for by self-selection in career paths, rather than by bias in hiring or promotion.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marranto"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Matthew|last1=Woessner|first2=April|last2=Kelly-Woessner|editor-first1=Robert|editor-last1=Marranto|editor-first2=Richard E.|editor-last2=Redding|editor-first3=Frederick M.|editor-last3=Hess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLD0HGrvtxAC|title=The Politically Correct University: Problems, Scope, and Reforms|chapter=Left Pipeline: Why Conservatives Don't Get Doctorates|publisher=The AEI Press|date=2009|isbn=9780844743172|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–55}}

[[Lawrence Summers]] said at a symposium about ''The Social and Political Views of American Professors'' that he considers it a problem that some academics express an "extreme hostility" to conservative opinions. He observed that faculty who were invited to give [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values]] were almost always liberals, and expressed concern that an imbalance in political representation at universities could impede rigorous examination of issues. He also attributed the small numbers of conservative professors largely to the career choices made by people comparing academic careers with other options.&lt;ref name="JaschikOct2007"/&gt;

One outcome of these controversies was the founding of the Heterodox Academy in 2015, a [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] organization of professors seeking to increase the acceptance of diverse political viewpoints in academic discourse.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lerner|first1=Maura|title=Nurturing a new diversity on campus: 'Diversity of thought'|url=http://www.startribune.com/nurturing-a-new-diversity-on-u-campus-diversity-of-thought-to-bridge-political-differences/480416263/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2018, over 1500 college professors had joined Heterodox Academy.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedersdorf|first1=Conor|title=A New Leader in the Push for Diversity of Thought on Campus|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/02/a-new-leader-in-the-push-for-diversity-of-thought-on-campus/552275/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group publishes a ranking which rates the top 150 universities in the United States based on their commitment to diversity of viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Ronald|department=Hit &amp; Run Blog|title=How Heterodox Is Your University?|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/10/24/how-heterodox-is-your-university|website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|accessdate=24 May 2018|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Bradford|title=Harvard among least intellectually diverse universities: Report|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/24/harvard-among-least-intellectually-diverse-schools/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INSIGHT"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Healey |first1=Lauren |title=Report Ranks Universities Based on Acceptance of Viewpoint Diversity |url=http://www.insightintodiversity.com/report-ranks-universities-based-on-acceptance-of-viewpoint-diversity |website=INSIGHT Into Diversity |publisher=Potomac Publishing |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Shields and Joshua Dunn surveyed 153 conservative professors for their 2016 study ''[[Passing on the Right|Passing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University]]''.&lt;ref name="OSO"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jon A. Shields|author2=Joshua M.

One tactic used by about one-third of the professors was to "[[passing (sociology)|pass]]" (or pretend) to hold liberal views around their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt; Shields stated his view that the populist right may overstate the bias that does exist and that conservatives can succeed using mechanisms like academic tenure to protect their freedom.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=Do American Universities Discriminate Against Conservatives?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/conservatives-discrimination-universities/480372/|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proto-Italic language''' is the ancestor of the [[Italic languages]], including notably [[Latin]] and thus its descendants, the [[Romance languages]]. It is not directly attested in writing, but has been [[reconstructed language|reconstructed]] to some degree through the [[comparative method]]. Proto-Italic descended from the earlier [[Proto-Indo-European language]].

* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} was an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before a velar consonant.
* The voiced fricatives {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, {{IPA|[ɣʷ]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} were in [[complementary distribution]] with word-initial voiceless fricatives {{IPA|[ɸ]}}, {{IPA|[θ]}}, {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[xʷ]}} and {{IPA|[s]}}, and were thus originally simply [[allophones]] of each other. However, at some point in the Proto-Italic period, the allophony was somewhat disrupted by the loss of the voiceless allophones {{IPA|[xʷ]}} and {{IPA|[θ]}}, which merged with {{IPA|[ɸ]}}. Scholars disagree on whether to reconstruct Proto-Italic with the phonemes {{IPA|/xʷ ~ ɣʷ/}} and {{IPA|/θ ~ ð/}} still present (hence assuming that the merger with {{IPA|[ɸ]}} was a later areal change that spread across all extant dialects, possibly occurring simultaneous with or after the loss of the corresponding voiced fricatives), or to reconstruct Proto-Italic with the phonemes' voiceless allophones merged into {{IPA|/ɸ ~ β/}}, and their voiced allophones becoming independent phonemes {{IPA|/ð/}}, {{IPA|/ɣʷ/}}. Both of these sounds are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically, and eventually they were eliminated in all later languages, but differently in each.

* {{IPA|/ə/}} was perhaps not a true phoneme, but was inserted before consonants as a prop vowel. It can be reconstructed based on the outcome of the Proto-Indo-European syllabic nasals {{PIE|*m̥}} and {{PIE|*n̥}}, which appear in Latin as *em, *en or *im, *in, but also as *am, *an in Osco-Umbrian alongside *em, *en. Thus, it appears necessary to reconstruct {{IPA|/ə/}} as a distinct sound.

Proto-Italic had the following diphthongs:
* Short: {{lang|itc-x-proto|*ai}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*ei}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*oi}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*au}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*ou}}
* Long: {{lang|itc-x-proto|*āi}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*ēi}}, {{lang|itc-x-proto|*ōi}}

[[Osthoff's law]] remained productive in Proto-Italic. This caused long vowels to shorten when they were followed by a [[sonorant]] and another consonant in the same syllable: VːRC &gt; VRC. As the long diphthongs were also VːR sequences, they could only occur word-finally, and were shortened elsewhere. Long vowels were also shortened before word-final  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-m}}. This is the cause of the many occurrences of short  {{lang|itc-x-proto|-a-}} in, for example, the endings of the ā-stems or of ā-verbs.

===Prosody===
Proto-Italic words had a fixed stress on the first syllable. This stress pattern probably remained in most descendants. In Latin, it remained during the Old Latin period, after which it was replaced with the "Classical" penultimate stress pattern.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Nouns could have one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. They declined for seven of the eight Proto-Indo-European cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. The instrumental case had been lost. Nouns also declined for number in singular and plural. The dual number was no longer distinguished, although a few remnants (like Latin  {{lang|la|duo}},  {{lang|la|ambō}}) still preserved some form of the inherited dual inflection.

====o-stems====
This is the "second declension" of Latin. It descends from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. Most nouns in this class were masculine or neuter, but there may have been some feminine nouns as well.

* The genitive singular in  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-ī}} is of unknown origin, but is found in both Italic and Celtic. It mostly ousted the older (presumably inherited) genitive in  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-osjo}} in Latin. The older form is found in a few inscriptions, such as  {{lang|la|popliosio valesiosio}} on the [[Lapis Satricanus]]. It is also continued in some pronominal genitives, such as  {{lang|la|cuius}} &lt;  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*kʷojjo-s}} &lt;  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*kʷosjo}}, with  {{lang|itc-x-proto|-s}} added by analogy with the consonant stem genitive in  {{lang|itc-x-proto|-os}}.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=387}} In Osco-Umbrian, neither ending survives, being replaced with  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-eis}}, the i-stem ending.
* The nominative plural was originally  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-ōs}} for nouns and adjectives, and  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-oi}} for pronominal forms. The distribution in Proto-Italic is unclear, but both endings certainly still existed. The  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-ōs}} ending was replaced altogether in Latin in favour of  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-oi}}, whence the classical  {{lang|la|-ī}}. In Osco-Umbrian, the reverse happened, where  {{lang|la|*-oi}} was replaced with  {{lang|la|*-ōs}}, whence Oscan  {{lang|osc|-ús}}, Umbrian  {{lang|xum|-us}}.
* In Old Latin, the genitive plural was still generally  {{lang|la|-om}}, later  {{lang|la|-um}}. It was then reformed based on the ā-stem form  {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-āzom}}, giving the classical  {{lang|la|-ōrum}}.

====ā-stems====
This class represents the "first declension" of Latin. It derives primarily from Proto-Indo-European nouns in  {{PIE|*-eh₂-}}, and contained mostly feminine nouns, but maybe a few masculines.

* The accusative singular ending would have been ''*-am'' originally, due to shortening of long vowels before final ''*-m''. However, a long vowel is found in the attested forms. This long vowel most likely arose by analogy with the other endings that have a long vowel.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=268}}
* The genitive plural ending was originally a pronominal form, PIE ''*-eh₂-soHom''.

====Consonant stems====
This class contained nouns with stems ending in a variety of consonants. They included root nouns, n-stems, r-stems, s-stems and t-stems among others. They are grouped in Latin under the "third declension", which also includes the i-stems, originally a distinct class.

Masculine and feminine nouns declined alike, while neuters had different forms in the nominative/accusative/vocative.

Nouns in this class often had a somewhat irregular nominative singular form. This created several subtypes, based on the final consonant of the stem.

* For most consonant stem nouns, the ending of the nominative/vocative singular was ''-s'' for masculine and feminine nouns. This ending would cause devoicing, delabialisation and/or hardening of the stem-final consonant, as seen in {{lang|itc-x-proto|*sniks}} above. Neuter nouns had no ending.
* '''n-stems''' generally had the ending ''*-ō'', with the infix ''*-on-'' (or maybe ''*-en-'') in the other cases. Neuters had ''*-ən'' in the nom/voc/acc singular, while the stem of the remaining forms is unclear.
* '''r-stems''' had ''*-ēr'', alternating with ''*-(e)r-''. The alternation in vowel length was lost in Latin, but is preserved in Oscan.
* '''s-stems''' had ''*-ōs'' (for masculines and feminines) or ''*-os'' (for neuters). This alternated with ''*-ez-'' (or maybe ''*-oz-'' in some masculine/feminine nouns) in the other forms.
* The '''r/n-stems''' were a small group of neuter nouns. These had ''*-or'' in the nominative/vocative/accusative singular, but ''*-(e)n-'' in the remaining forms.

Other notes:
* The genitive singular had two possible endings. Both are attested side by side in Old Latin, although the ending ''-es''/''-is'' may also be from the i-stems (see below). In Osco-Umbrian, only the i-stem ending ''-eis'' is found.
* The Latin masculine nominative plural ending ''-ēs'' (with a long vowel) was taken from the i-stems.
* The neuter nominative/vocative/accusative plural originally had short ''*-a'' as the ending, or lengthening of the vowel before the final consonant. Already in Italic, this was replaced with the o-stem ending ''*-ā''.
* The dative (and ablative/locative?) plural ending would have originally been added directly to the stem, with no intervening vowel. In Latin, there is an intervening ''-e-'' or ''-i-'', while in Osco-Umbrian the ending is replaced altogether. It's not clear what the Proto-Italic situation was.

====i-stems====
This class represents the nouns of the Latin "third declension" that had the genitive plural ending ''-ium'' (rather than ''-um''). In Latin, the consonant stems gradually merged with this class. This process continued into the historical era; e.g. in [[Caesar]]'s time (c. 50 BC) the i-stems still had a distinct accusative plural ending ''-īs'', but this was replaced with the consonant-stem ending ''-ēs'' by the time of [[Augustus]] (c. 1 AD). In Proto-Italic, as in the other Italic languages, i-stems were still very much a distinct type and showed no clear signs of merging.

Masculine and feminine nouns declined alike, while neuters had different forms in the nominative/accusative/vocative.

* There were apparently two different forms for the genitive singular. The form ''-eis'' is found in Osco-Umbrian. However, ''-es'' appears in early Latin, while there is no sign of ''*-eis''. This could reflect the consonant-stem ending, but it could also come from ''*-jes''.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|pp=316–317}} Compare also ''*-wos'' of the u-stems, which ''is'' attested in Old Latin, and may represent a parallel formation.
* The original form of the neuter nominative/vocative/accusative plural was ''*-ī''. Already in Italic, this was extended by adding the o-stem ending to it.

====u-stems====
The u-stems form what is the "fourth declension" in Latin. They were historically parallel to the i-stems, and still showed many similar forms, with ''j/i'' being replaced with ''w/u''. However, sound changes had made them somewhat different over time.

* The neuter nominative/vocative/accusative singular must have originally been short ''*-u'', but in Latin only long ''-ū'' is found. It is unclear what the origin of this could be. It may be a remnant of a dual ending, considering that neuter u-stems were rare, and the few that survived tended to occur in pairs.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=323}}
* Like the i-stems, the u-stems had two possible types of genitive singular ending, with an unclear distribution. ''*-ous'' is found in Oscan, and it is also the origin of the usual Latin ending ''-ūs''. However, the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' inscription attests ''senatvos'', and the ending ''-uis'' (from ''*-wes'') is also found in a few sources.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=324}}
* The masculine/feminine nominative/vocative plural is not securely reconstructable. Latin ''-ūs'' seems to reflect ''*-ous'', but from PIE ''*-ewes'' the form ''*-owes'' (Latin ''*-uis'') would be expected. The ending is not attested in Osco-Umbrian or Old Latin, which might have otherwise given conclusive evidence.{{sfn|Sihler|1995|pp=325–326}}
* The original form of the neuter nominative/vocative/accusative plural was ''*-ū''. Already in Italic, this was extended by adding the o-stem ending to it, like in the i-stems.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives inflected much the same as nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives did not have inherent genders. Instead, they inflected for all three genders, taking on the same gender-form as the noun they referred to.

Adjectives followed the same inflectional classes of nouns. The largest were the o/ā-stem adjectives (which inflected as o-stems in the masculine and neuter, and as ā-stems in the feminine), and the i-stems. Present active participles of verbs (in ''*-nts'') and the comparative forms of adjectives (in ''*-jōs'') inflected as consonant stems. There were also u-stem adjectives originally, but they had been converted to i-stems by adding i-stem endings onto the existing u-stem, thus giving the nominative singular ''*-wis''.

===Verbs===

'''Present Aspect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rix|first1=Helmut|title=Towards a reconstruction of Proto-Italic|url=http://www.pies.ucla.edu/WeCIEC/Rix_H_2002.pdf|website=Program in Indo-European Studies|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=24 June 2017|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

From Proto-Indo-European, the Proto-Italic present aspect changed in a couple of ways. Firstly, a new past indicative suffix of {{lang|itc-x-proto|*-β-}} was created. This likely occurred due to the elision of word-final {{PIE|*i}} within the Indo-European primary verb endings (E.g. PIE Present Indicative {{PIE|*h₁ésti}} &gt; PIt {{lang|itc-x-proto|*est}}, but also PIE Past Indicative {{PIE|*h₁ést}}). Secondly, the desiderative suffix of {{PIE|*-s-/-so-}} became the future suffix in Proto-Italic. The subjunctive of this desiderative-future, with a suffix of both -s- and a lengthening of the following vowel, was used to represent a ''potentialis'' and ''irrealis'' mood. Finally, while the subjunctive and the optative of PIE were still in principle different moods, the moods became merged in Post-PIt developments (E.g. PIt subjunctive {{lang|itc-x-proto|*esed}} vs optative {{lang|itc-x-proto|*siēd}} which became Latin present subjunctive {{lang|la|sit}}).

The PIE dual person was also lost within PIt verbs just as it was in PIt nouns.

'''First Conjugation'''

This Conjugation pattern was derived from the PIE suffix {{PIE|*-eh₂-yé-ti}}, and formed primarily denominative verbs (I.e. deriving from a noun or an adjective).

Example Conjugation: '''*donā-''' (to give)&lt;ref name="Brill Academic Publishers"/&gt;

'''Third Conjugation'''

The bulk of Proto-Italic verbs were third-conjugation verbs, which were derived from Proto-Indo-European root thematic verbs. However, some are derived from other PIE verb classes, such as *linkʷō (PIE nasal-infix verbs) and *dikskō (PIE *sḱe-suffix verbs).

Example Conjugation: '''*ed-e/o-''' (to eat)&lt;ref name="Brill Academic Publishers"/&gt;

In addition to these conjugation, Proto-Italic also has some deponent verbs, such as *ōdai (Perfect-Present), as well as *gnāskōr (Passive-Active).

'''Perfective Aspect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rix|first1=Helmut|title=Towards a reconstruction of Proto-Italic|url=http://www.pies.ucla.edu/WeCIEC/Rix_H_2002.pdf|website=Program in Indo-European Studies|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=24 June 2017|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

According to Rix(2002), if a verb stem is present in both the Latino-Faliscan and Osco-Umbrian (''Sabellian'') branches, the present stem is identical in 90% of cases, but the perfect in only 50% of cases. This is likely because the original PIE aorist merged with the perfective aspect during the Proto-Italic period. Thus, the discrepancy in the similarities of present versus perfect stems in the two groupings of the Italic clade is likely attributed to different preservations in each group. The new common perfect stem in Latino-Faliscan derives mostly from the PIE Perfective, while the perfect stem in Osco-Umbrian derives mostly from the PIE aorist.

In the Proto-Italic period, the root perfect of PIE was lost with Ablaut being no longer productive. However, other PIE perfect and aorist stems were preserved, such as the reduplicated perfect and lengthened-vowel perfect stems, as well as the sigmatic aorist stem (found in Latin ''dīcō, dīxī'').

Sometimes, multiple perfect forms for each stem. For example, De Vaan gives the forms ''*fēk-, *fak-'' for the perfect stem of ''*fakiō'', and the reduplicated form &lt;FHEFHAKED&gt; is also attested on the [[Praeneste fibula]] in Old Latin.

In addition, there were some new innovations within the perfective aspect, with the -v- perfect (in Latin ''amō, amāvī'') and the -u- perfect (''moneō, monuī'') being later innovations, for example.

Example Long-Vowel Conjugation: '''*fēk-''' (to have done).&lt;ref&gt;(De Vaan 2008 p.198)&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively '''*θēk-''' (from PIE ''*dʰeh₁-'') if PIt is reconstructed at a stage before /xʷ/ and /θ/ had merged with /f/ [ɸ].

==Development==
A list of regular [[phonetic change]]s from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Italic follows. Because Latin is the only well-attested Italic language, it forms the main source for the reconstruction of Proto-Italic. It is therefore not always clear whether certain changes apply to all of Italic (a pre-PI change), or only to Latin (a post-PI change), because of lack of conclusive evidence.

===Obstruents===
* [[Velar consonant|Palatovelars]] merged with plain [[velar]]s, a change termed [[Centum-Satem isogloss|centumization]].
** *ḱ &gt; *k
** *ǵ &gt; *g
** *ǵʰ &gt; *gʰ
** Sequences of palatovelars and *w merged with [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]]: *ḱw, *ǵw, *ǵʰw &gt; *kʷ, *gʷ, *gʷʰ
* *p...kʷ &gt; *kʷ...kʷ, a change also found in Celtic.
* Labiovelars lose their labialisation before a consonant: *kʷC, *gʷC, *gʷʰC &gt; *kC, *gC, *gʰC.
* Obstruent consonants become (unaspirated) voiceless before another voiceless consonant (usually *s or *t).
* Voiced [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]]s become [[fricatives]]. Word-initially, they become voiceless, while they are allophonically voiced word-medially. Judging from Oscan evidence, they apparently remained fricatives even after a nasal consonant. In most other Italic languages they developed into stops later in that position.
** *bʰ &gt; *f {{IPA|[ɸ]}} (medially *β)
** *dʰ &gt; *θ (medially *ð)
** *gʰ &gt; *x (medially *ɣ)
** *gʷʰ &gt; *xʷ (medially *ɣʷ)
* *s was also allophonically voiced to *z word-medially.&lt;ref name=sylvestri326/&gt;
* *sr, *zr &gt; *θr, *ðr.{{clarify|reason=Are there any certain non-Latin examples of this?|date=April 2016}}
* *θ, *xʷ &gt; *f. Found in Venetic ''vhagsto''/''hvagsto'' (compare Latin ''faciō''). The voiced allophones *ð and *ɣʷ remained distinct from *β in Latin and Venetic, but also merged in Osco-Umbrian.
* *tl &gt; *kl word-medially.&lt;ref name=sylvestri326&gt;{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels and sonorants===
* *l̥, *r̥ &gt; *ol, *or&lt;ref name=sylvestri325/&gt;
* *m̥, *n̥ &gt; *əm, *ən (see above on "Vowels")
* *j is lost between vowels. The resulting vowels in hiatus contract into a long vowel if the two vowels are the same.
* *ew &gt; *ow.&lt;ref name=sylvestri325&gt;{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* *o &gt; *a before labials and *l.

===Laryngeals===
The [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] are a class of hypothetical PIE sounds *''h₁'', *''h₂'', *''h₃'' that usually disappeared in late PIE, leaving coloring effects on adjacent vowels. Their disappearance left some distinctive sound combinations in Proto-Italic. In the changes below, the # follows standard practice in denoting a word boundary; that is, # at the beginning denotes word-initial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakkum|2009|pp=58–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; H denotes any of the three laryngeals.

The simpler Italic developments of laryngeals are shared by many other Indo-European branches:
* *h₁e &gt; *e, *h₂e &gt; *a, *h₃e &gt; *o
* *eh₁ &gt; *ē, *eh₂ &gt; *ā, *eh₃ &gt; *ō
* *H &gt; *a between obstruents
* Laryngeals are lost word-initially before a consonant.

More characteristic of Italic are the interactions of laryngeals with [[sonorant consonant]]s. Here, R represents a sonorant, and C a consonant.
* #HRC &gt; #aRC and CHRC &gt; CaRC, but #HRV &gt; #RV
* CRHC &gt; CRāC, but CRHV &gt; CaRV
* CiHC and probably CHiC &gt; CīC

===Morphology===
* General loss of the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], with only a few relics remaining.&lt;ref name=sylvestri332&gt;{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss of the instrumental case.&lt;ref name=sylvestri332/&gt;

==Post-Italic developments==
Further changes occurred during the evolution of individual Italic languages. This section gives an overview of the most notable changes. For complete lists, see [[History of Latin]] and other articles relating to the individual languages.

* *x [[debuccalization|debuccalises]] to {{IPA|[h]}}. *ɣ similarly becomes {{IPA|[ɦ]}} between vowels, but remains elsewhere. This change possibly took place within the Proto-Italic period.  The result, whether {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, was written ''h'' in all Italic languages.
* *θ(e)r, *ð(e)r &gt; *f(e)r, *β(e)r in all but Venetic. Compare Venetic ''louder-obos'' to Latin ''līber'', Faliscan ''loifir-ta'', Oscan ''lúvfreis''.
* *β, *ð, *ɣ &gt; Latin b, d, g. In Osco-Umbrian the result is f (probably voiced) for all three. In Faliscan, *β remains a [[fricative]].
* *ɣʷ &gt; gʷ in Latin, which then develops as below. &gt; f in Osco-Umbrian.
* *dʷ &gt; b in classical Latin, although still retained in the archaic (see [[Duenos inscription]])
* *kʷ, *gʷ &gt; p, b in Osco-Umbrian. They are retained in Latino-Faliscan and Venetic. In Latin, *gʷ &gt; v {{IPA|[w]}} except after *n.
* *z &gt; r in Classical Latin and Umbrian, but not in Old Latin or Oscan.
* Final -ā (fem. sg. nom., neut. pl. nom./acc.) &gt; {{IPA|[oː]}} in Osco-Umbrian,&lt;ref&gt;Written ''o'' in the Latin alphabet, but '''ú''' in the native Oscan alphabet, and '''u''' or sometimes '''a''' in the native Umbrian alphabet. See {{Harvcolnb|Sihler|1995|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=266}} but becomes short ''-a'' in Latin.
* Final *-ns (acc. pl. of various noun classes), *-nts (masc. nom. sg. of participles), and *-nt (neut. nom./acc. sg. of participles) developed in complex ways:{{sfn|Sihler|1995|p=230}}

* [[History of Latin#Vowels|Latin vowel reduction]], during the Old Latin period. This merged many of the unstressed short vowels; most dramatically, all short vowels merged (usually to /i/) in [[open syllable|open]] medial syllables. Furthermore, all diphthongs became pure vowels except for *ai and *au (and occasionally *oi) in initial syllables.

{{for|the sociolinguistic term|Register (sociolinguistics)}}

In [[phonology]], a '''register''', or '''pitch register''', is a [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature of syllables in certain languages in which [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], vowel [[phonation]], [[glottalization]] or similar features depend upon one another.

It occurs in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Wu Chinese]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

==Burmese==
In Burmese, differences in tone correlate with vowel phonation and so neither exists independently. There are three registers in Burmese, which have traditionally been considered three of the four "tones". (The fourth is not actually but a closed syllable, called "[[entering tone]]" in translations of Chinese phonetics.) Jones (1986) views the differences as "resulting from the intersection of both pitch registers and voice registers.... Clearly Burmese is not tonal in the same sense as such other languages and therefore requires a different concept, namely that of pitch register."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jones, 1986. ''Pitch register languages,'' pp 135-136, in John McCoy &amp; Timothy Light eds., ''Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnamese==
Similarly, several Vietnamese "tones" are largely distinguished by characteristics other than pitch. For example, in Northern Vietnamese, a ''ngã'' syllable is distinguished from the ''sắc'' primarily by the presence of a glottalization in the vowel. The ''nặng'' and ''huyền'' syllables are distinguished primarily by having a short [[creaky voice|creaky]] vowel, as opposed to a long [[breathy voice|breathy]] vowel.

==Khmer==
[[Khmer language|Khmer]] is sometimes considered to be a register language. It has also been called a "restructured register language" because both its pitch and phonation can be considered allophonic. If they are ignored, the phonemic distinctions that they carry remain as differences in [[diphthong]]s and [[vowel length]].

==Latvian==
An example of a non-Asian language with register distinctions is [[Latvian language|Latvian]], at least in the central dialects underlying the standard form.  Long vowels in stressed syllables are often said to take one of three [[pitch accent]]s that are conventionally called  "rising", falling", and "broken". However, the "broken tone" is distinguished not by pitch but by glottalization, much like the ''ngã'' register of Northern Vietnamese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7182">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 20''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of the sections of the [[Constitution of Canada]] dealing with [[Canada]]'s two [[official language]]s, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].  Along with [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]], section 20 is one of the few sections under the title "Official Languages of Canada" that guarantees bilingualism outside [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]], legislatures and [[Court system of Canada|courts]].  This also makes it more extensive than language rights in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Constitutional Law of Canada.''  2003 Student Ed.  Scarborough, Ontario:  Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 1151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 20's specific function is to establish a right to English and French services from the governments of Canada and [[New Brunswick]].

==Text==
Section 20 reads:

{{cquote|20.(1)  Any member of the public in Canada has the right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any head or central office of an institution of the Parliament or government of Canada in English or French, and has the same right with respect to any other office of any such institution where

:(a)  there is a significant demand for communications with and services from that office in such language; or

:(b)  due to the nature of the office, it is reasonable that communications with and services from that office be available in both English and French.

(2)  Any member of the public in New Brunswick has the right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any office of an institution of the legislature or government of New Brunswick in English or French.}}

==Rights and limitations==
Section 20 applies to services from offices of Parliament and the government of Canada, including government departments and the [[bureaucracy]].  According to some judicial decisions, it also applies to services from [[police]] departments and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], although not all police officers need to be bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bastarache (1992), 128 N.B.R. (2d) 217 (N.B.Q.B.)., Gautreau v. R., (1989), 101 N.B.R. (2d) 1 (N.B.Q.B.), Gingras v. Canada, [1990] 2 F.C. 68 (F.C.T.D.).  The fact that not all police officers need to be bilingual was established in R. v. Haché, (1992), 127 N.B.R. (2d) 177 (N.B.Q.B.).&lt;/ref&gt;  The section's requirements are fully applicable to the ''main'' of these offices on the federal level.  Section 20 limits its rights only when dealing with the lower-level offices, where there must be considerable interest for services in both languages, or if the offices are filling a function that one would expect should be carried out in both languages.&lt;ref name="Hogg1153"&gt;Hogg, page 1153.&lt;/ref&gt;

As section 20 applies to offices besides Parliament and the courts, it is more extensive than [[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 17]]-[[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|22]] of the ''Charter'' and language rights in section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  As far as the text is concerned, these rights are even more extensive in respect to the government of New Brunswick, where there are no requirements for considerable interest for the right to exist.&lt;ref name="Hogg1153"/&gt;

As constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] notes, other provinces are not required to provide bilingual services under section 20, but some choose to do so under provincial legislation.&lt;ref name="Hogg1153"/&gt;

==Judicial interpretation==
In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'' (1986), Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] remarked that the limited rights in section 20 seemed to contrast with section 16, which encourages growth in government bilingualism.  However, she speculated Parliament could use section 16 to heighten expectations for bilingualism in section 20, by giving the requirement for considerable interest in bilingualism a flexible interpretation.  Wilson did, however, write that courts could not employ this flexible interpretation.

The requirement for considerable interest was interpreted in ''Saulnier v. The Queen'', (1989),&lt;ref&gt;''Saulnier v. The Queen'', (1989), 90 N.S.R. (2d) 77 (N.S. Cty. Ct.),&lt;/ref&gt; in which it was found that the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries]] violated section 20 by providing English-only services, (1) by simply presuming there was no need for French services, (2) because there were penal consequences for anyone who disobeyed the law not provided in French, and (3) even though some French Canadians understood English, French was still their first language.  In ''Professional Institute of the Public Service v. The Queen'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;''Professional Institute of the Public Service v. The Queen'' (1993), 60 F.T.R. 194 (F.C.T.D.).,&lt;/ref&gt; it was added that relevant factors for requiring bilingualism should include the number of people in a [[minority language]] community, interest among the population, and relations between the people and the government.  Statistics and the practices of the office might be of use in measuring these things.

In ''R. v. Haché'', (1993),&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Haché'', (1993) 139 N.B.R. (2d) 81 (N.B.C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt; it was found the government is not under any obligation to tell people that they have rights under section 20.

==Public views==
In 1989, a few political scientists published a survey on the public's opinion on section 20.  It indicated that [[French Canadian]]s strongly support French services outside [[Quebec]] and in almost equal measure support the same rights for [[English-speaking Quebecer|English Quebec]].  Ninety-seven percent of English Canadians support the right for English Quebeckers, and 65% of English Canadians supported the rights of French Canadians under section 20.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Sniderman, Joseph F. Fletcher, Peter H. Russell and Philip E. Tetlock, "Political Culture and the Problem of Double Standards: Mass and Elite Attitudes toward Language Rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms," ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'', vol. 22, no. 2. (June 1989), pp. 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Speech Synthesis Markup Language''' ('''SSML''') is an [[XML]]-based [[markup language]] for [[speech synthesis]] applications. It is a recommendation of the [[W3C]]'s [[voice browser]] working group. SSML is often embedded in [[VoiceXML]] scripts to drive interactive telephony systems. However, it also may be used alone, such as for creating audio books. For desktop applications, other markup languages are popular, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] embedded speech commands, and [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Speech Application Programming Interface|SAPI]] [[Text to speech]] (TTS) markup, also an XML language.

SSML is based on the [[Java Speech Markup Language]] (JSML) developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], although the current recommendation was developed mostly by speech synthesis vendors. It covers virtually all aspects of synthesis, although some areas have been left unspecified, so each vendor accepts a different variant of the language. Also, in the absence of markup, the synthesizer is expected to do its own interpretation of the text. So SSML is not a strict standard in the sense of [[C (programming language)|C]], or even [[HTML]].

==Example==
Here is an example of an SSML document:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;!-- ?xml version="1.0"? --&gt;
&lt;speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis"
       xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
       version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;metadata&gt;
    &lt;dc:title xml:lang="en"&gt;Telephone Menu: Level 1&lt;/dc:title&gt;
  &lt;/metadata&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;s xml:lang="en-US"&gt;
      &lt;voice name="David" gender="male" age="25"&gt;
        For English, press &lt;emphasis&gt;one&lt;/emphasis&gt;.
      &lt;/voice&gt;
    &lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;s xml:lang="es-MX"&gt;
      &lt;voice name="Miguel" gender="male" age="25"&gt;
        Para español, oprima el &lt;emphasis&gt;dos&lt;/emphasis&gt;.
      &lt;/voice&gt;
    &lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/speak&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Features==
SSML specifies a fair amount of markup for [[prosody (linguistics) |prosody]], which is not apparent in the above example. This includes markup for 
* pitch
* contour
* pitch range
* rate
* duration
* volume

'''Vocabulary learning''' is the process acquiring building blocks in [[second language acquisition]] Restrepo Ramos (2015). The impact of vocabulary on proficiency in second language performance "has become […] an object of considerable interest among researchers, teachers, and materials developers"Huckin &amp; Coady, 1999, p. 182). From being a "neglected aspect of language learning" (Meara, 1980, as cited in Xu &amp; Hsu, 2017) vocabulary gained recognition in the literature and reclaimed its position in teaching. Educators shifted their attention from accuracy to fluency by moving from the Grammar translation method to communicative approaches to teaching. As a result, incidental vocabulary teaching and learning became one of the two major types of teaching programs along with the deliberate approach. 

==Types and strategies of vocabulary learning==
There are two major types of [[vocabulary]] learning: deliberate and incidental. vocabulary learning types and low-frequency are important components in a vocabulary teaching program. The two major types of vocabulary learning are deliberate and low-frequency. It is important to treat these types as complementary -rather than mutually exclusive- by using different vocabulary learning strategies and their combinations.

[[Scott Thornbury]] (2002) describes these types by stating that "some of the words will be learned actively", while others "will be picked up incidentally" (p. 32). [http://newsroom.aua.am/2016/09/01/new-faculty-member-joins-ma-tefl-program/ Dodigovic] (2013) and [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2006) emphasize the same distinction - only using a different term for the one side of this dichotomy: deliberate vocabulary learning. [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2006) also adds another nuance to this concept by calling it "deliberate, decontextualized vocabulary learning" (p. 495). Elgort (2011) to uses the term ''deliberate'', while DeCarrico (2001) prefers to talk about "explicit versus implicit learning" (p. 10). Other authors, although employing various terminology are also in favor of this same distinction. For example, throughout their article, Alemi and Tayebi (2011) talk of “incidental and intentional” vocabulary learning, as does also Hulstijn (2001). Expanding the terminology even further, Gu (2003) uses the terms “explicit and implicit learning mechanisms” throughout his article in discussing the second language learning strategies.  Whatever terminology is used in the literature by different authors, the two major types of vocabulary learning are discussed: explicit and incidental. These two concepts should not be perceived as competitors but rather as ''mutually reinforcing'' ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2006b).

In both types of vocabulary learning or their combination, the efficiency of learning is achieved by following one or more of the vocabulary learning strategies. Different researchers look into the nature of this concept from various perspectives. Given that vocabulary learning strategies are very diverse, [[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]](2000) suggests a summary of major vocabulary learning strategies and classify them into five groups: determination, social, memory, cognitive and meta-cognitive. Building on this classification, Xu and Hsu (2017) suggest two major categories of vocabulary learning strategies – direct and indirect. The first category includes four types of strategies: memory, cognitive and compensation strategies; the second category contains the meta-cognitive, effective and social strategies. Based on their research, Lawson and Hogben (1996) distinguish repetition as the major strategy of vocabulary learning, while Mokhtar et al. (2009) explain that ESL students prefer vocabulary strategies such as guessing and using a dictionary. 

===Deliberate Vocabulary Learning===
One of the major types of vocabulary learning in language acquisition is deliberate vocabulary learning. Before moving on to presenting the literature, it is important to mention that when talking about deliberate vocabulary learning, various terminologies are used by different linguists and writers. Elgort and Warren (2014), as well as [[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]] (2000), use the term explicit (which is mostly used for grammar teaching), while [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2006) uses the word decontextualized vocabulary learning and contrasts the term with "learning from context" (p. 494) without explicitly using the term incidental vocabulary learning. Intentional vocabulary learning ([http://newsroom.aua.am/2016/09/01/new-faculty-member-joins-ma-tefl-program/ Dodigovic], Jeaco &amp; Wei, 2017; Hulstijn, 2001), active learning ([[Scott Thornbury|Thornbury]], 2002), and direct instruction (Lawrence et al., 2010) are also used. However, throughout this paper, the term deliberate (Elgort, 2011; [[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2006) will be used to refer to this concept.
 
The advocates of deliberate vocabulary learning paradigm -for example, Coady, 1993; [[Paul Nation|Nation]], 1990, 2001, as cited in Ma &amp; Kelly, 2006- agree that context is the main source for vocabulary acquisition. However, they also believe that in order to be able to build up sufficient vocabulary and acquire the necessary strategies to handle the context when reading, learners need support. Thus, extensive reading may be sufficient for developing advanced students’ vocabulary, but it has to be supplemented with deliberate vocabulary learning at lower proficiency levels (Elgort &amp; Warren, 2014). Kennedy (2003) supports this notion and argues that deliberate learning is more appropriate for students with up to an intermediate level of proficiency, while incidental learning, which can occur outside the classroom, is more valuable with higher proficiency students. The limited classroom time should be spent on the deliberate teaching of vocabulary ([[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]], 2000), as the main problem of vocabulary teaching is that only a few words, or a small part of what is required to know a word, can be taught at a time (Ma &amp; Kelly, 2006). Ma and Kelly (2006) argue that learning a word requires more “deliberate mental effort” than merely being engaged in meaning-focused activities. However, according to the authors, the advocates of deliberate approach believe that it should be combined with incidental learning to be more efficient. 

[[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]] (2000) demonstrates that deliberate vocabulary learning, unlike incidental learning, is ''time-consuming'', and ''too laborious''. Moreover, according to [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2005), deliberate vocabulary learning is “one of the least efficient ways” to improve students’ vocabulary knowledge. Yet, he claims that it is a vital component in vocabulary teaching programs. However, [[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]] (2000) states that deliberate vocabulary learning gives the learners the “greatest chance” for acquiring vocabulary, as it focuses their attention directly on the target vocabulary. He presents an important concept from the field of psychology: “the more one manipulates, thinks about, and uses mental information, the more likely it is that one will retain that information” (p. 121). The deeper the processing, the more likely it is for the newly learned words to be remembered. Therefore, explicit attention should also be given to vocabulary, especially when the aim is language-focused learning ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2006b). According to Ellis (1994, as cited in Laufer &amp; Hulstijn, 2001), while the meaning of a word requires “conscious processing” and is learned deliberately, the articulation of its form is learned incidentally because of frequent exposure. Ma and Kelly (2006) mention the necessity of establishing a link between the meaning and form of a word by various strategies, e.g., “direct memorization,” which is a strategy of deliberate vocabulary teaching.

In vocabulary teaching programs, it is also necessary to consider the frequency of the words ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2006b). Thus, high-frequency words deserve to be taught explicitly (Kennedy, 2003) and sometimes even low-frequency words can be taught and learned deliberately, for example through word cards, word part analysis, and dictionary as recommended by [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2006b). However, when measuring the difficulty by the results, deliberate vocabulary learning is easier than incidental learning, yet it needs more focused effort. Therefore, directing deliberate attention to the particular aspect can lighten [https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/2006-Vocabulary-second-language.pdf "the learning burden"] ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2006a).

To sum up, deliberate vocabulary learning is essential to reach a ''threshold'' of the vocabulary size and it is a ''prerequisite'' to incidental learning ([[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]], 2000).

===Incidental Vocabulary Learning===
Another type of vocabulary learning is called incidental vocabulary learning. By its nature, incidental vocabulary learning is one of the key aspects of language acquisition. This concept, which is also referred to as passive learning (Shmidth, 1990; as cited in Alemi &amp; Tayebi, 2011) or implicit learning (Gu, 2003), is the process of acquiring vocabulary without placing the focus on specific words to be learned (Paribakht &amp; Wesche, 1999). It is deemed that, this type of learning should occur with low-frequency words ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 2005) as the first few thousand words are better learned through deliberate learning approach (Huckin &amp; Coady 1999). However, this may be hampered by the fact that several encounters with a word are needed before it is committed to memory ([[Paul Nation|Nation]], 1990), which may not be possible with low-frequency words ([[Paul Nation|Nation]] 1990).
Aelmi and Tayebi (2011) as well as [[Norbert Schmitt|Schmitt]] (2000) link incidental vocabulary learning with the communicative context. The formers stress that incidental vocabulary learning occurs by "picking up structures and lexicon of a language, through getting engaged in a variety of communicative activities" (p. 82), while the latter indicates that producing language for ''communicational purposes'' results in incidental learning.

There is a number of factors which affect the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning. Most of the scholars agree that the best way is through extensive reading (Jian-ping, 2013; Restrepo Ramos, 2015). Restrepo Ramos (2015) indicates that “there is strong evidence that supports the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning through reading for meaning comprehension” (p. 164).  However, as research shows, 95% of the words must be familiar to the reader to understand a text (Hirsh &amp; [[Paul Nation|Nation]], 1992; Laufer, 1989). According to [[Paul Nation|Nation]] (2009), this figure is even higher, i.e., 98 percent. Huckin &amp; Coady (1999), on the other hand, argue that "extensive reading for meaning does not automatically lead to the acquisition of vocabulary. Much depends on the context surrounding each word, and the nature of the learner's attention" (p. 183). While [http://newsroom.aua.am/2016/09/01/new-faculty-member-joins-ma-tefl-program/ Dodigovic] (2015) finds that it is the approach that matters, i.e., the bottom-up processing of readings is better than the top-down. Thus, to develop incidental vocabulary learning, the learners should be exposed to the words in different informative contexts, following the bottom-up processing of the readings.

'''''Vogelfrei''''' in [[German language|German]] usage denotes the status of a person on whom a legal penalty of [[outlawry]] has been imposed. However, the original meaning of the term referred to independence, being "free as a bird"; the current negative meaning developed only in the 16th century. It then came to predominate through the influence of [[Baroque]] poetry and of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (German Grammar; 1819).

==History and etymology==
Originally, the word ''vogelfrei'' merely meant "as free as a bird, not bound." That is the usage in older sources.&lt;ref&gt;According to a 1455 document, clerics of Buchenau monastery were "vogelfrei" (i.e. liberal, generous) if they donated one penny a year. Schmidt-Wiegand, p. 931, including further examples.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Luther and Zwingli used the word still in its original meaning.

Much later the term was linked to a person being banned. This resulted from the formulas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As you have been lawfully judged and banished for murder, so I remove your body and good from the state of peace and rule them strifed and proclaim you free of any redemption and rights ''and I proclaim you as free as the birds in the air'' and the beasts in the forest and the fish in the water, and you shall not have peace nor company on any road or by any ruling of the emperor or king.&lt;ref&gt;Article 241 of the ''Bamberger Halsgerichtsordnung'' [Bamberg Penal Code], quoted by Jacob Grimm, volume I, p. 58: ("als du mit urteil u. recht zu der mordacht erteilt worden bist, also nim ich dein leib u. gut aus dem fride und thu sie in den unfrid und künde dich erlös u. rechtlos und künde dich den vögeln frei in den lüften und den tieren in dem wald und den vischen in dem waßer und solt auf keiner straßen noch in keiner mundtat, die keiser oder künig gefreiet haben, nindert fride noch geleit haben; …")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;his body should be free and accessible to all people and beasts, to the birds in the air&lt;ref&gt;Grimm noted here in a footnote: hence outlawed, ''permissus avibus''; the older language also had another meaning: free as a bird. Konrad von Würzburg: ''Trojanischer Krieg'' [Trojan War]. Verse 14,516, 'I'm free as the bird on a twig' [daher vogelfrei, permissus avibus; die ältere sprache sagte auch in anderm sinn: vrî als ein vogel] Konrad von Würzburg: . Vers 14516; ich bin frî als der vogel ûf dem zwî]. Laßberg (ed.) ''Liedersaal'' [Hall of Songs]. (1820 to 1825). Volume 3, p. 637"&lt;/ref&gt; and the fish in water so that none can be made liable for any crimes committed against him&lt;ref&gt;"sein leib soll frei und erlaubt sein allen leuten und thieren, den vögeln in den lüften, den vischen im waßer, so daß niemand gegen ihn einen frevel begehen kann, dessen er büßen dürfe". Wigand, Das Femgericht Westphalens. Hamm 1825, p. 436; cited by Grimm, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ban also implied that persons sentenced thus were not to be granted any dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;"Aqua et ignis interdictus" ({{lang-la|Deprived of water and hearth fire}})&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of death one's body was not buried, but left for the birds to feed on.&lt;ref&gt;"permissus avibus" (Latin: free for the birds)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to modern research the cause for the spreading of the pejorative meaning is not to be sought there but rather in the language of the mercenaries and soldiers of that time. This theory is supported by the loan word "Preis" [price] in German ({{lang-it|presa}}, {{lang-fr|prize}}), which in this context is synonymous with the word "booty". Malicious people would be "''preis gegeben und vogelfrey" [lit: given away and free as the birds].&lt;ref&gt;Still noted thus as a pair of terms in ''Constitutio criminalis Theresiana'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Maria Theresa]]'s Criminal Law], 31 December 1768&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Das Kapital]]'' Volume I, [[Marx]] uses the term ''vogelfrei'' to refer to the emergence of the proletariat during the decay of [[feudalism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proletariat created by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible expropriation of the people from the soil, this free and rightless* [''vogelfrei''] proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by the nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world. On the other hand, these men, suddenly dragged from their accustomed mode of life, could not immediately adapt themselves to the discipline of their new condition. They were turned in massive quantities into beggars, robbers and vagabonds, partly from inclination, in most cases under the force of circumstances. Hence at the end of the fifteenth and during the whole of the sixteenth centuries, a bloody legislation against vagabondage was enforced throughout Western Europe. The fathers of the present working class were chastised for their enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers. Legislation treated them as ‘voluntary’ criminals, and assumed that it was entirely within their powers to go on working under the old conditions which in fact no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital'', Volume One, 1976, Fowkes trans, p. 896.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marx calls this second group free or “bird-free” (''vogelfrei''), meaning at one and the same time that while the proletariat are not property (as slaves), they are themselves without property and cast out of the community of property owners.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Read, ''Primitive Accumulation: The Aleatory Foundation of Capitalism'', ''Rethinking Marxism'' '''14'''(2), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
