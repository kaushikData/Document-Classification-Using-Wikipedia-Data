The '''2009 G20 London summit protests''' occurred in the days around the 2 April [[2009 G20 London summit]]. The summit was the focus of protests from a number of groups over various long-standing and topical issues. These ranged from disquiet over economic policy, anger at the banking system and bankers' remuneration and bonuses, the continued [[war on terror]] and concerns over [[climate change]].

Although the majority of the protests and protesters were peaceful, the threat of violence and criminal damage were used by police as a reason to detain, or "[[kettling|kettle]]", protesters as part of [[Operation Glencoe]]. A bystander, [[death of Ian Tomlinson|Ian Tomlinson]], died shortly after being pushed to the ground by a police officer. A second [[post-mortem]] revealed that Tomlinson may have died from an [[Bleeding|abdominal haemorrhage]]. The inquest into Tomlinson's death found that he was unlawfully killed.

A peace activist climbed over the railings into the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] as a symbolic gesture of "power to the people". When arrested by police he explained that "This is the people's parliament, and I am one of the people".

==Put People First==

On 28 March 2009, 35,000 people marched through London. At a rally in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], they were addressed by [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] co-chair [[Kumi Naidoo]], [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] General Secretary [[Brendan Barber]], environmentalist [[Tony Juniper]], activist comedian [[Mark Thomas]], and global justice author Susan George amongst others. They heard calls for international action to deliver tax justice, [[trade justice]] and a [[Green New Deal]] in both rich and poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.putpeoplefirst.org.uk/2009/03/35000-thanks-a-strong-signal-to-the-g20-from-the-london-put-people-first-march/.

The Put People First alliance of more than 160 unions, development, faith and environment groups called on the G20 leaders to recognise that "only just, fair and sustainable policies can lead the world out of recession, and that a return to 'business as usual' – with the associated poverty, inequality and climate change – is not an option".

Christian NGOs including World Vision and Tearfund organised an ecumenical service on the day at Methodist Central Hall, overseen by the Bishop of London. Delegations joined the march from around the world, including Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Korea, USA, Australia, South Africa, Zambia, Canada and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/economic-crisis-campaign.html|title=404 Not Found|publisher=|access-date=22 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416101446/http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/economic-crisis-campaign.html|archive-date=16 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Camp in the City" ({{coord|51.5152|-0.0825|type:landmark}}) on 1 April 2009 aimed to draw attention to [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]], claiming that far from being a way of reducing release of climate change gasses in the atmosphere it is used as an excuse to continue doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/carbon-trading |title=Carbon trading |publisher=Climate Camp |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjV5IF5W?url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/carbon-trading |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp took place outside the [[European Climate Exchange]] in [[Bishopsgate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/G20-Summit-Protests-Guide-To-Whats-Going-To-Happen-And-When/Article/200904115253140?videoSourceID=2fa12d8859160210VgnVCM1000005d04170aRCRD&amp;lpos=UK_News_Article_Inline_Player_List_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15253140_G20_Summit_Protests%3A_Guide_To_Whats_Going_To_Happen_And_When|title=Timetable of Disruption: The Summit Protests|work=Sky News|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the actual camp a group of participants had played a game called "capture the flag" in the area on 27 March which was used by the protesters to familiarise themselves with the locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/uk/7961868.stm|title=Eco-activists prepare for protest|work=BBC News | accessdate= 19 April 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Camp organisers agreed to meet with police and exchange contact details shortly before the protest. The meeting was arranged by [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[David Howarth]], who was to mediate at the meeting which was to take place at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

Before the event Commander Simon O'Brien said that the capital would see "almost unprecedented level of activity" of protest activity with seven officially notified demonstrations and possibly many more they don't know about. [[Scotland Yard]] described the G20 policing plan as one of the largest, most challenging and complicated public order operations it has ever devised. They said that the level and style of activity on the internet suggested a re-emergence of groups with similar aims to the anti-globalisation protesters who turned to violence in 2000 and 2001. They said they were determined to avoid the violent scenes of the 2001 [[27th G8 summit|G8 in Genoa]] in which one protester was killed and hundreds more injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7971212.stm|title=The challenge of policing the G20|work=BBC news | date=30 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days leading up to the summit, the [[Metropolitan police]] warned protest groups that the protests on 1 April would be "very violent" and that they were "up for it, and up to it" in the event of trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest|title=Fears police tactics at G20 protests will lead to violence|last=Lewis|first=Paul|author2=Sandra Laville, John Vidal|date=27 March 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-08 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330060646/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police used the crowd-control tactic known as containment or the “[[Kettling|kettle]]”, to hold 5,000 people inside a police cordon without food, drink or lavatory facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Similar tactics had been used in New York [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/02/politics/campaign/02protest.html?_r=1 Tactics by Police Mute the Protesters, and Their Messages] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; This combined with riot police pushing into crowds with shields and batons.

Ian Tomlinson died after being shoved and struck by a police officer within a police cordon of the G20 Meltdown protest near the Bank of England. Initially the City of London Police denied that any incident with the police had occurred, and the death was attributed to natural causes.

Including a number of raids on squats on 2 April 2009, the police made over 100 arrests and said they had identified and would track down those who had broken the law. A teenage girl was convicted of criminal damage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/03/g20-teenage-girl-jail | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Teenage girl faces jail over G20 violence | first=Anil | last=Dawar | date=3 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 5,000 people took part in the protests.&lt;ref name="deal1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7978105.stm |title=G20 leaders seal $1tn global deal |date=2 April 2009 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402012950/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7978105.stm| archivedate= 2 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the policing of the event will turn out to have been the most expensive police operation in British history at an estimated cost of up to £8 million, or £1,600 per protester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5023042/G20-to-be-most-expensive-police-operation-in-British-history.html|title=G20 to be most expensive police operation in British history|work=The Telegraph | location=London | first=Richard | last=Edwards | date=20 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One raid on a climate change group the day after the main protests was ruled to have been illegal in March 2010, the Met Commissioner said that it was unlawful to arrest and search protestors and to force them to be recorded on film. Two protesters were each awarded £3000 compensation after the Met admitted the operation was unlawful as there were no reasonable grounds for suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/met+police+to+pay+g20+protest+compensation/3587057 Met police to pay G20 protest compensation] Channel 4 News 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to police tactics===
The police choice of "Operation Glencoe" as a codename was linked with the [[Glencoe Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/28/g20-protests-london | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=G20 protests: Cry havoc – and let slip a rainbow alliance of summit protesters | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=28 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7973178.stm | work=BBC News | title=Live: G20 Summit Build-up | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the buildup to the protests the chairman of the [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]], [[Andrew Dismore|Andrew Dismore, MP]], said that "The police have a duty under the Human Rights Act to facilitate protest and not frustrate it. If they act in a confrontational way and use confrontation language, they will start to provoke the kind of behaviour they are seeking to prevent. There may well be a fringe element that want to incite violence. But that doesn't mean police should criminalise every protester." [[David Howarth]], a Liberal Democrat MP, said: "I am increasingly worried that what the police are saying about the protests will end up in a self-fulfilling prophecy. By talking up the prospect of violence they [the police] will put off peaceful demonstrators and start to attract other sorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fears police tactics at G20 protests will lead to violence | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=27 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jenny Jones (Green politician)|Jenny Jones]], a member of the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]], said of reports of [[police brutality]] that "If the police were hitting people who were sitting down with their hands up, we have entered a new era of overt violent policing in Britain that will deter people from protesting and cut back our civil liberties". A police Commander said that their "tactics were proportionate and worked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7981932.stm|title=Concern over G20 police tactics |date=3 April 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090406074158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7981932.stm| archivedate= 6 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Lambert|Jean Lambert, MEP]], of the London [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], wrote an open letter to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner after the event asking for an explanation of the police tactics at the climate camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/region/london/news/2009-04-03formal-letter-to-metropolitan-police-commissioner-sir-paul-stephenson.html |title=Formal letter to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjV5hbom?url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/region/london/news/2009-04-03formal-letter-to-metropolitan-police-commissioner-sir-paul-stephenson.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-06-12 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Union of Journalists]] has considered taking legal action after Section 14 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] was used against journalists covering the protests on 2 April. The City of London police asked them to leave the area at the Royal Exchange for half an hour, and threatened arrest if they refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/17/g20-police-photographers-nuj|title=G20: NUJ considers legal action over police treatment of photographers|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=17 April 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-24 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090420034123/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/17/g20-police-photographers-nuj| archivedate= 20 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 is to prevent "serious public disorder, serious criminal damage or serious disruption to the life of the community". The police earlier apologised to journalists reporting the 1 April protests at the Bank of England: "Section 14 was applied outside the Bank of England to disperse protesters. There may have been some photographers caught up in that. If so we apologise. We respect the right of photographers to cover current events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/08/g20-protest-police-apology-photographers|title=Police apologise for obstructing photographers at G20 protest|last=Sweney|first=Matt|date=8 April 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-24 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411024435/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/08/g20-protest-police-apology-photographers| archivedate= 11 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]], the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, expressed "concern that the video footage of some police actions are clearly disturbing and should be thoroughly investigated", and a need to be reassured that the use of the containment, or [[kettling]] tactic "remains appropriate and proportionate".&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/8000246.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police begin G20 tactics review | date=16 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] has said that some police behaviour "fell short of the police medal promise to "guard my people"."&lt;ref name=thirdpostmortem/&gt; Others have defended the policing of the protests.

The [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] has also criticised the IPCC, making a formal complaint about the "deplorable behaviour" of Nick Hardwick, Chairman of the IPCC, for passing "lofty and withering judgment on London's police officers".&lt;ref name=thirdpostmortem&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/22/ian-tomlinson-g20-protests Ian Tomlinson G20 death: coroner grants request for third postmortem] The Guardian, 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Home Office Minister [[Lord West]] said in the House of Lords that "thousands of officers acted absolutely professionally and proportionately, thousands were actually able to demonstrate peacefully on our streets, criminal activity in the rest of the metropolis was kept to an absolute minimum and the police also maintained high levels of security.

On 14 April, media outlets published video taken during a vigil for Ian Tomlinson on 2 April outside the [[Bank of England]], near to where he died. A sergeant with the [[Territorial Support Group]] is seen slapping a woman who was arguing with him, Nicola Fisher, across the face, then striking her legs with his baton. The officer's identification number was concealed.&lt;ref name=Woodwards&gt;Woodwards, Tristan.

Another demonstrator, Katie Surridge, has alleged that she was pushed to the ground from behind on 1 April by the same officer who later struck Nicola Fisher. That incident has also been reported to the IPCC.&lt;ref name=taser/&gt; IPCC have announced that there is no case to answer.

===Review of the policing of public events===

On 15 April 2009, [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Paul Stephenson]] asked the [[Chief Inspector of Constabulary]] to review policing tactics in the policing of public events. [[Denis O'Connor (Policeman)|Denis O'Connor]] will review the policing of public events following allegations of two assaults by police during the G20 protests in London on 1 April. He will also assess whether the tactic of containment or [[kettling]] is appropriate and proportionate to ensuring people have the right to protest. He said the event was a "complex policing operation", and that footage of clashes with police will be reviewed to check if other incidents need to be examined. Sir Paul stressed that all uniformed officers must wear shoulder identification numbers to be easily identifiable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8000246.stm|title=Police begin G20 tactics review |date=15 April 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416195221/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8000246.stm| archivedate= 16 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the tactics being reviewed is the crowd-control tactic known as the “[[Kettling|kettle]]”, used to pen in protesters.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk" /&gt; Bob Broadhurst, the commanding officer during the protests, blamed any misconduct of officers on the lack of training they receive in [[crowd control]] and on fear. He revealed during a Commons Home Affairs Committee that officers only receive 2 days of training a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8057685.stm | work=BBC News | title='Training concern' for G20 police | date=19 May 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 25 January 2011, Broadhurst apologised to the home affairs select committee for telling then in May 2009 that no plain-clothes officers were present at the demonstrations; He admitted that numerous City of London police officers had been present at the demonstration, along with more than one Met officer, including PC Mark Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/25/met-undercover-policing-unit-g20|title=Met counter-terrorism chief to take over protest spy unit|author=Rob Evans|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2011 the high court has ruled that the Metropolitan police broke the law in the way they "kettled" protesters at the G20 demonstrations in 2009, and also criticised the use of force by officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |title=Kettling of G20 protesters by police was illegal, high court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/14/kettling-g20-protesters-police-illegal |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor in the [[City of London]], died within a police cordon of the G20 Meltdown protest near the Bank of England. Initially the [[City of London Police]] denied that any incident with the police had occurred, and the death was attributed to natural causes.

The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) subsequently ordered a second post mortem and set up an independent criminal inquiry to determine whether Tomlinson was assaulted by police, and whether that assault contributed to his death.&lt;ref name=DoddApril8/&gt; The results of this second post mortem have revealed that Tomlinson actually died from an abdominal haemorrhage.

There are many known modeling [[paradigm]]s to describe the [[System dynamics|dynamics of system]] in [[Process-oriented programming|process-oriented]], [[Event-based programming|event-based]] and activity-based view points. Among those modeling paradigms, the activity-based modeling is a natural way to represent the activity paradigm of discrete event simulation and our knowledge about a system. In activity-based modeling,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc97papers/1127.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of system is represented as an ACD ('''activity cycle diagram''') which is a network model of the [[logic]]al and temporal relationships among the activities. An ACD is easily implemented with the activity scanning method of [[simulation]] execution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesimguy.com/articles/simModMeth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developing the activity cycle diagram ==

The methodology for constructing an activity cycle diagram consists of the following five steps :

#Specify the model domain.
#List all entities and their key attributes
#For each entity define its individual closed cycle of activity - queue - activity
#Merge the individual activity cycles
#Verify the logic of the diagram and amend as necessary.

The evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century.  Studies of benign hallucinatory experiences go back to 1886 and the early work of the [[Society for Psychical Research]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, E., Myers, F.W.H. and Podmore, F. (1886). ''Phantasms of the Living'', Vols. I and II. London: Trubner and Co..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, Eleanor; Johnson, Alice; and others (1894). Report on the Census  of Hallucinations,  London: ''Proceedings of the Society  for Psychical Research'', Vol. X.
&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested approximately 10% of the population had experienced at least one hallucinatory episode in the course of their life.  More recent studies have validated these findings; the precise incidence found varies with the nature of the episode and the criteria of "hallucination" adopted, but the basic finding is now well-supported.&lt;ref&gt;See Slade, P.D. and Bentall, R.P. (1988). ''Sensory Deception: a scientific analysis of hallucination''. London: Croom Helm, for a review.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Of particular interest, for reasons to be discussed below, are those anomalous experiences which are characterised by extreme perceptual realism.

===Apparitional experiences===

A common type of anomalous experience is the [[apparitional experience]], which may be defined as one in which a subject seems to perceive some person or thing that is not physically present.  Self-selected samples tend to report a predominance of human figures, but apparitions of animals,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Green, C., and McCreery, C. (1975). ''Apparitions''. London: Hamish Hamilton, pp. 192-196.&lt;/ref&gt; and even objects&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 197-199.&lt;/ref&gt; are also reported. Notably, the majority of the human figures reported in such samples are not recognised by the subject, and of those who are, not all are of deceased persons; apparitions of living persons have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Out-of-body experiences===

[[Out-of-body experiences]] (OBEs) have become to some extent conflated in the public mind with the concept of the [[near-death experience]].  However, the evidence suggests that the majority of out-of-body experiences do not occur near death, but in conditions of either very high or very low arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, H.J. (1985).  ''Flight of Mind: a psychological study of the out-of-body experience.'' Metuchen, New Jersey: The Scarecrow Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; McCreery &lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2008). Dreams and psychosis: a new look at an old hypothesis. ''Psychological Paper No. 2008-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/dreams-and-psychosis.pdf Online PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that this latter paradox may be explained by reference to the fact that sleep may be approached, not only by the conventional route of low arousal and deafferentation, but also by the less familiar route of extreme stress and hyper-arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, I. (1962). ''Sleeping and Waking: Physiology and Psychology.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; On this model OBEs represent the intrusion of Stage 1 sleep processes into waking consciousness.

OBEs can be regarded as hallucinatory in the sense that they are perceptual or quasi-perceptual experiences in which by definition the ostensible viewpoint is not coincident with the physical body of the subject.  Therefore, the normal sensory input, if any, that the subject is receiving during the experience cannot correspond exactly to the perceptual representation of the world in the subject's consciousness.

As with hallucinatory experiences in general, attempts to survey samples of the general population have suggested that such experiences are relatively common, incidence figures of between 15 and 25 percent being commonly reported.&lt;ref&gt;See Irwin, ''op.cit.,'' for a review.&lt;/ref&gt;  The variation is presumably to be accounted for by the different types of populations sampled and the different criteria of ‘out-of-body experience’ used.

===Dreams and lucid dreams===
{{Main|Dream|Lucid dream}}
A dream has been defined by some (e.g. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'') as a hallucinatory experience during sleep. &lt;!-- see here: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109540/dream --&gt;

A lucid dream may be defined as one in which the dreamer is aware that he or she is asleep and dreaming.  The term ‘lucid dream’ was first used by the Dutch physician Frederik van Eeden,&lt;ref&gt;van Eeden, F. (1913). A study of dreams. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', '''26''', Part 47, pp. 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt; who studied his own dreams of this type.  The word ‘lucid’ refers to the fact that the subject has achieved insight into his or her condition, rather than the perceptual quality of the experience.  Nevertheless, it is one of the features of lucid dreams that they can have an extremely high quality of perceptual realism, to the extent that the dreamer may spend time examining and admiring the perceptual environment and the way it appears to imitate that of waking life.&lt;ref&gt;See Green, C. (1968). ''Lucid Dreams.'' London: Hamish Hamilton, for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucid dreams by definition occur during sleep, but they may be regarded as hallucinatory experiences in the same way as non-lucid dreams of a vivid perceptual nature may be regarded as hallucinatory, that is they are examples of 'an experience having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation […]' &lt;ref&gt;Drever, (1952). ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

====False awakenings====

A [[false awakening]] is one in which the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green C. and McCreery C. (1994). ''Lucid Dreaming: the Paradox of Consciousness During Sleep''. London: Routledge. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the experience is so realistic perceptually (the sleeper seeming to wake in his or her own bedroom, for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory.  Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams.  However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of [[sleep paralysis]].

===Laboratory-induced hallucinations===
Psychotic-like symptoms, such as hallucinations and unusual perceptual experience, involve gross alterations in the experience of reality. Normal perception is substantially constructive and what we perceive  is strongly influenced by our prior experiences and expectancies.  Healthy individuals prone to hallucinations, or scoring highly on psychometric measures of positive [[schizotypy]],  tend to show a bias toward reporting stimuli that did not occur under perceptually ambiguous experimental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall R.P, &amp; Slade P.D. (1985). Reality testing and auditory hallucinations: a signal detection analysis. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', '''24''', 159 –169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Reed, P. (2005). Seeing words that are not there: detection biases in psychometric schizotypy. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', '''44''', 295-299&lt;/ref&gt;  During visual detection of fast-moving words, undergraduate students scoring highly on positive schizotypy had significantly high rates of false perceptions of words (i.e. reported seeing words that were not included in the experimental trials).&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Reed, P. (2005). Do positive schizotypal symptoms predict false perceptual experiences in non-clinical population? ''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'', '''193''', 809-812.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive schizotypal symptoms in healthy adults seem to predict false perceptions in laboratory tasks and certain environmental parameters such as perceptual load&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''41''', 951-958.&lt;/ref&gt; and frequency of visual targets &lt;ref&gt;Reed, P., Wakefield, D., Harris, J., Parry, J., Cella, M. &amp; Tsakanikos, E. (2008). Seeing non-existing events: effects of environmental conditions, schizotypal symptoms and sub-clinical characteristics. ''Journal of Behavior Therapy &amp; Experimental Psychiatry'', '''39''', 276-291.&lt;/ref&gt; are critical in the  generation of false perceptions. When detection of events becomes either effortless or [[Attention#Influence of Processing Load|cognitively demanding]], generation of such biases can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''41''', 951-958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtypes==

===Auditory hallucinations===
{{Main|Auditory hallucinations}}
Auditory hallucinations, and in particular the hearing of a voice, are thought of as particularly characteristic of people suffering from [[schizophrenia]].  However, normal subjects also report auditory hallucinations to a surprising extent.  For example, Bentall and Slade&lt;ref&gt;Bentall R.P. and Slade P.D. (1985).  Reliability of a scale measuring disposition towards hallucination:  a brief report.  ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''6''', 527 529.
&lt;/ref&gt; found that as many as 15.4% of a population of 150 male students were prepared to endorse the statement ‘In the past I have had the experience of hearing a person’s voice and then found that no one was there’.  They add: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘[…]no less than 17.5% of the [subjects] were prepared to score the item “I often hear a voice speaking my thoughts aloud” as “Certainly Applies”.  This latter item is usually regarded as a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia[…]’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Green and McCreery&lt;ref&gt;Green and McCreery, ''Apparitions'', ''op.cit. '' p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;  found that 14% of their 1800 self-selected subjects reported a purely auditory hallucination, and of these nearly half involved the hearing of articulate or inarticulate human speech sounds. An example of the former would be the case of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, ‘loudly and distinctly’: ‘You can’t do it, you know’.  He adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘It was so clear and resonant that I turned and looked at my companion who was gazing placidly at the screen[…] I was amazed and somewhat relieved when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard anything.’&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This case would be an example of what Posey and Losch&lt;ref&gt;Posey, T.B. and Losch, M.E. (1983).  Auditory hallucinations of hearing voices in 375 normal subjects.  ''Imagination, Cognition and Personality'', '''3''', 99-113.
&lt;/ref&gt; call ‘hearing a comforting or advising voice that is not perceived as being one’s own thoughts’. They estimated that approximately 10% of their population of 375 American college students had this type of experience.

It has been suggested that auditory hallucinations are affected by culture,  to the extent that when American subjects were examined they reported hearing stern authoritarian voices with violent or prohibitive suggestions,  whereas voices heard in India and Africa tended to be playful and collaborative instead.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Sense of presence===

This is a paradoxical experience in which the person has a strong feeling of the presence of another person, sometimes recognised, sometimes unrecognised, but without any apparently justifying sensory stimulus.

The nineteenth-century American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] described the experience thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;'From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those who have had it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive state of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as strong as any direct sensation ever gives. And yet no sensation seems to be connected with it at all... The phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure conception becoming saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations bring.'*&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890; 1950). ''Principles of Psychology'', Volume II. New York, Dover Publications, pp. 322-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an example of this type of experience: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’&lt;ref&gt;Green and McCreery, ''Apparitions'', ''op.cit''., p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experiences of this kind appear to meet all but one of the normal criteria of hallucination.  For example, Slade and Bentall proposed the following working definition of a hallucination: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘Any percept-like experience which (a) occurs in the absence of an appropriate stimulus, (b) has the full force or impact of the corresponding actual (real) perception, and (c) is not amenable to direct and voluntary control by the experiencer.’&lt;ref&gt;Slade and Bentall, op.cit., p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The experience quoted above certainly meets the second and third of these three criteria.  One might add that the ‘presence’ in such a case is experienced as located in a definite position in external physical space.  In this respect it may be said to be more hallucinatory than, for example, some [[hypnagogic imagery]], which may be experienced as external to the subject but located in a mental ‘space’ of its own.&lt;ref&gt;
 Leaning, F.E. (1925). An introductory study of hypnagogic phenomena. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', '''35''', 289-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mavromatis, A. (1987). ''Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other explanations for this phenomenon were discussed by the psychologist [[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]] who wrote that such experiences may involve [[illusion]], misinterpretation or [[suggestion]]. He noted that the experiences are usually reported at moments of fatigue, stress, or during the night.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Reed, Graham]]. (1988). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience''. Prometheus Books. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|0-87975-435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense of presence experiences in bereavement===

The experience of sensing the presence of a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in [[Grief|bereavement]]. It can take the form of a clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees&lt;ref&gt;
Rees, W.D. (1971). The hallucinations of widowhood.  ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', '''4''', 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study of 293 [[widow]]ed people living in a particular area of mid-[[Wales]].  He found that 14% of those interviewed reported having had a visual hallucination of their deceased [[Marriage|spouse]], 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the sample reported experiencing the presence of the deceased spouse. Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population.&lt;ref&gt;
Datson, S.L., &amp; Marwit, S.J. (1997). Personality constructs and perceived presence of deceased loved ones. ''[[Death Studies]]'', '''21''', 131-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Olson, P.R., Suddeth, J.A., Peterson, P.A., &amp; Egelhoff, C. (1985). Hallucinations of widowhood. ''Journal of the American Geriatric Society'', "33", 543-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensing the presence of the deceased may be a cross-cultural phenomenon that is, however, interpreted differently depending on the cultural context in which it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;
Steffen, E., &amp; Coyle, A. (2012). 'Sense of presence' experiences in bereavement and their relationship to mental health: A critical examination of a continuing controversy. In C. Murray (Ed.). ''Mental health and anomalous experience'', New York: Nova Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the earliest studies of the phenomenon published in a Western peer-reviewed journal investigated the [[grief]] experiences of Japanese widows and found that 90% of them reported to have sensed the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;
Yamamoto, J., Okonogi, K., I wasaki, T., &amp; Yoshimura, S. (1969). Mourning in Japan. ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', '''125''', 1660-1665.&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that, in contrast to Western interpretations, the widows were not concerned about their sanity and made sense of the experience in religious terms.

In the Western world, much of the bereavement literature of the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences as a form of denial, in the tradition of [[Freud]]'s interpretation in ''Mourning and Melancholia'' of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'.&lt;ref&gt;
Freud, S. (1917). Mourning and melancholia. In J. [[Strachey]] (Ed. and Trans.). ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. XIV)'' (pp. 252-268). London: Hogarth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) &lt;ref&gt;
Klass, D., Silverman, P.R., &amp; Nickman, S. (Eds.). (1996). ''Continuing bonds: New understandings of grief.'' Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways&lt;ref&gt;
Kwilecki, S. (2011). Ghosts, meaning, and faith: After-death communications in bereavement narratives. ''[[Death Studies]]", '''35''', 219-243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Steffen, E., &amp; Coyle, A. (2011). Sense of presence experiences and meaning-making in bereavement: A qualitative analysis.''[[Death Studies]]'', '''35''', 579-609.&lt;/ref&gt; While most of these experiences tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others,&lt;ref&gt;
Field, N.P., &amp; Filanosky, C. (2010). Continuing bonds, risk factors for complicated grief, and adjustment to bereavement. ''[[Death Studies]]'', '''34''', 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.

== Theoretical implications ==

===Psychological===
The main importance of anomalous experiences such as benign hallucinations to theoretical psychology lies in their relevance to the debate between the disease model versus the dimensional model of [[psychosis]].  According to the disease model, psychotic states such as those associated with [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic-depression]], represent symptoms of an underlying disease process, which is dichotomous in nature; i.e. a given subject either does or does not have the disease, just as a person either does or does not have a physical disease such as tuberculosis.  According to the dimensional model, by contrast, the population at large is ranged along a normally distributed continuum or dimension, which has been variously labelled as psychoticism ([[Eysenck|H.J.Eysenck]]), [[schizotypy]] ([[Gordon Claridge]]) or psychosis-proneness.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the concept of schizotypy and its variants, cf. McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''32''', 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of spontaneous hallucinatory experiences in persons who are enjoying good physical health at the time, and who are not drugged or in other unusual physical states of a transient nature such as extreme fatigue, would appear to provide support for the dimensional model.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (2005) On Fantastic Apparitions of Vision and Johannes Müller. ''History of Psychiatry'' 16: 229-246.&lt;/ref&gt;  The alternative to this view requires one to posit some hidden or latent disease process, of which such experiences are a symptom or precursor, an explanation which would appear to beg the question.

===Philosophical===

The "argument from hallucination" has traditionally been one of those used by proponents of the philosophical theory of [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism against direct realism]].  Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world we are not in direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness.  That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on.  Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.

Clearly, during an apparitional experience, for example, the correspondence between how the subject is perceiving the world and how the world really is at that moment is distinctly imperfect. At the same time the experience may present itself to the subject as indistinguishable from normal perception.  McCreery&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2006). "Perception and Hallucination: the Case for Continuity." ''Philosophical Paper No. 2006-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/perception.pdf Online PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that such empirical phenomena strengthen the case for representationalism as against direct realism.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|In [[Euclidean space]], a '''ball''' is the volume bounded by a sphere]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''ball''' is the space bounded by a [[sphere]]. It may be a '''closed ball''' (including the [[boundary points]] that constitute the sphere) or an '''open ball''' (excluding them).

These concepts are defined not only in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] but also for lower and higher dimensions, and for [[metric space]]s in general. A ''ball'' or '''hyperball''' in {{mvar|n}} dimensions is called an '''{{mvar|n}}-ball''' and is bounded by an [[N-sphere|'''({{math|''n'' − 1}})-sphere''']]. Thus, for example, a ball in the [[Euclidean plane]] is the same thing as a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], the area bounded by a [[circle]]. In [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]], a ball is taken to be the [[volume]] bounded by a [[2-sphere|2-dimensional sphere]]. In a [[one-dimensional space]], a ball is a [[line segment]].

In other contexts, such as in [[Euclidean geometry]] and informal use, ''sphere'' is sometimes used to mean ''ball''.

==Balls in Euclidean space==
In Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space, an (open) {{mvar|n}}-ball of radius {{mvar|r}} and center {{mvar|x}} is the set of all points of distance less than {{mvar|r}} from {{mvar|x}}. A closed {{mvar|n}}-ball of radius {{mvar|r}} is the set of all points of distance less than or equal to {{mvar|r}} away from {{mvar|x}}.

In Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space, every ball is bounded by a [[hypersphere]].  The ball is a bounded [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, is a '''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''' bounded by a [[circle]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, and is bounded by a [[sphere]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}.

=== Volume ===
{{main article|Volume of an n-ball|l1=Volume of an {{mvar|n}}-ball}}
The {{mvar|n}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{mvar|R}} in {{mvar|n}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:&lt;ref&gt;Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/,{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}R^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where&amp;nbsp;{{math|Γ}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]] (which can be thought of as an extension of the [[factorial]] function to fractional arguments). Using explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &amp;= \frac{\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}\,,\\
V_{2k+1}(R) &amp;= \frac{2^{k+1}\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \frac{2(k!)(4\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|1=(2''k'' + 1)!! = 1 · 3 · 5 · … · (2''k'' − 1) · (2''k'' + 1)}}.

==Balls in general metric spaces==
Let {{math|(''M'', ''d'')}} be a [[metric space]], namely a set {{mvar|M}} with a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (distance function) {{mvar|d}}. The open (metric) '''ball of radius''' {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}} centered at a point {{mvar|p}} in {{mvar|M}}, usually denoted by {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} or {{math|''B''(''p''; ''r'')}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p) = \{ x \in M \mid d(x,p) &lt; r \},&lt;/math&gt;

The closed (metric) ball, which may be denoted by {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}} or {{math|''B''[''p''; ''r'']}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_r[p] = \{ x \in M \mid d(x,p) \le r \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note in particular that a ball (open or closed) always includes {{mvar|p}} itself, since the definition requires {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}}.

The [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the open ball {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} is usually denoted {{math|{{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}}}}. While it is always the case that {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'') ⊆ {{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} ⊆ ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}}, it is {{em|not}} always the case that {{math|{{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} {{=}} ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}}. For example, in a metric space {{mvar|X}} with the [[discrete metric]], one has {{math|{{overline|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}} {{=}} {p&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''p''] {{=}} ''X''}}, for any {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X''}}.

A '''[[unit ball]]''' (open or closed) is a ball of radius 1.

A subset of a metric space is [[bounded set|bounded]] if it is contained in some ball. A set is [[totally bounded]] if, given any positive radius, it is covered by finitely many balls of that radius.

The open balls of a [[metric space]] can serve as a [[base (topology)|base]], giving this space a [[topological space|topology]], the open sets of which are all possible [[union (set theory)|union]]s of open balls. This topology on a metric space is called the '''topology induced by''' the metric {{mvar|d}}.

==Balls in normed vector spaces==
Any [[normed vector space]] {{mvar|V}} with norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is also a metric space with the metric &lt;math&gt;d (x,y)= \|x-y\|.&lt;/math&gt;  In such spaces, an arbitrary ball &lt;math&gt;B_r(y)&lt;/math&gt; of points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; around a point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with a distance of less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed as a scaled (by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) and translated (by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) copy of a ''unit ball'' &lt;math&gt;B_1(0).&lt;/math&gt; Such "centered" balls with &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; are denoted with &lt;math&gt;B(r).&lt;/math&gt;

The Euclidean balls discussed earlier are an example of balls in a normed vector space.

==={{mvar|p}}-norm===
In a [[Cartesian space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the [[p-norm|{{mvar|p}}-norm]] {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\left\| x \right\| _p = \left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dotsb + |x_n|^p \right) ^{1/p},&lt;/math&gt;

an open ball around the origin with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by the set

:&lt;math&gt; B(r) = \left\{ x \in \R^n \,:\left\| x \right\| _p = \left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dotsb + |x_n|^p \right) ^{1/p} &lt; r \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, in a 2-dimensional plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;, "balls" according to the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm (often called the ''[[Taxicab geometry|taxicab]]'' or ''Manhattan'' metric) are bounded by squares with their ''diagonals'' parallel to the coordinate axes; those according to the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm, also called the [[Chebyshev distance|Chebyshev]] metric, have squares with their ''sides'' parallel to the coordinate axes as their boundaries. The {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm, known as the Euclidean metric, generates the well known discs within circles, and for other values of {{mvar|p}}, the corresponding balls are areas bounded by [[Lamé curve]]s (hypoellipses or hyperellipses).

For {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}- balls are within octahedra with axes-aligned ''body diagonals'', the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}-balls are within cubes with axes-aligned ''edges'', and the boundaries of balls for {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''p'' &gt; 2}} are [[superegg|superellipsoids]]. Obviously, {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} generates the inner of usual spheres.

===General convex norm===
More generally, given any [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]], [[bounded set|bounded]], [[open set|open]], and [[convex set|convex]] subset {{mvar|X}} of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can define a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where the balls are all translated and uniformly scaled copies of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|X}}. Note this theorem does not hold if "open" subset is replaced by "closed" subset, because the origin point qualifies but does not define a norm on&amp;nbsp;{{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Topological balls==

One may talk about balls in any [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}, not necessarily induced by a metric. An (open or closed) {{mvar|n}}-dimensional '''topological ball''' of {{mvar|X}} is any subset of {{mvar|X}} which is [[homeomorphic]] to an (open or closed) Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-ball. Topological {{mvar|n}}-balls are important in [[combinatorial topology]], as the building blocks of [[cell complex]]es.

Any open topological {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to the Cartesian space {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and to the open [[hypercube|unit {{mvar|n}}-cube]] (hypercube) {{math|(0, 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Any closed topological {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to the closed {{mvar|n}}-cube {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

An {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to an {{mvar|m}}-ball if and only if {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''}}. The homeomorphisms between an open {{mvar|n}}-ball {{mvar|B}} and {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be classified in two classes, that can be identified with the two possible [[orientation (mathematics)|topological orientation]]s of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}.

A topological {{mvar|n}}-ball need not be [[differentiable manifold|smooth]]; if it is smooth, it need not be [[diffeomorphic]] to a Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-ball.

A '''basing diagram''' shows or describes the “pins” of an [[electronic component]]. This part usually has more than two pins, so a basing diagram is needed to show which pin does what. Many basing diagrams also show [[dimension]]s.

'''Bernard S. Benson''' (28 January 1922 – 15 May 1996) was an inventor and British author and writer of ''The Peace Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cv4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,3462405&amp;dq=bernard-benson+the-peace-book&amp;hl=en|title=Greene acquires a Canadian publisher |date=30 January 1982|publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|''Montreal Gazette'']]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a fighter pilot during World War II, and later worked on the design of early British missiles. He emigrated to the United States where at Douglas Aircraft Co., in Santa Monica, CA, he worked on the Douglas F4D Delta wing fighter and various Douglas missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Social Security Death Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VSVY-X44|publisher=familysearch|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 1950s, he founded [[Benson-Lehner Corporation]] with George F. G. Lehner, a psychology professor at UCLA.  Soon after its founding, futurist [[Donald Prell]] joined the company as Vice President, Application Engineering.  The new company was successful, as it filled a niche designing systems that were used to provide data input and output to and from the early computers.  The B/L machines semi-automatically read oscillograph and photographic flight test data producing punched tape and IBM punch cards which were then entered into computers.  After being processed, the data was then automatically printed on large flatbed graph-plotters.  This process automated the formerly manual reading and subsequent hand-plotting of data.  B/L plotters soon became the industry standard, and were sold worldwide. After an [[IPO]] the company expanded into the field of high speed photography.  Two photo-mechanical engineers, Guy Hearon and Harry Katt, were hired, who designed a series of 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm high speed cameras and accessories.

In 1961, Benson was one of the first persons to warn against the privacy risks raised by computers, claiming that digital data could one day be fed into a single system, leaving individuals at the mercy "of who or what controls the machine".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Fuster, Gloria González. 2014. The Emergence of Personal Data Protection as a Fundamental Right of the EU. Springer Science &amp; Business. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 1960s, Benson retired and moved to France, where he purchased the Chateau de Chaban located in the Dordogne.  While living there with his first wife Jane Lysbeth Saville Sneath and their seven children, he began writing children's books based on the philosophy of a group of Tibetan monks, who shared his estate.  Benson tried to make their philosophy readily understandable to both young and old. He then married Maryse Lheureux and had three daughters.

Books that were published included: ''The Minstrel'', an allegorical story about Elvis Presley, ''Alice in Plunderland'', ''Strictly Birdsmanship (or how to lay the egg that kills the golden goose)'', and  ''On Being an Egghead; or Engineersmanship for the Shell of it''.

&lt;!--PLEASE KEEP THIS ARTICLE FACTUAL AND NEUTRAL, NOT TURN IT INTO THE BERSIH 2.0 SUPPORTERS' BLOG.--&gt;
The '''Bersih 2.0 rally''' (also called the '''Walk for Democracy''') was a demonstration in [[Kuala Lumpur]] held on 9 July 2011 as a follow-up to the [[2007 Bersih rally]]. The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ([[Bersih]]), was supported by [[Pakatan Rakyat]], the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia, but was deemed illegal by the government. Bersih, chaired by former president of the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]], were pushing the [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) to ensure free and fair elections in Malaysia. It demanded that the EC clean up the electoral roll, reform postal voting, use indelible ink, introduce a minimum 21-day campaign period, allow all parties free access to the media, and put an end to electoral fraud.

The [[Royal Malaysia Police|police]] vowed to stop any rallies from taking place on the planned date on the grounds that all public gatherings without police permits are illegal. Having originally planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at [[Stadium Merdeka|Merdeka Stadium]] after consultations with the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], Malaysia's head of state.

Supporters of Bersih claim that demands for electoral reform made during the 2007 demonstration fell on deaf ears. [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] Youth and [[Perkasa]] planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit.

Estimates of the turnout ranged between 10,000 and over 20,000. The protestors were unable to congregate at Merdeka Stadium as many were forced to disperse by police who were heavily deployed throughout the city. Police arrested more than 1600 protestors, including [[Ambiga Sreenevasan|Ambiga]] and several opposition figures.

==Background==
The ruling coalition in Malaysia, [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN), which consists of parties representing the major racial groups in Malaysia, has won every federal election since independence in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia set for general election |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7283239.stm |work=BBC News   |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties and civil society organisations have long claimed that BN has been manipulating elections in its favour.&lt;ref name="walk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aliran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trans"/&gt;

[[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) deputy president [[Mohamad Sabu]] said there were many "concerns" about how the [[Next Malaysian general election|next general election]] will be conducted. He accused BN of cheating tactics, including registering foreign nationals as BN voters.&lt;ref name="walk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mat Sabu: Make Bersih rally a success |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/05/mat-sabu-make-bersih-rally-a-success/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=5 June 2011 |author=Tarani Palani |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS information chief Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the EC and the National Registration Department (NRD) "were committing abuses," and that there were "rampant media abuses."&lt;ref name="polact"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih: PAS repeats call for police to act on UMNO-Perkasa |url=http://en.harakahdaily.net/index.php/berita-utama/2965-bersih-pas-repeats-call-for-police-to-act-on-umno-perkasa.html |work=Harakah Daily |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) member of parliament [[Teresa Kok]] accused BN of "gerrymandering" and "malapportioning" electoral constituencies.&lt;ref name="kok"&gt;{{cite news |title=DAP pledges support for Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/dap-pledges-support-for-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=14 June 2011 |last=Chi |first=Melissa |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also pointed out how the opposition parties' share of seats in parliament was a lot less than their share of the popular vote.&lt;ref name="kok"/&gt; Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] claimed that BN would lose power if elections were free and fair.&lt;ref name="anwar1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Umno fears losing power in fair polls, says Anwar |url=http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/umno-fears-losing-power-in-fair-polls-says-anwar |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil society organisation Aliran claimed that there are "severe restrictions on political freedom" on opposition politicians in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="aliran"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Electoral Process |url=http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/hr/js9.html |publisher=Aliran |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It highlighted structural problems such as access to the media, short notices of election dates, and short campaign periods.&lt;ref name="aliran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upper"&gt;{{cite web |title=Elections: BN no longer has the upper hand! |url=http://aliran.com/1363.html |publisher=Aliran |date=2 August 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights group [[SUARAM]] also claim abuses by the ruling party such as [[gerrymandering]] constituencies, using public funds for projects to win political support, and the "unscrutinised" counting of [[postal ballot]]s.&lt;ref name="aliran"/&gt; [[Transparency International]]'s Malaysian branch, criticising both BN and opposition parties, spoke out against financial rewards promised by political parties to voters while campaigning, calling the practice "vote buying" and "corrupt."&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{cite news |title=Election handouts are bribes, says Transparency International |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/election-handouts-are-bribes-says-transparency-international/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 March 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests in Malaysia===
Street demonstrations are rare in Malaysia, but the public has become more vocal with the rise of alternative media and a resurgent opposition.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia police lock down capital ahead of protest |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/09/us-malaysia-protest-idUSTRE7680B720110709 |agency=Reuters   |date=9 July 2011 |author1=Niluksi Koswanage |author2=Razak Ahmad |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatherings in Malaysia of five or more people must receive a police permit, which is rarely granted.&lt;ref name="fingerprint"/&gt; The government has used heavy police presence to block rallies as well as arrest protest leaders to stop illegal public protests.

[[Bersih]], short for the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ({{lang-ms|Gabungan Pilihanraya '''Bersih''' dan Adil}}), is a coalition of 62 non-governmental organisations founded in November 2006.&lt;ref name="endorsees"&gt;{{cite web |title=Endorsees |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=14 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408101727/http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About BERSIH |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622172238/http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, Bersih has been supported by the three main opposition parties, [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), PAS, and DAP.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; ''Bersih'' is the Malay word for "clean"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bersih |url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=bersih |work=Dictionary |publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the claims of large scale corruption in the leading party.

The [[2007 Bersih rally|first Bersih rally]] on 10 November 2007 was estimated to have drawn between 30,000 and 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="aje1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police block Malaysia protest |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2007/12/2008525131234195960.html |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt; It was broken up by police using [[tear gas]] and chemical-laced [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="aje1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia police break up protest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7088877.stm |work=BBC News   |date=10 November 2007 |last=Brant |first=Robin |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was said to play a major role in helping the opposition parties make big gains in the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]].&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysian politics take to the streets |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/MF24Ae02.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=24 June 2011 |last=Netto |first=Anil |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih 2.0, as the organisation branded itself for the 2011 rally, is chaired by former [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] president [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]]. Ambiga served as president of the Bar from 2007 to 2009 and is a recipient of the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]'s International Women of Courage Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidents' Roll |url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/past_presidents.html |publisher=Malaysian Bar |accessdate=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remarks by Clinton on International Women of Courage Awards |url=http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2009/March/20090312132025xjsnommis0.1997949.html&amp;distid=ucs#ixzz1PtAnEl7f |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228192528/http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2009/March/20090312132025xjsnommis0.1997949.html%26distid%3Ducs#ixzz1PtAnEl7f |archive-date=28 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demands===
Ambiga has summed up the main issues raised by the organisation she leads as "unhappiness... in the [[Sarawak state election, 2011|Sarawak [election]]], unhappiness about corruption, [and] unhappiness about the independence of our institutions."&lt;ref name="go on"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally goes on, says Ambiga, PAS |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-goes-on-says-ambiga-pas/ |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043850/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-goes-on-says-ambiga-pas |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said demands made during the first rally in 2007 have not been addressed, hence the follow-up rally.&lt;ref name="politicians"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambiga asks politicians to join Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-asks-politicians-to-join-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613212007/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-asks-politicians-to-join-bersih-rally/ |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communiqué issued by Bersih issued in 2007 called for reforms to Malaysia's [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system, ensuring the independence of the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Election Commission]] (EC), eliminating electoral practices deemed unfair to opposition candidates, eliminating corrupt campaign practices, equal access to the media for all political parties, and instituting a [[caretaker government]] during election periods, among others in the long term.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Communiqué |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 |publisher=Bersih |date=23 November 2006 (updated July 2007) |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621011418/http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After agreeing to abandon plans for a street demonstration, Bersih also called for a [[Royal Commission]] into election practices.&lt;ref name="rci"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih wants supporters freed, RCI on election practices |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-wants-supporters-freed-rci-on-election-practices/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=6 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plans===
The rally's original plan was to have protestors gather at the KL Sogo shopping center, [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall]] building, and the [[Kampung Baru Mosque]] before marching to the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] to deliver a memorandum to the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].&lt;ref name="workwith"/&gt; After consultations with the King, Bersih decided to hold the rally in a stadium instead.&lt;ref name="nomarch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Street Protests Averted as Group Agrees to Use Stadium |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-05/malaysia-street-protests-averted-as-group-agrees-to-use-stadium.html |publisher=Bloomberg |date=5 July 2011 |last1=Gan |first1=Yen Kuan |last2=Ten Kate |first2=Daniel |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their request to use [[Merdeka Stadium]] was rejected by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police declines Bersih 2.0 permit application to hold rally at Merdeka Stadium |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/PolicedeclinesBersih2_0permitapplicationtoholdrallyatMerdekaStadium/Article/#ixzz1RWMOPfRh |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bersih accused the government of reneging on a previous offer to let them rally in a stadium instead of the streets.&lt;ref name="nostop"&gt;{{cite news |title=Government cannot stop us, says Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/government-cannot-stop-us-says-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=8 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih insisted on gathering at Merdeka Stadium, despite [[#Lockdown|preventative measures]] taken by police.&lt;ref name="nostop"/&gt;

==Lead-up to the rally==

===Announcement===
After frustration at by being shut out of [[Election monitoring|observing]] the [[Sarawak state election, 2011|April 2011 Sarawak election]], Bersih announced in a press release on 26 May that it had decided to organise a gathering on 9 July to press for electoral reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bersih 2.0: Deportation of activist from Sarawak and announcement of ‘Perhimpunan Rakyat’ |url=http://bersih.org/?p=3844 |publisher=Bersih |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-rallies===

====Perkasa====
[[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay Supremacy]] movement [[Perkasa]] spoke out strongly against the rally.&lt;ref name="perkasa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Perkasa vows counter-protest against Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/perkasa-vows-counter-protest-against-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=13 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June, Perkasa announced that it had secured the support of over 30 non-governmental organisations and challenged Bersih organisers over who could stage a bigger rally on 9 July.&lt;ref name="gauntlet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Let’s see who’s bigger, Perkasa dares Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/lets-see-whos-bigger-perkasa-dares-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=15 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called on Bersih to cancel its rally, warning that clashes might occur.&lt;ref name="permit"/&gt; Perkasa president [[Ibrahim Ali (Malaysia)|Ibrahim Ali]] warned "[If they proceed] there will be a clash.

===Election Commission reaction===
Bersih's demands were repeatedly dismissed by the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Election Commission]] (EC), who sought to tie the organisation to the opposition's agenda.&lt;ref name="ec3"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC: Bersih intends to overthrow govt |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/30/ec-bersih-intends-to-overthrow-govt/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=30 June 2011 |last=Sta Maria |first=Stephanie |accessdate=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701100814/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/30/ec-bersih-intends-to-overthrow-govt/ |archive-date=1 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar claimed Bersih was working with [[Pakatan Rakyat]] to "overthrow the government."&lt;ref name="ec3"/&gt; In turn, Ambiga criticised the EC's conduct, asking them to remain independent from politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambiga tells EC to remain neutral |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-tells-ec-to-remain-neutral/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 June 2011 |last=Yow |first=Hong Chieh |accessdate=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701182220/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-tells-ec-to-remain-neutral/ |archive-date=1 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June, the EC extended an offer to Bersih to meet and discuss its demands, on the condition that the rally be called off.

===International response===
On 5 July, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] voiced concern about the restriction of freedom of expression in Malaysia and urged the government to release detained Bersih activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysia: UN rights office concerned at reported crackdown ahead of planned protests |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38935&amp;Cr=expression&amp;Cr1 |publisher=UN |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandmaster of the Malaysian [[Silat|Silat Lincah]] Organisation (PSSLM) reportedly threatened to "wage war" against Bersih activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Silat guru to hold 'war' talks tomorrow |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/01/silat-guru-to-hold-war-talks-tomorrow/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=1 July 2011 |author=Syed Jaymal Zahiid |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Najib subsequently endorsed silat groups, including PSSLM.&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia braces for pro-democracy street protests in Kuala Lumpur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/08/malaysia-democracy-street-protests |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=8 July 2011 |last=Hodal |first=Kate |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yang di-Pertuan Agong's intervention===
Malaysia's head of state, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], [[Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin]], issued a statement on 3 July urging moderation by all parties. He said "street demonstrations bring more bad than good although the original intention is good," and called for Bersih to resolve its differences with the government peacefully. He also expressed confidence in Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King issues statement on Bersih 2.0 rally |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/3/nation/20110703233907&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=3 July 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 14:00, Bersih and Pakatan Rakyat leaders began their march towards Merdeka Stadium.

One death was reported. Protestor Baharuddin Ahmad accidentally inhaled tear gas fired by police.

==Aftermath==
National laureate [[A. Samad Said]] called the rally a "great success", lauding the multiracial unity among the protestors.&lt;ref name="greatsucess"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih says 50,000 protested, declares rally ‘great success’ |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-says-50000-protested-declares-rally-great-success/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiga, speaking after being released, congratulated those who attended the rally, saying "we were not intimidated."&lt;ref name="syabas"/&gt; The Bersih leadership commended protestors for behaving peacefully and condemned the police for reacting harshly to the demonstration.&lt;ref name="bersihstatement"&gt;{{cite news |title=This is just the beginning, says polls coalition |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169403 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said the gathering was "not the end, it is but one more step in the long walk for clean and fair elections in Malaysia."&lt;ref name="bersihstatement"/&gt;

Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] said the rally was a "success" despite "police brutality."&lt;ref name="bruisecut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anwar: I suffered a bruise and a cut leg |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169433 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=9 July 2011 |author=AFP |authorlink=Agence France Presse |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAP secretary-general [[Lim Guan Eng]] said the "police abuse" was "a big blow to the image of Malaysia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guan Eng: Police abuse at rally bad image for M'sia |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169454 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=10 July 2011 |last=Loone |first=Susan |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] downplayed the rally, insisting it only represented a minority of the population.&lt;ref name="najibreaction"&gt;{{cite news |title=Najib: Let illegal rally be a lesson to the people |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/10/nation/9074694&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said the anti-government sentiment among the protestors confirmed the government's fears that Bersih's agenda had been hijacked by the opposition.&lt;ref name="najibreaction"/&gt; Home Minister [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] praised the police for keeping the rally under control and said the rally revealed itself to be an opposition plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally lost direction, says Hishammuddin |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-lost-direction-says-hishammuddin/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=9 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States expressed concern over the crackdown. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] spokesman Mark Toner said "We stand for... the right for people to freely express their democratic aspirations and express their views freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US concern at Malaysia crackdown on protests |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14149828 |work=BBC News |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International released a statement saying: "This brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters is undermining Malaysia’s claim to be a moderate democracy. Mr. Najib’s government has chosen the path of repression, not reform."&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; Lawyers for Liberty released a statement saying that the police deliberately shot gas canisters against the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169623&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform proposals===
On 15 August 2011, Najib announced that a parliamentary select committee will be formed to examine the electoral system. He said the committee will consist of members of parliament from both the government and opposition coalition who will discuss electoral reform issues "so that a mutual agreement can be reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In nod to Bersih, PM announces vote system relook |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pm-announces-bi-partisan-panel-to-study-vote-system/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=15 August 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Malaysia Day]] 2011 address in September, Najib announced the government's intentions to repeal the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]], [[Emergency Ordinance]], remove the annual renewal of press and publication permits, and review Section 27 of the [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM announces repeal of ISA, three Emergency proclamations |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/9/15/nation/20110915205714&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101122631/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F9%2F15%2Fnation%2F20110915205714&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 January 2012 |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the government tabled the [[Peaceful Assembly Act]] to replace Section 27 of the Police Act.&lt;ref name="nst1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gathering in peace |url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/editorial/gathering-in-peace-1.9695 |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123165426/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/editorial/gathering-in-peace-1.9695 |archive-date=23 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage and analysis==

===Pre-rally===
The lead-up to the rally has received polarising coverage in Malaysia's print and internet news media. Malaysia's print media are subject to the [[Printing Presses and Publications Act]], which stipulates they can only publish with a license granted by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malaysia |url=http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/archive/transition/issue07/malaysia.htm |work=Communications Law in Transition Newsletter |publisher=Oxford University, [[Yeshiva University]] |volume=1 |number=7 |date=4 September 2000 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724150414/http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/archive/transition/issue07/malaysia.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A news website has alleged that the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] instructed radio and television stations to omit coverage of police violence and focus on the damage done by rally participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Govt to media: Black out police violence during rally |url=http://en.harakah.net.my/index.php/berita-utama/3046-govt-to-media-black-out-police-violence-during-rally.html |work=Harakah Daily |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State news agency [[Bernama]] quoted several political analysts saying that the rally will tarnish Malaysia's image abroad and is a distraction from [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s ongoing [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials|sodomy trials]]. It claimed the 1998 demonstrations against Anwar's arrest and the 2007 Bersih rally caused "inconvenience to the public and damage to public property, attracting bad publicity from the international media." One analyst said elections are "already fair as fair can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Illegal assembly will tarnish Malaysia’s good image: Analysts |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/23/nation/20110623171618&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=23 June 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernama also reported analysts saying that Ambiga has a history of provoking Muslims and working against interests of the Malay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malays should know who Ambiga is, say analysts |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/26/malays-should-know-who-ambiga-is-say-analysts/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=26 June 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=26 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627032803/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/26/malays-should-know-who-ambiga-is-say-analysts/ |archive-date=27 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Print media====
''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'', a newspaper owned by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), a governing party, criticised the rally as "dirty" on a 12 June editorial. In particular, it made reference to Anwar's sodomy trial and sex video allegations, calling him a hypocrite and urging Malaysians to protest against the opposition leader instead. It also warned against disunity among [[Malay people|Malays]], and claimed that the DAP, backed strongly by Chinese constituents, would benefit most from the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan says Bersih dirty, calls for boycott |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-says-bersih-dirty-calls-for-boycott/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Utusan'' reported that 70 percent of the 1000 who attended the Bersih 2.0 pre-launch on 19 June were non-Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=70 peratus bukan Melayu hadir |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0621&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_06.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper has also portrayed the rally as anti-Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bukan budaya Islam |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0701&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_09.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |language=Malay |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quoted pro-UMNO political analysts attacking Ambiga for "angering Muslims and Malays,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan demonises Ambiga ahead of Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-demonises-ambiga-ahead-of-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=26 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reported that foreign Christian organisations are funding the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan says foreign Christian funds behind Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-says-foreign-christian-funds-behind-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=27 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tay Tian Yan wrote in the ''[[Sin Chew Daily]]'', the highest circulated daily in Malaysia, that the rally is a repeat scenario of the 2007 protest, where the opposition cashed in on public discontent over rising prices and staged the rally to generate momentum ahead of the general election. He also noted that the counter-rally by UMNO Youth is a ploy by BN to mitigate the Bersih rally's momentum, as opposed to suppressing the rally outright, which he said would swing public opinion against BN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Massive mobilisation |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/59071 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=20 June 2011 |last=Tay |first=Tuan Yan |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lim Sue Goan noted the involvement of Pakatan Rakyat and UMNO in opposite rallies, and said the event has grown from becoming a mere march to demand free elections to a political showdown between the government and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political struggle |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/59584 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=28 June 2011 |last=Lim |first=Sue Goan |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 22 June editorial, [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']], owned by the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), also a governing party, said opposition parties are colluding with the rally's organisers to discredit the authorities in an attempt to gain support ahead of the elections. It accused Bersih of "[creating] cynical distrust in the authorities to give [themselves] and their political ringleaders a psychological advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih 2.0 rally is still politics all the same |url=http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?col=thestarsays&amp;file=/2011/6/22/columnists/thestarsays/8949840&amp;sec=The%20Star%20Says |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johan Jaaffar, chairman of Media Prima (owned by UMNO), the parent company of the ''[[New Straits Times]]'', wrote in the paper: "The government of the day is not perfect. So, too, the system... we don't solve problems on the streets. That's not us, nor our way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We don't solve problems on the streets |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/19joja/Article/#ixzz1RZbx0HPC |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=7 July 2011 |author=Johan Jaaffar |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M Faqih, writing in the PAS organ ''Harakah Daily'', compared the planned rally to the September 1998 protests in Kuala Lumpur against then-deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s sacking and detention on sodomy and corruption charges, which he described as peaceful unlike the [[Tunisian revolution|revolutions in Tunisia]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]]. He called on the opposition to seize the initiative with public discontent over government policies and use the rally as a stepping stone to victory in next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=9 Julai penentu akhir tarikh PRU 13 |url=http://bm.harakahdaily.net/index.php/articles/analysis-a-opinion/3879-9-julai-penentu-akhir-tarikh-pru-13- |work=Harakah Daily |author=M Faqih |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet news====
Josh Hong of ''[[Malaysiakini]]'' questioned the law requiring protest organisers to obtain permits, saying the freedom of speech and right to assembly are guaranteed by the Constitution. He also criticised the government's record of cracking down civil rights campaigners and political activists and the mainstream media's demonisation of the Bersih rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Najib is losing the plot&amp;nbsp;– again |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/169311 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=8 July 2011 |last=Hong |first=Josh |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow columnists Mariam Mokhtar and Dean Johns criticised the government's crackdown on Bersih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The follies of Umno and the EC |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/168837 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=4 July 2011 |author=Mariam Mokhtar |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Let them eat dirt' |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/169047 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=5 July 2011 |last=Johns |first=Dean |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News website ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'' called the government's tough stand against the Bersih rally "double standards," deriding the government's non-action against Ibrahim Ali, who had earlier called for [[jihad]] against Christians. It also blamed the police for the chaos that occurred during the 2007 rally and dismissed the government's concern for national security and threat to tourism as self-caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Putrajaya’s double standards&amp;nbsp;– The Malaysian Insider |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/putrajayas-double-standards-the-malaysian-insider/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website reported analysts saying the rally will help PAS cement the growing support the party has gained among the Malay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For PAS, Bersih rally catalyst to lead Malay vote |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/for-pas-bersih-rally-catalyst-to-lead-malay-vote/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=27 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Free Malaysia Today'', another news website, argued in favour of the rally, saying that concerns that it will serve as a "spring offensive" to overthrow the government are exaggerated. It lamented what it perceived as Malaysia's flawed democracy, saying "[there] are two ways to punish political perverts who have raped democracy: vote them out or take to the streets." It also criticised the government for threatening to clamp down on protestors, saying that the ruling coalition is using public order as an excuse to preserve its stay in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don’t walk away from democracy |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/21/dont-walk-away-from-democracy/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another editorial the day before the rally, FMT was highly critical of the government, asking the people to "decide the course of history" and defy a "harsh and repressive" state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=People, the choice is yours |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/08/people-the-choice-is-yours/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International====
In an op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', former US ambassador to Malaysia John R. Malott said Najib's UMNO is "running scared" of losing power and is waging a campaign of intimidation against Bersih. He called the protest "a brave step" towards the country's transition to full democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Running Scared in Malaysia |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576431443001815406?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=8 July 2011 |last=Malott |first=John R. |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Clive Kessler of the University of New South Wales in an interview with ABC Radio stated that the Agong's intervention was a rebuke to Umno and the government and an acknowledgement of Bersih’s legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/06/a-royal-rebuke-for-umno-says-aussie-don/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710134614/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/06/a-royal-rebuke-for-umno-says-aussie-don/ |archive-date=10 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to the rally===
Newspapers owned by Barisan Nasional parties were highly critical of the rally, accusing Bersih of disturbing the peace.&lt;ref name="printattack"&gt;{{cite news |title=Print media attacks Bersih, praises cops |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/print-media-attacks-bersih-praises-cops/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=10 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' called the police operation to foil the illegal rally a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Polis berjaya kekang Bersih |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0710&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_01.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']] remarked in an editorial the following day: "If every complaint made one or the other party take to the streets, bringing a city to a standstill, people would not be getting much work done." It said Bersih achieved the publicity it sought, and that everyone should move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The game is over, time for everybody to move on |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/10/nation/9074695&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Straits Times]]'' said there was "no winner in this madness" as many were hurt, and "Bersih's intentions were hijacked by the opposition coalition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No winner in this madness |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/2bek/Article/#ixzz1Rfkmctle |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NST's 10 July front page featured a photo of a protestor throwing an object with the headline "Peaceful?"&lt;ref name="printattack"/&gt;

''[[The Malaysian Insider]]''{{'}}s Debra Chong said Najib's administration "took a massive punch to its gut," as accounts of police personnel using tear gas and water cannons against unarmed civilians were reported by international media. She said the rally showed the willingness of the middle class and civil society to stand up to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Today, Malaysians revisit Bersih 2007 |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/today-malaysians-revisit-bersih-2007/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=9 July 2011 |last=Chong |first=Debra |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMI's Sheridan Mahavera said the rally was a display of racial unity.&lt;ref name="mahavera"&gt;{{cite news |title=In Bersih, an elusive Malaysian unity appears |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/in-bersih-an-elusive-malaysian-unity-appears/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=10 July 2011 |author=Sheridan Mahavera |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeswan Kaur of ''Free Malaysia Today'' said Najib and the police were to blame for the chaotic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally revealed lots of truth |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/10/bersih-rally-revealed-lots-of-truth/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=10 July 2011 |author=Jeswan Kaur |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim Suffian, head of the Merdeka Center, an independent think tank, said the actions of Bersih and the government polarised Malaysians of opposite political opinions. "For Pakatan Rakyat supporters, it has just increased their scepticism of the [BN-ruled] government. For those who are pro-government, it has hardened their belief that the PR is out to cause trouble."&lt;ref name="mahavera"/&gt; One analyst accused Barisan Nasional of abusing public institutions to protect its power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BN slammed for ‘feudal politics’ |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/10/bn-slammed-for-%E2%80%98feudal-politics%E2%80%99/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=10 July 2011 |author=Athi Shankar |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another added that "the police lost more credibility than the protesters."&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

International reaction was unanimously critical of the government. The Singapore [[The Straits Times|''Straits Times'']] added that Malaysian society has been polarised by the country’s divisive politics as clearly demonstrated when thousands braved a security lockdown of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/singapore-daily-says-najib-umno-badly-bruised-by-bersih-crackdown/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143524/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/singapore-daily-says-najib-umno-badly-bruised-by-bersih-crackdown/ |archive-date=13 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the [[The Jakarta Post|''Jakarta Post'']] described Malaysia as a "rich but not free" country, with its leaders still "laboring under an old paradigm" and refusing to allow its people to exercise their rights to free speech by invoking racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/11/editorial-malaysia-rich-not-free.html|title=Malaysia: Rich, but not free|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera English]]'s [[Teymoor Nabili]] said the government acted out of fear of an Egypt-style revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia's fear of Egypt |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/asia/2011/07/08/malaysias-fear-egypt |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=9 July 2011 |last=Nabili |first=Teymoor |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] columnist William Pesek calls the rally a part of the "rising call for political change in Asia" that play a decisive role in foreign investment to Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-12/investing-101-means-looking-out-the-windows-more-william-pesek.html|last=Pesek|first=William|title=Investing 101 Means Looking Out the Windows More|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian Sentinel stated that although Najib Tun Razak appears to have won the battle by closing down Kuala Lumpur on Saturday and arresting 1,667 mostly peaceful marchers and would-be marchers, the consensus seems to be that Malaysia has suffered a blow to its international reputation as a moderate, democratic country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3307&amp;Itemid=251&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Simon Tisdall slammed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's harsh treatment towards the peaceful rally participants, noting that the British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] should tell Najib that "strong-arm tactics against protesters are unacceptable" and that "Malaysia's leaders should wake up and smell the coffee".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/13/malaysia-najib-cameron-protesters Malaysia's Najib must abandon the Mubarak model]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
''[[The Economist]]''{{'}}s coverage of the rally was partially censored by the government. Four lines in the article titled "Taken to the cleaners – an overzealous government response to an opposition rally" was inked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Home Ministry censors Bersih article in The Economist |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/home-ministry-censors-bersih-article-in-the-economist/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=19 July 2011 |first=Clara |last=Chooi |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Najib later admitted that censoring parts of the article was a mistake which generated negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Najib: Censorship no longer ‘effective’, needs review |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-censorship-no-longer-effective-needs-review/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=15 August 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Election Commission===
The [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) has dismissed Bersih's claims, saying that it has already met the organisation's demands. EC chairman Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof, who met with Bersih officials in December 2010, slammed Bersih chairman Ambiga's knowledge of voter registration as "shallow."&lt;ref name="spr"&gt;{{cite news |title=SPR jawab tuntutan 'Bersih' |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0614&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Rencana&amp;pg=re_01.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |author=Zulkifli Jalil |language=Malay |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abdul Aziz also claimed that Bersih had a political agenda, saying that the opposition parties were propping up the organisation.&lt;ref name="ec1"/&gt; He claimed the opposition were using the EC as a scapegoat for political gain.&lt;ref name="scapegoat"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC tells Bersih: Don’t make EC a scapegoat |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/20/nation/20110620190723&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=20 June 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to demands====
* Responding to Bersih's demand that voter registration be automatic once a citizen reaches voting age, Abdul Aziz said such a proposal would contravene [[:s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 119|Article 119 (4)]] of the Constitution, which he claims clearly states that registration as a voter can only be done through application by the voter him/herself.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt; EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar added that unregistered voters are "indifferent," and will not bother to vote anyway.&lt;ref name="ec2"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC shoots down Bersih’s demands ahead of rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-shoots-down-bersihs-demands-ahead-of-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abdul Aziz also defended against allegations that the EC is lackadaisical in tackling [[Ghost voter|phantom voting]]. He said that the EC cannot strike names of dead voters off the electoral roll unless the family of a dead voter requests it and produces the dead voter's death certificate.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt; He also blamed allegations of voting in multiple constituencies on voters who refuse to change the addresses on their identification cards when they move homes.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt;
* Wan Ahmad said the use of [[indelible ink]] is "regressive" and only practised in less developed countries. He also raised the possibility of voters not wanting their fingers inked and voters who somehow inked their fingers before voting.&lt;ref name="ec2"/&gt; Abdul Aziz said the EC was considering a [[biometric]] [[fingerprint]]ing system instead.&lt;ref name="fingerprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;
* Wan Ahmad said a 21-day campaign period is "unnecessary" as Malaysia has a relatively small land area and population.&lt;ref name="ec2"/&gt;

===Government===
The rally has been roundly criticised by government politicians, who claim that the opposition are using the rally, purportedly a non-partisan protest, to advance its own political agenda.&lt;ref name="muhyiddin1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muhyiddin says opposition using Bersih rally to topple BN |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/muhyiddin-says-opposition-using-bersih-rally-to-topple-bn/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=18 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih Assembly Only to Serve the Political Agenda of Opposition Parties |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/bersih-assembly-only-serve-political-agenda-opposition-parties-063824776.html |work=[[Yahoo!

Prime minister Najib said claims that elections are unfair "did not make sense," adding that the opposition are using instability to their political advantage.&lt;ref name="najib1"/&gt; He challenged them to take on the government in the polls instead.&lt;ref name="najib1"/&gt; The Home Minister, Hishamuddin, responding to early reports announcing the rally, criticised public demonstrations in particular.&lt;ref name="clean up"/&gt; He slammed Bersih for trying to "instill hatred" and "show the world that our country is chaotic."&lt;ref name="clean up"/&gt; Deputy Prime Minister [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] said the planned rally is "undemocratic" and claimed that it is supported only by a small segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally undemocratic, says Muhyiddin |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-undemocratic-says-muhyiddin/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=16 June 2011 |author=Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also warned of foreign powers taking advantage of instability in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DPM warns of outside interference |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/02/dpm-warns-of-outside-interference/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=2 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UMNO===
UMNO's information chief [[Ahmad Maslan]] said that the event might risk damaging the economy and national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Umno against Bersih 2.0, says info chief |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/umno-against-bersih-2.0-says-info-chief/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO Youth leader Khairy Jamaluddin said Anwar's attempts to exert influence over the rally on 19 June was proof that Bersih was "compromised" by the opposition.&lt;ref name="compromised"/&gt; UMNO Youth executive council member Tengku Azman Tengku Zainol Abidin said public rallies should not be held on the streets and that the 2007 Bersih rally "achieved nothing."&lt;ref name="polrpt"/&gt;

Anwar's former political secretary [[Dewan Negara|Senator]] Ezam Mohd Noor called Anwar a hypocrite, saying that Anwar's own PKR party election in 2010 was rife with allegations of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Khairy: ‘Stock up’ statement a threat to Chinese community |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/21/nation/8941713&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perkasa===
Perkasa has criticised the rally for threatening to spread chaos,&lt;ref name="perkasa"/&gt; claiming that the opposition will use the rally to trigger an uprising similar to [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]].&lt;ref name="spectre"/&gt; Perkasa president [[Ibrahim Ali (Malaysia)|Ibrahim Ali]] also threw his support behind the EC, arguing that they had already answered demands for free and fair elections.&lt;ref name="gauntlet"/&gt; [[Ibrahim Ali (Malaysia)|Ibrahim Ali]] also warned Chinese community should avoid joining this rally and stay away from it by keeping food at home.

===Independents===
"Independent" Member of Parliament [[Zulkifli Nordin]] questioned the need for the rally, claiming that democracy was already "alive," citing the result of the previous election as an example.&lt;ref name="perkasa"/&gt; Fellow independent MP [[Wee Choo Keong]] hinted that Bersih's cause is "politically motivated," and advised Ambiga to join a political party instead of "hiding behind a non-governmental organisation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Go join a political party, Wee tells Ambiga |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/15/nation/8901511&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
Sections of the business community initially condemned the proposed street rally, arguing that business operators would have suffered losses on 9 July, a Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group: Bersih demo will be bad for business |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/25/nation/8975159&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=25 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the groups opposed to the rally were the KL and Selangor Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Business community ‘no’ to planned Bersih rally |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/06/23/business-community-%E2%80%98no%E2%80%99-to-planned-bersih-rally/ |work=Borneo Post |date=23 June 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Malaysian Associated Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian businesses strongly against street demos |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/30/nation/9000836&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Executive Taxi Owners' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cabbies rally against Bersih march |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/30/nation/8999247&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UMNO encouraged business operators and taxi drivers to sue Bersih for any losses that may be caused by the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Golongan terjejas dinasihat saman Bersih |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0615&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_04.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |language=Malay |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16092">'''Debiasing''' is the reduction of bias, particularly with respect to [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|judgment and decision making]]. [[List of cognitive biases|Biased judgment and decision making]] is that which systematically deviates from the prescriptions of objective standards such as facts, logic, and [[Rational choice theory|rational behavior]] or prescriptive [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Biased judgment and decision making exists in consequential domains such as medicine, law, policy, and business, as well as in everyday life. [[disposition effect|Investors, for example, tend to hold onto falling stocks too long and sell rising stocks too quickly]]. Employers exhibit considerable discrimination in hiring and employment practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=0 | title=Racial Bias, Even When We Have Good Intentions | work=The New York Times | date=January 3, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2016 | author=Mullainathan, Sendhil}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many parents continue to believe that vaccinations cause autism despite knowing that this link is based on falsified evidence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Morewedge|first1 = C.

Debiasing can occur within the decision maker. For example, a person may learn or adopt better strategies by which to make judgments and decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larrick|first1=Richard|title=Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-4051-0746-4|pages=316|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debiasing can also occur as a result of changes in external factors, such as changing the incentives relevant to a decision or the manner in which the decision is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunstein|first1=Richard H. Thaler, Cass R.|title=Nudge : improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300122237|edition=Revised and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three general approaches to debiasing judgment and decision making, and the costly errors with which biased judgment and decision making is associated: changing [[incentive]]s, [[Nudge theory|nudging]], and training. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses. For more details, see Morewedge and colleagues (2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== General approaches ==

=== Incentives ===
Changing [[incentive]]s can be an effective means to debias judgment and decision making. This approach is generally derived from [[Rational choice theory|economic theories]] suggesting that people act in their self-interest by seeking to maximize their utility over their lifetime. Many decision making biases may occur simply because they are more costly to eliminate than to ignore.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Costs and benefits of judgment errors: Implications for debiasing.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.486|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 486–498|volume = 110|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.486|first = Hal R.|last = Arkes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making people more accountable for their decisions (increasing incentives), for example, can increase the extent to which they invest cognitive resources in making decisions, leading to less biased decision making when people generally have an idea of how a decision should be made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lerner|first1=Jennifer S.|last2=Tetlock|first2=Philip E.|title=Accounting for the effects of accountability.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1999|volume=125|issue=2|pages=255–275|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "bias" might not be the appropriate term for these types of decision making errors.  These "strategy-based" errors occur simply because the necessary effort outweighs the benefit.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If a person makes a suboptimal choice based on an actual bias, then incentives may exacerbate the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An incentive in this case may simply cause the person to perform the suboptimal behavior more enthusiastically.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Incentives can be calibrated to change preferences toward more beneficial behavior. Price cuts on healthy foods increase their consumption in school cafeterias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=SA|title=Pricing effects on food choices.|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=2003|volume=133|issue=3|pages=841S-843S|pmid=12612165|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/3/841S.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soda taxes appear to reduce soda consumption by the public. People often are willing to use incentives to change their behavior through the means of a commitment device. Shoppers, for example, were willing to forego a cash back rebate on healthy food items if they did not increase the percentage of healthy foods in their shopping baskets.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=J.|last2=Mochon|first2=D.|last3=Wyper|first3=L.|last4=Maroba|first4=J.|last5=Patel|first5=D.|last6=Ariely|first6=D.|title=Healthier by Precommitment|journal=Psychological Science|date=3 January 2014|volume=25|issue=2|pages=538–546|doi=10.1177/0956797613510950|pmid=24390824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incentives can backfire when they are miscalibrated or are weaker than social norms that were preventing undesirable behavior. Large incentives can also lead people to choke under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariely|first1=Dan|last2=Gneezy|first2=Uri|last3=Loewenstein|first3=George|last4=Mazar|first4=Nina|title=Large Stakes and Big Mistakes|journal=Review of Economic Studies|date=April 2009|volume=76|issue=2|pages=451–469|doi=10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00534.x|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/SITE/archive/SITE_2006/Web%20Session%207/Ariely_Paper.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202540/http://web.stanford.edu/group/SITE/archive/SITE_2006/Web%20Session%207/Ariely_Paper.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nudges ===
[[Nudge theory|Nudges]], changes in information presentation or the manner by which judgments and decisions are elicited, is another means to debiasing. People may choose healthier foods if they are better able to understand their nutritional contents,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The impact of traffic light color-coding on food health perceptions and choice.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xap0000049|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|pages = 255–275|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/xap0000049|first = Remi|last = Trudel|first2 = Kyle B.|last2 = Murray|first3 = Soyoung|last3 = Kim|first4 = Shuo|last4 = Chen|date= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may choose lower-calorie meals if they are explicitly asked if they would like to downsize their side orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=J.|last2=Riis|first2=J.|last3=Elbel|first3=B.|last4=Ariely|first4=D.|title=Inviting Consumers To Downsize Fast-Food Portions Significantly Reduces Calorie Consumption|journal=Health Affairs|date=8 February 2012|volume=31|issue=2|pages=399–407|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of nudges include changing which option is the [[Default effect (psychology)|default]] option to which people will be assigned if they do not choose an alternative option, placing [[Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule|a limit on the serving size of soda]], or automatically enrolling employees in a retirement savings program.

=== Training ===
Training can effectively debias decision makers over the long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How a Video Game Helped People Make Better Decisions|url = https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-a-video-game-helped-people-make-better-decisions|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judgment and Decision Making as a Skill: Learning, Development and Evolution|last = Dhami|first = Mandeep|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9781107676527|location = |pages = |url = http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/judgment-and-decision-making-skill-learning-development-and-evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training, to date, has received less attention by academics and policy makers than incentives and nudges because initial debiasing training efforts resulted in mixed success (see Fischhoff, 1982 in Kahneman et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Debiasing|first1=Baruch|last1=Fischhoff|editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521284141|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Judgment_Under_Uncertainty.html?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;pg=PA422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Decision makers could be effectively debiased through training in specific domains. For example, experts can be trained to make very accurate decisions when decision making entails [[Recognition primed decision|recognizing patterns and applying appropriate responses]] in domains such as firefighting, chess, and weather forecasting. Evidence of more general debiasing, across domains and different kinds of problems, however, was not discovered until recently. The reason for the lack of more domain-general debiasing was attributed to experts failing to recognize the underlying "deep structure" of problems in different formats and domains. Weather forecasters are able to predict rain with high accuracy, for example, but show the same overconfidence in their answers to basic trivia questions as other people. An exception was graduate training in scientific fields heavily reliant on statistics such as psychology.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching reasoning|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/238/4827/625|journal = Science|date = 1987-10-30|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 3672116|pages = 625–631|volume = 238|issue = 4827|doi = 10.1126/science.3672116|first = R. E.|last = Nisbett|first2 = G. T.|last2 = Fong|first3 = D. R.|last3 = Lehman|first4 = P. W.|last4 = Cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments by Morewedge and colleagues (2015) have found interactive computer games and instructional videos can result in long-term debiasing at a general level. In a series of experiments, training with interactive computer games that provided players with personalized feedback, mitigating strategies, and practice, reduced six cognitive biases by more than 30% immediately and by more than 20% as long as three months later. The biased reduced were anchoring, bias blind spot, confirmation bias, fundamental attribution error, projection bias, and representativeness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Training in [[reference class forecasting]] may also improve outcomes. Reference class forecasting is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] calls the [[outside view]]. As pointed out by Kahneman in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] (p. 252), one of the reasons reference class forecasting is effective for debasing is that, in contrast to conventional forecasting methods, it takes into account the so-called "[[unknown unknowns]]." According to Kahneman, reference class forecasting is effective for debiasing and "has come a long way" in practical implementation since he originally proposed the idea with Amos Tversky (p. 251).

== Sometimes effective strategies ==

=== Incentives ===
* Paying people for optimal behavior through bonuses or by providing discounts (e.g., to exercise, to take their medication, to trade in fuel inefficient vehicles such as the "[[Car Allowance Rebate System|cash for clunkers]]" program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of accuracy motivation on anchoring and adjustment: Do people adjust from provided anchors?|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0021540|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 917–932|volume = 99|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/a0021540|first = Joseph P.|last = Simmons|first2 = Robyn A.|last2 = LeBoeuf|first3 = Leif D.|last3 = Nelson|pmid=21114351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxing people for suboptimal behavior (e.g., drinking soda, smoking tobacco, and weed).

=== Nudges ===
* Using [[default effect]] to [[nudge theory|nudge people]] towards decisions optimal for the decision maker or society.
* [[Commitment device]]s that makes it more costly to make suboptimal decisions (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2014&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;). 
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Reframing]] choice options in ways that make important attributes salient. Labeling hamburger meat 25% fat, for example, makes people more sensitive to fat content than labeling it 75% lean. 
* Presenting information in formats that make critical information easier to evaluate, such as displaying nutritional value using a "traffic light" system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Training ===
* Providing people with personalized feedback regarding the direction and degree to which they exhibit bias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Teaching a "consider-the-alternative" strategy, such as considering a plausible alternative reason for an event than cause one suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=Edward R.|last2=Markman|first2=Keith D.|title=Multiple explanation: A consider-an-alternative strategy for debiasing judgments.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1069–1086|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching people statistical reasoning and normative rules of which they are unaware.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Encouraging people to take the perspective of a person who will experience the consequences of their decision can reduce bias. Participants who were shown a "morphed" image of their face to resemble themselves upon retirement were more likely to save money for the future rather than elect to receive it in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Increasing Saving Behavior Through Age-Progressed Renderings of the Future Self|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S23|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = 2011-11-01|issn = 0022-2437|pmc = 3949005|pmid = 24634544|pages = S23-S37|volume = 48|issue = SPL|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S23|first = Hal E|last = Hershfield|first2 = Daniel G|last2 = Goldstein|first3 = William F|last3 = Sharpe|first4 = Jesse|last4 = Fox|first5 = Leo|last5 = Yeykelis|first6 = Laura L|last6 = Carstensen|first7 = Jeremy N|last7 = Bailenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage, incentivize, or make mandatory the use of [[reference class forecasting]]. [[Reference class forecasting]] was made mandatory in Great Britain and Denmark for large government infrastructure projects with the explicit purpose of eliminating [[optimism bias]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78638">In [[mathematics]], '''differential forms on a Riemann surface''' are an important special case of the general theory of [[differential forms]] on [[smooth manifold]]s, distinguished by the fact that the [[conformal structure]]  on the [[Riemann surface]] intrinsically defines a [[Hodge star operator]] on 1-forms (or differentials) without specifying a [[Riemannian metric]]. This allows the use of [[Hilbert space]] techniques for studying function theory on the Riemann surface and in particular for the construction of harmonic and holomorphic differentials with prescribed singularities. These methods were first used by {{harvtxt|Hilbert|1909}} in his variational approach to the Dirichlet principle, making rigorous the arguments proposed by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Later {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}} found a direct approach using his method of orthogonal projection, a precursor of the modern theory of [[elliptic differential operator]]s and [[Sobolev space]]s. These techniques were originally applied to prove the [[uniformization theorem]] and its generalization to [[planar Riemann surface]]s. Later they supplied the analytic foundations for the [[Hodge theory|harmonic integrals]] of {{harvtxt|Hodge|1940}}. This article covers general results on differential forms on a Riemann surface that do not rely on any choice of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]].

==Hodge star on 1-forms==
On a Riemann surface the [[Hodge star]] is defined on 1-forms by the local formula

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ \star(p\,dx + q\, dy) =  -q\,dx + p\, dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is well-defined because it is invariant under [[holomorphic]] changes of coordinate.

Indeed, if {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is holomorphic as a function of {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''iv''}},
then by the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''y''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; = –''x''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In the new coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{p\,dx + q\, dy = (px_u + q y_u)du + (px_v+qy_v)dv=p_1 du + q_1 dv,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{-q_1 \,du + p_1 \,dv= -(px_v+qy_v)du + (px_u + q y_u)dv = -q(x_u du + x_v dv) + p(y_u du + y_vdv) = -q\,dx + p\, dy,}&lt;/math&gt;

proving the claimed invariance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that for 1-forms {{nowrap|1=''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx'' + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''dy''}} and {{nowrap|1=''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx'' + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''dy''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\omega_1 \wedge \star \omega_2 = (p_1p_2 + q_1q_2)\, dx\wedge dy =  \omega_2 \wedge \star \omega_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular if {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\omega \wedge \star \omega =(p^2+q^2) \, dx\wedge dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in standard coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \star dz = -i dz,\,\, \star d\overline{z} = i d\overline{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling that

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial\over \partial z} = {1\over 2}\left({\partial \over \partial x} - i {\partial \over \partial y}\right),\,\,\, {\partial \over\partial \overline{z}} =
{1\over 2} \left({\partial \over\partial x} +i {\partial \over\partial y}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; df= f_z \, dz + f_{\overline{z}}\, d\overline{z} = \partial f + \bar{\partial}f.&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition &lt;math&gt;d = \partial  + \bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the choice of local coordinate. The 1-forms with only a &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; component are called (1,0) forms; those with only a &lt;math&gt;d\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt; component are called (0,1) forms. The operators &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\partial}&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[Complex differential form#Dolbeault operators|Dolbeault operators]].

It follows that
 
:&lt;math&gt; \star df=  -i\partial f + i\bar{\partial}f.&lt;/math&gt;

The Dolbeault operators can similarly be defined on 1-forms and as zero on 2-forms. They have the properties

:&lt;math&gt;d=\partial+\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2=\bar{\partial}^2=\partial\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\partial=0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Poincaré lemma==
On a Riemann surface the [[Poincaré lemma]] states that every closed 1-form or 2-form is locally exact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011|pages=443–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if ''ω'' is a smooth 1-form with {{nowrap|1=''dω'' = 0}} then in some open neighbourhood of a given point there is a smooth function ''f'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} in that neighbourhood; and for any smooth 2-form Ω there is a smooth 1-form ''ω'' defined in some open neighbourhood of a given point such that {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''dω''}} in that neighbourhood.
 
If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} is a closed 1-form on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} then {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''}}.  Then {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' − ''g''}} must satisfy {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q'' − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The right hand side here is independent of ''x'' since its partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is 0. So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h(x,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds - g(a,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds,}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt + \int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''r'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}} then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''d''(''f'' ''dx'' + ''g'' ''dy'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}}. Thus a solution is given by {{nowrap|1=''f'' = 0}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x r(t,y) \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Comment on differential forms with compact support.''' Note that if ''ω'' has compact support, so vanishes outside some smaller rectangle {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;''b''}} and {{nowrap|''c'' &lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''}}, then the same is true for the solution ''f''(''x'',''y''). So the Poincaré lemma for 1-forms holds with this additional conditions of compact support.

A similar statement is true or 2-forms; but, since there is some choices for the solution, a little more care has to be taken in making those choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|2011|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact if Ω has compact support on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}} and if furthermore {{nowrap|1=∬ Ω = 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''dω''}} with ''ω'' a 1-form of compact support on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}}. Indeed, Ω must have support in some smaller rectangle {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;''b''}} and {{nowrap|''c'' &lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''}}. So {{nowrap|''r''(''x'', ''y'')}} vanishes for {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''x'' ≥ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and for {{nowrap|''y'' ≤ ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let ''h''(''y'') be a smooth function supported in (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) with {{math|1=∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''h''(''t'') ''dt'' = 1}}. Set {{math|1=''k''(''x'') = ∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''r''(''x'',''y'') ''dy''}}: it is a smooth function supported in  (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence {{nowrap|1=''R''(''x'',''y'') = ''r''(''x'',''y'') − ''k''(''x'')''h''(''y'')}} is smooth and supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. It now satisfies {{math|1=∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''R''(''x'',''y'') ''dy'' ≡ 0}}. Finally set

:&lt;math&gt;P(x,y)=\int_c^y R(x,y) dy,\,\,\, Q(x,y)=h(y)\int_a^x k(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Both ''P'' and ''Q'' are smooth and supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''}} and {{nowrap|1=''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''k''(''x'')''h''(''y'')}}. Hence {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = −''P'' ''dx'' + ''Q'' ''dy''}} is a smooth 1-form supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = (Q_x + P_y)\,dx \wedge dy = r \,dx \wedge dy =\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integration of 2-forms==
If Ω is a continuous 2-form of compact support on a Riemann surface ''X'', its support ''K'' can be covered by finitely many coordinate charts ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and there is a partition of unity χ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of smooth non-negative functions with compact support such that ∑ χ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 on a neighbourhood of ''K''. Then the integral of Ω  is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_X \Omega = \sum \int_{X} \chi_i\Omega= \sum \int_{U_i} \chi_i \Omega,}&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral over ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has its usual definition in local coordinates. The integral is independent of the choices here.

If Ω has the local representation ''f''(''x'',''y'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'', then |Ω| is the density |''f''(''x'',''y'')| ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'', which is well defined and satisfies |∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω| ≤ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|. If Ω is a non-negative continuous density, not necessarily of compact support, its integral is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_X \Omega =\sup_{0\le \psi \le 1,\, \psi\in C_c(X)} \int_X \psi \Omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

If Ω is any continuous 2-form it is integrable if  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω| &lt; ∞. In this case, if ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  |Ω| = lim ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|, then ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω can be defined as lim ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω. The integrable continuous 2-forms form a complex normed space with norm ||Ω||&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|.

==Integration of 1-forms along paths==
If ''ω'' is a 1-form on a Riemann surface ''X'' and ''γ''(''t'') for {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}} is a smooth path in ''X'', then the mapping ''γ'' induces a 1-form ''γ''∗''ω'' on [''a'',''b'']. The integral of ''ω'' along ''γ'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = \int_a^b \gamma^{*} \omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition extends to piecewise smooth paths ''γ'' by dividing the path up into the finitely many segments on which it is smooth. In local coordinates if {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} and {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''),''y''(''t''))}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\gamma^* \omega= p(\gamma(t)) \dot{x}(t) \, dt + q(\gamma(t))\dot{y}(t)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega= \int_a^b p(\gamma(t)) \dot{x}(t) \, dt + q(\gamma(t))\dot{y}(t)\, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if the 1-form ''ω'' is exact on some connected open set ''U'', so that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} for some smooth function ''f'' on ''U'' (unique up to a constant), and ''γ''(''t''), {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}}, is a smooth path in ''U'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega =\int_a^b d(f(\gamma(t)) = f(\gamma(b)) - f(\gamma(a)).}&lt;/math&gt;

This depends only on the difference of the values of ''f'' at the endpoints of the curve, so is independent of the choice of ''f''. By the Poincaré lemma, every closed 1-form is locally exact, so this allows ∫&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; ω to be computed as a sum of differences of this kind and for the integral of closed 1-forms to be extended to continuous paths:

'''Monodromy theorem.''' If ''ω'' is a closed 1-form, the integral {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}} can be extended to any continuous path ''γ''(''t''), {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ t ≤ ''b''}} so that it is invariant under any [[homotopy]] of paths keeping the end points fixed.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=151–158}}
*{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=272–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
::In fact, the image of ''γ'' is compact, so can be covered by finitely many connected open sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on each of which ω can be written ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some smooth function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, unique up to a constant.&lt;ref&gt;It is not assumed that if two ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s intersect then their intersection is connected, as is the case for disks in the plane. Note, however, that if the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; were chosen to be small geodesic disks for a conformal Riemannian metric, locally of the form {{nowrap|1=''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''(''z'') {{abs|''dz''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then any non-empty intersection of finitely many ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; would be [[geodesically convex]] and hence connected; see {{harvnb|do Carmo|1976|pages=303–305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be assumed that [''a'',''b''] is broken up into finitely many closed intervals {{nowrap|1=''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = [''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} with {{nowrap|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''}} so that {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊂ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. From the above if ''γ'' is piecewise smooth,

:::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = \sum \int_{\gamma|_{K_i}} \omega= \sum \int_{K_i} d(f_i\circ \gamma) =\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(\gamma(t_i)) - f_i(\gamma(t_{i-1}))=
f_n(\gamma(b)) - f_1(\gamma(b)) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [f_i(\gamma(t_i)) - f_{i+1}(\gamma(t_i))].}&lt;/math&gt;

::Now ''γ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in the open set {{nowrap|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, hence in a connected open component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The difference {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=''dg''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, so is a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; independent of ''γ''. Hence

:::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = f_n(\gamma(b)) - f_1(\gamma(a)) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} c_i.}&lt;/math&gt;

::The formula on the right hand side also makes sense if ''γ'' is just continuous on [''a'',''b''] and can be used to define {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The definition is independent of choices: for the curve ''γ'' can be uniformly approximated by piecewise smooth curves ''δ'' so close that {{nowrap|''δ''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊂ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all ''i''; the formula above then equals {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}} and shows the integral is independent of the choice of ''δ''. The same argument shows that the definition is also invariant under small homotopies fixing endpoints; by compactness, it is therefore invariant under any homotopy fixing endpoints.

The same argument shows that a homotopy between closed continuous loops does not change their integrals over closed 1-forms. Since {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' = ''f''(''γ''(''b'')) − ''f''(''γ''(''a''))}}, the integral of an exact form over a closed loop vanishes. 
Conversely if the integral of a closed 1-form ''ω'' over any closed loop vanishes, then the 1-form must be exact.

::Indeed a function ''f''(''z'') can be defined on ''X'' by fixing a point ''w'', taking any path ''δ'' from ''w'' to ''z'' and setting {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The assumption implies that ''f'' is independent of the path. To check that {{nowrap|1=''df'' = ''ω''}}, it suffices to check this locally. Fix ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and take a path ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from ''w'' to ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the Poincaré lemma implies that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''dg''}} for some smooth function ''g'' defined in a neighbourhood of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a path from ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''z'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' + ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' + ''g''(''z'') − ''g''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, so ''f'' differs from ''g'' by a constant near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence {{nowrap|1=''df'' = ''dg'' = ''ω''}} near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

A closed 1-form is exact if and only if its integral around any piecewise smooth or continuous Jordan curve vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In fact the integral is already known to vanish for an exact form, so it suffices to show that if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = 0}} for all piecewise smooth closed Jordan curves ''γ'' then {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = 0}} for all closed continuous curves ''γ''. Let ''γ'' be a closed continuous curve. The image of ''γ'' can be covered by finitely many opens on which ''ω'' is exact and this data can be used to define the integral on ''γ''. Now recursively replace ''γ'' by smooth segments between successive division points on the curve so that the resulting curve ''δ'' has only finitely many intersection points and passes through each of these only twice. This curve can be broken up as a superposition of finitely many piecewise smooth Jordan curves. The integral over each of these is zero, so their sum, the integral over ''δ'', is also zero. By construction the integral over ''δ'' equals the integral over ''γ'', which therefore vanishes.

The above argument also shows that given a continuous Jordan curve ''γ''(''t''), there is a finite set of simple smooth Jordan curves ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') with nowhere zero derivatives such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma \omega = \sum_i \int_{\gamma_i} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

for any closed 1-form ''ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus to check exactness of a closed form it suffices to show that the vanishing of the integral around any  regular closed curve, i.e. a simple smooth Jordan curve with nowhere vanishing derivative.

The same methods show that any continuous loop on a Riemann surface is homotopic to a smooth loop with nowhere zero derivative.

==Green–Stokes formula==
{{see also|Green's theorem|Stokes' theorem}}
If ''U'' is a bounded region in the complex plane with boundary consisting of piecewise smooth curves and ''ω'' is a 1-form defined on a neighbourhood of the closure of ''U'', then the [[Green's theorem|Green–Stokes formula]] states that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial U} \omega = \int_U d\omega .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular if ''ω'' is a 1-form of compact support on '''C''' then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\bf C} d\omega = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

since the formula may be applied to a large disk containing the support of ω.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=251–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar formulas hold on a Riemann surface ''X'' and can be deduced from the classical formulas using [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Weyl|1955|pages=72–78}}
*{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=158–163}}
*{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=284–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if {{nowrap|''U'' ⊂ ''X''}} is a connected region with compact closure and piecewise smooth boundary ∂''U'' and ''ω'' is a 1-form defined on a neighbourhood of the closure of ''U'', then the '''Green–Stokes formula''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_{\partial U} \omega = \int_U d\omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''ω'' is a 1-form of compact support on ''X'' then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X} d\omega = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

To prove the second formula take a partition of unity ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; supported in coordinate charts covering the support of ''ω''. Then {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dω'' = ∑ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'') = 0}}, by the planar result. Similarly to prove the first formula it suffices to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_{\partial U} \psi\omega = \int_U d(\psi\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

when ''ψ'' is a smooth function compactly supported in some coordinate patch. If the coordinate patch avoids the boundary curves, both sides vanish by the second formula above. Otherwise it can be assumed that the coordinate patch is a disk, the boundary of which cuts the curve transversely at two points. The same will be true for a slightly smaller disk containing the support of ''ψ''. Completing the curve to a Jordan curve by adding part of the boundary of the smaller disk, the formula reduces to the planar Green-Stokes formula.

The Green–Stokes formula implies an adjoint relation for the Laplacian on functions defined as Δ''f'' = −''d''∗''df''. This gives a 2-form, given in local coordinates by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f =\left( -{\partial^2 f \over \partial x^2} - {\partial^2 f \over \partial y^2}\right) \, dx \wedge dy .&lt;/math&gt;

Then if ''f'' and ''g'' are smooth and the closure of ''U'' is compact

:&lt;math&gt;\int_U f\Delta g - g \Delta f = \int_{\partial U} g {\star d f} - f{\star d g} .&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''f'' or ''g'' has compact support then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f \Delta g = \int_X g \Delta f .&lt;/math&gt;

== Duality between 1-forms and closed curves ==
'''Theorem.''' If  ''γ'' is a continuous Jordan curve on a Riemann surface ''X'', there is a smooth closed 1-form ''α'' of compact support such that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α''}} for any closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::It suffices to prove this when ''γ'' is a regular closed curve. By the [[inverse function theorem]], there is a [[tubular neighborhood|tubular neighbourhood]] of the image of ''γ'', i.e. a smooth diffeomorphism {{math|Γ(''t'', ''s'')}} of the annulus {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × (−1,1)}} into ''X'' such that {{math|1=Γ(''t'',0) = ''γ''(''t'')}}. Using a bump function on the second factor, a non-negative function ''g'' with compact support can be constructed such that ''g'' is smooth off ''γ'', has support in a small neighbourhood of ''γ'', and in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of ''γ'' is equal to 0 for {{nowrap|''s'' &lt; 0}} and 1 for {{nowrap|''s'' ≥ 0}}. Thus ''g'' has a jump discontinuity across ''γ'', although its differential ''dg'' is smooth with compact support. But then, setting {{nowrap|1=''α'' = −''dg''}}, it follows from Green's formula applied to the annulus {{math|''γ'' × [0,''ε'']}} that

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_X \omega \wedge \alpha = \int_X dg \wedge \omega =  \int_{\gamma\times (0,\varepsilon)} dg \wedge \omega = \int_{\gamma\times (0,\varepsilon)}d(g\omega) = \int_\gamma \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary 1.''' A closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' is exact if and only if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = 0}} for all smooth 1-forms ''α'' of compact support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In fact if ''ω'' is exact, it has the form ''df'' for ''f'' smooth, so that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ''α'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''f'' ''α'') = 0}} by Green's theorem. Conversely, if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = 0}} for all smooth 1-forms ''α'' of compact support, the duality between Jordan curves and 1-forms implies that the integral of ''ω'' around any closed Jordan curve is zero and hence that ''ω'' is exact.

'''Corollary 2.''' If ''γ'' is a continuous closed curve on a Riemann surface ''X'', there is a smooth closed 1-form ''α'' of compact support such that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α''}} for any closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' on ''X''. The form ''α'' is unique up to adding an exact form and can be taken to have support in any open neighbourhood of the image of ''γ''.

::In fact ''γ'' is homotopic to a piecewise smooth closed curve ''δ'', so that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. On the other hand there are finitely many piecewise smooth Jordan curves ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that {{math|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∑ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The result for ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; thus implies the result for ''γ''. If ''β'' is another form with the same property, the difference {{nowrap|''α'' − ''β''}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ (''α'' − ''β'') = 0}} for all closed smooth 1-forms ''ω''. So the difference is exact by Corollary 1. Finally, if ''U'' is any neighbourhood of the image of ''γ'', then the last result follows by applying first assertion to ''γ'' and ''U'' in place of ''γ'' and ''X''.

==Intersection number of closed curves==
The '''[[intersection number]]''' of two closed curves γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a Riemann surface ''X'' can be defined analytically by the formula&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Weyl|1955|pages=79–92}}
*{{harvnb|Farkas|Kra|1992|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Note that more generally intersection theory has also been developed separately within [[differential topology]] using [[Sard's theorem]]. See for example:
*{{harvnb|Guillemin|Pollack|1974|pages=94−116}}
*{{harvnb|Shastri|2011|pages=177−181}}
*{{harvnb|Hirsch|1997|pages=131−138}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I(\gamma_1 , \gamma_2) = \int_X \alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2,&lt;/math&gt;

where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are smooth 1-forms of compact support corresponding to γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From the definition it follows that {{math|1=''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = − ''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Since α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be taken to have its support in a neighbourhood of the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that {{math|1=''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0}} if γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are disjoint. By definition it depends only on the homotopy classes of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More generally the intersection number is always an integer and counts the number of times ''with signs'' that the two curves intersect. A crossing at a point is a positive or negative crossing according to whether ''d''γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''d''γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the same or opposite sign to {{math|1=''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' = −i/2 ''dz'' ∧ ''d''{{overline|''z''}}}}, for a local holomorphic parameter ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''.&lt;ref&gt;This makes sense if the tangent vectors to the two curves at the crossing point exist, are non-vanishing and are transverse there, i.e. are not proportional.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Indeed, by homotopy invariance, it suffices to check this for smooth Jordan curves with nowhere vanishing derivatives. The α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined by taking α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''df'' with ''f'' of compact support in a neighbourhood of the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equal to 0 near the left hand side of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 near the right hand side of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and smooth off the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then if the points of intersection of γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') with γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; occur at ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:::&lt;math&gt;I(\gamma_1,\gamma_2) = \int_{\gamma_2} \alpha_1 = \int_{\gamma_2} df = \sum f\circ \gamma_2(t_i+) - f\circ\gamma_2(t_i-).&lt;/math&gt;

::This gives the required result since the jump {{math|1=''f''∘γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;+) − ''f''∘γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;−)}} is + 1 for a positive crossing and −1 for a negative crossing.

==Holomorphic and harmonic 1-forms==
A '''holomorphic 1-form''' ω is one that in local coordinates is given by an expression ''f''(''z'') ''dz'' with ''f'' [[holomorphic]]. Since &lt;math&gt;dg=\partial_z g \, dz + \partial_{\overline{z}} g\, d\overline{z},&lt;/math&gt; it follows that ''d''ω = 0, so any holomorphic 1-form is closed. Moreover, since ∗''dz'' = ''i'' ''dz'', ω must satisfy ∗ω = ''i''ω. These two conditions characterize holomorphic 1-forms. For if ω is closed, locally it can be written as ''dg'' for some ''g'', The condition ∗''dg'' = ''i'' ''dg'' forces &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\overline{z}} g = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so that ''g'' is holomorphic and ''dg'' = ''g'' '(''z'') ''dz'', so that ω is holomorphic.

Let ω = ''f'' ''dz'' be a holomorphic 1-form. Write ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; real. Then  ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0  and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0; and since ∗ω = ''i''ω, ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. This process can clearly be reversed, so that there is a one-one correspondence between holomorphic 1-forms and real 1-forms ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Under this correspondence, ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the real part of ω while ω is given by ω= ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Such forms ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''harmonic 1-forms'''. By definition ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic if and only if ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic.

Since holomorphic 1-forms locally have the form ''df'' with ''f'' a holomorphic function and since the real part of a holomorphic function is harmonic, harmonic 1-forms locally have the form ''dh'' with ''h'' a [[harmonic function]]. Conversely if ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be written in this way locally, ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''∗''dh'' = (''h''&lt;sub&gt;''xx''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''yy''&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dx''∧''dy'' so that ''h'' is harmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remark.''' The definition of harmonic functions and 1-forms is intrinsic and only relies on the underlying Riemann surface structure. If, however, a conformal metric is chosen on the Riemann surface ([[Differential forms on a Riemann surface#Conformal netrics|see below]]), the adjoint ''d''* of ''d'' can be defined and the Hodge star operation extended to functions and 2-forms. The Hodge Laplacian can be defined on ''k''-forms as ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''dd''* +''d''*''d'' and then a function ''f'' or a 1-form ω is harmonic if and only if it is annihilated by the Hodge Laplacian, i.e. ∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = 0 or ∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ω = 0. The metric structure, however, is not required for the application to the uniformization of simply connected or planar Riemann surfaces.

==Sobolev spaces on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;==
The theory of Sobolev spaces on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}, an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as {{harvtxt|Warner|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Griffiths|Harris|1994}}. It provides an analytic framework for studying function theory on the torus '''C'''/'''Z'''+''i'' '''Z''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; using [[Fourier series]], which are just eigenfunction expansions for the Laplacian {{math|1=–∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; –∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The theory developed here essentially covers tori '''C''' / Λ where Λ is a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in '''C'''. Although there is a corresponding theory of Sobolev spaces on any compact Riemann surface, it is elementary in this case, because it reduces to [[harmonic analysis]] on the compact Abelian group {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Classical approaches to Weyl's lemma use harmonic analysis on the non-compact Abelian group '''C''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. the methods of [[Fourier analysis]], in particular [[convolution operator]]s and the [[fundamental solution]] of the Laplacian.&lt;ref&gt;For treatments in texts on Riemann surfaces, see:

Let '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt;,''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iy''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''x'', ''y'' ∈ [0,2π)} = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''C'''/Λ where Λ = '''Z''' + ''i'' '''Z'''.
For λ = ''m'' + ''i'' ''n'' ≅ (''m'',''n'') in Λ, set {{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'',''y'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''(''mx'' + ''ny'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Furthermore, set ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;= -''i''∂/∂''x'' and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = -''i''∂/∂''y''. For α = (''p'',''q'') set ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; =(''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;, a differential operator of total degree |α| = ''p'' + ''q''. Thus {{math|1=''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|1=λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; =''m''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The (''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;) form an [[orthonormal basis]] in C('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the inner product {{math|1=(''f'',''g'') = (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;∬ ''f''(''x'',''y'') {{overline|''g''(''x'',''y'')}} ''dx'' ''dy''}}, so that {{math|1=(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∑ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;) = ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|''b''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.

For ''f'' in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''k'' an integer, define the ''k''th Sobolev norm by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|f\|_{(k)} = \left(\sum |\widehat{f}(\lambda)|^2 (1 + |\lambda|^2)^k\right)^{1/2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The associated inner product

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f,g)_{(k)} = \sum \widehat{f}(\lambda)\overline{\widehat{g}(\lambda)} (1 +|\lambda|^2)^k}&lt;/math&gt;

makes C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) into an inner product space. Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) be its Hilbert space completion. It can be described equivalently as the Hilbert space completion of the space of [[trigonometric polynomial]]s—that is finite sums {{math|1=(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}—with respect to the ''k''th Sobolev norm, so that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = {∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; : ∑ |''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ∞} with inner product

:(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∑ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sub&gt; = ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|''b''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}} (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

As explained below, the elements in the intersection ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) =  &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are exactly the smooth functions on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elements in the union ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are just [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (sometimes referred to as "periodic distributions" on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990}}
*{{harvnb|Rudin|1973|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of properties of the Sobolev spaces.

*'''Differentiability and Sobolev spaces.''' {{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for ''k'' ≥ 0 since, using the [[binomial theorem]] to expand (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|f\|_{(k)}^2 = \sum_{|\alpha|\le k} {k\choose \alpha} \|D^\alpha f\|^2  \le C \cdot \sup_{|\alpha|\le k} |D^\alpha f|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;
 
*'''Differential operators.''' ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−|α|&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; defines a bounded linear map from ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−|α|&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  The operator ''I'' + Δ defines a unitary map of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); in particular (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; defines a unitary map of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''k'' ≥ 0. 
::The first assertions follow because ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and |λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;| ≤ |λ|&lt;sup&gt;|α|&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;|α|/2&lt;/sup&gt;. The second assertions follow because ''I'' + Δ acts as multiplication by 1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;.

*'''Duality.''' For ''k'' ≥ 0, the pairing sending ''f'', ''g'' to (''f'',''g'') establishes a duality between ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

::This is a restatement of the fact that (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; establishes a unitary map between these two spaces, because {{math|1=(''f'',''g'') = ((''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''f'',''g'')&lt;sub&gt;(−''k'')&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

*'''Multiplication operators.''' If ''h'' is a smooth function then multiplication by ''h'' defines a continuous operator on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

::For ''k'' ≥ 0, this follows from the formula for ||''f''||{{su|p=2|b=(''k'')}} above and the [[product rule|Leibniz rule]]. Continuity for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) follows by duality, since {{math|1=(''f'',''hg'') = ({{overline|''h''}}''f'',''g'')}}.

*'''Sobolev spaces and differentiability (Sobolev's embedding theorem).''' For ''k'' ≥ 0, {{math|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and sup&lt;sub&gt;|α|≤''k''&lt;/sub&gt; |''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''|  ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;(''k''+2)&lt;/sub&gt;.

::The inequalities for trigonometric polynomials imply the containments. The inequality for ''k'' = 0 follows from

= \left(\sum (1+|\lambda|^2)^{-2}\right)^{1/2} \cdot \|\sum a_\lambda e_\lambda\|_{(2)},}&lt;/math&gt;

::by the [[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality]]. The first term is finite by the [[integral test]], since ∬&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; (1 + |''z''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx'' ''dy'' = {{math|1=2π ∫{{su|p=∞|b=0}} (1 + ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ''r'' ''dr''}} &lt; ∞ using [[polar coordinates]]. In general if |α| ≤ k, then |sup ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''| ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ||''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''||&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt; by the continuity properties of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;.

*'''Smooth functions.''' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) consists of Fourier series ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all ''k'' &gt; 0, (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; |''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;| tends to 0 as |λ| tends to ∞, i.e. the Fourier coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; are of "rapid decay".

::This is an immediate consequence of the Sobolev embedding theorem.

*'''Inclusion maps (Rellich's compactness theorem).''' If ''k'' &gt; ''j'', the space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a subspace of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the inclusion ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is [[compact operator|compact]].

::With respect to the natural orthonormal bases, the inclusion map becomes multiplication by (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−(''k''−''j'')/2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is therefore compact because it is given by a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries tending to zero.

*'''Elliptic regularity (Weyl's lemma).''' Suppose that ''f'' and ''u'' in  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) satisfy ∆''u'' = ''f''. Suppose also that ψ ''f'' is a smooth function for every smooth function ψ vanishing off a fixed open set ''U'' in '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; then the same is true for ''u''. (Thus if ''f'' is smooth off ''U'', so is ''u''.)

::By the Leibniz rule {{math|1=Δ(ψ''u'') = (Δψ) ''u'' + 2(ψ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) + ψ Δ''u''}}, so {{math|1=ψ''u'' = (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[ψ''u'' + (Δψ) ''u'' + 2(ψ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) + ψ''f'']}}. If it is known that φ''u'' lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for some ''k'' and all φ vanishing off ''U'', then differentiating shows that φ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;  and φ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The square-bracketed expression therefore also lies in  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The operator (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; carries this space onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so that ψ''u'' must lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Continuing in this way, it follows that ψ''u'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

*'''Hodge decomposition on functions.'''

*'''Hodge theory on T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.''' Let Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) be the space of smooth ''k''-forms for 0 ≤ ''k'' ≤ 2.

The Hodge star operation is defined on 1-forms by ∗(''p'' dx + ''q'' ''dy'') = −''q'' ''dx'' + ''p'' ''dy''. This definition is extended to 0-forms and 2-forms by *''f'' = ''f'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' and *(''g'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'') = ''g''. Thus ** = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on ''k''-forms. There is a natural complex inner product on Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) defined by

:Define {{math|1=δ = −∗''d''∗}}.

Indeed by the Green-Stokes formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1983|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(d\alpha,\beta) = \int d\alpha \wedge \star \overline{\beta} = \int d\alpha \wedge \star \overline{\beta} -\int d(\alpha\wedge \star\overline{\beta}) = (-1)^{\partial\alpha} \int \alpha\wedge d\star\overline{\beta} = \int\alpha \wedge \star\overline{\delta\beta} = (\alpha,\delta\beta).}&lt;/math&gt;

:The operators ''d'' and δ = ''d''* satisfy ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

Moreover {{math|1=∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'' ''dx''+ ''q'' ''dy'') =(∆''p'')''dx'' + (∆''q'')''dy''}} and {{math|1=∆&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'' ''dx''∧''dy'') = (∆''f'')''dx''∧''dy''}}. This allows the Hodge decomposition to be generalised to include 1-forms and 2-forms:

*'''Hodge theorem.''' Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''∗ &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ∗''d''  = ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''* &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d''*. In the Hilbert space completion of  Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the orthogonal complement of {{math|1=im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ∗''d''  }} is {{math|1=ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''∗}}, the finite-dimensional space of harmonic ''k''-forms, i.e. the constant ''k''-forms. In particular in  {{math|1=Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} ,  {{math|1=ker ''d'' / im ''d'' =  ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''*}}, the space of harmonic ''k''-forms. Thus the [[de Rham cohomology]] of '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is given by harmonic (i.e. constant) ''k''-forms.

::From the Hodge decomposition on functions, Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ker ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Moreover im (''dd''* + ''d''*''d'') ⊊ im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d''*. Since  ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''* is orthogonal to this direct sum, it follows that Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''* &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d''*. The last assertion follows because ker ''d'' contains {{math|1=ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''* &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d''}} and is orthogonal to im ''d''* = im ∗''d''.

==Hilbert space of 1-forms==
In the case of the compact Riemann surface '''C''' / Λ, the theory of Sobolev spaces shows that the Hilbert space completion of smooth 1-forms can be decomposed as the sum of three pairwise orthogonal spaces, the closure of exact 1-forms ''df'', the closure of coexact 1-forms ∗''df'' and the harmonic 1-forms (the 2-dimensional space of constant 1-forms). The '''method of orthogonal projection''' of {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}}  put Riemann's approach to the Dirichlet principle on sound footing by generalizing this composition to arbitrary Riemann surfaces.

If ''X'' is a Riemann surface Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X'') denote the space of continuous 1-forms with compact support. It admits the complex inner product

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(\alpha,\beta) = \int_{X} \alpha \wedge \star\overline{\beta},}&lt;/math&gt;

for α and β in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Let ''H'' denote the Hilbert space completion of Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Although ''H'' can be interpreted in terms of measurable functions, like Sobolev spaces on tori it can be studied directly using only elementary [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] techniques involving Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators.

Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closure of ''d'' ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''X'') and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closure of ∗''d'' ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''X''). Since {{math|1=(''df'',∗''dg'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ''d''{{overline|''g''}} = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d'' (''f'' ''d''{{overline|''g''}}) = 0}}, these are orthogonal subspaces. Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denote the orthogonal complement
(''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = ''H''{{su|b=1|p=⊥}} &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''{{su|b=2|p=⊥}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=178–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem (Hodge−Weyl decomposition).''' ''H'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subspace ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of square integrable harmonic 1-forms on ''X'', i.e. 1-forms ω such that ''d''ω = 0, ''d''∗ω = 0 and ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ω ∧ ∗{{overline|ω}} &lt; ∞.

*Every square integrable continuous 1-form lies in ''H''.

::The space of continuous 1-forms of compact support is contained in the space of square integrable continuous 1-forms. They are both inner product spaces for the above inner product. So it suffices to show that any square integrable continuous 1-form can be approximated by continuous 1-forms of compact support. Let ω be a continuous square integrable 1-form, Thus the positive density Ω = ω ∧ ∗{{overline|ω}} is integrable and there are continuous functions of compact support ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with 0 ≤  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 such that ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω tends to ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω = ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Let {{math|1=φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − (1 − ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, a continuous function of compact support with {{math|1=0 ≤ φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1}}. Then ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω tends to ω in ''H'', since ||ω − ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; (1 − ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) Ω tends to 0.

*If ω in ''H'' is such that ψ ⋅ ω is continuous for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), then  ω is a square integrable continuous 1-form.

::Note that the multiplication operator ''m''(φ) given by ''m''(φ)α = φ ⋅ α for φ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') and α in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X'') satisfies ||''m''(φ)α|| ≤ ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ||α||, where ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; = sup |φ|. Thus ''m''(φ) defines a bounded linear operator with operator norm ||''m''(φ)|| ≤ ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It extends continuously to a bounded linear operator on ''H'' with the same operator norm. For every open set ''U'' with compact closure, there is a continuous function φ of compact support with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1 with φ ≅ 1 on ''U''. Then φ ⋅ ω is continuous on ''U'' so defines a unique continuous form ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U''. If ''V'' is another open set intersecting ''U'', then  ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'': in fact if ''z'' lies in ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'' and  ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'') ⊂ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with  ψ = 1 near ''z'', then ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ ⋅ ω = ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; near ''z''. Thus the  ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;'s patch together to give a continuous 1-form ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X''. By construction,  ψ ⋅ ω = ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). In particular for φ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with {{math|1=0 ≤ φ ≤ 1}}, ∫  φ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = ||φ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ||φ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. So ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is integrable and hence ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is square integrable, so an element of ''H''. On the other hand ω can be approximated by ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Take ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with 0 ≤ ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 with {{math|1=ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since real-valued continuous functions are closed under [[lattice (order)|lattice operation]]s. it can further be assumed that ∫ ψ{{su|b=''n''|p=2}} ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and hence  ∫ ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, increase to ||ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But then ||ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω − ω|| and ||ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|| tend to 0. Since {{math|1=ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this shows that {{math|1=ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. 
 
*Every square integrable harmonic 1-form ω lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

::This is immediate because ω lies in ''H'' and, for ''f'' a smooth function of compact support, {{math|1=(''df'',ω) = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ∗ω  = −∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' ''d''∗ω = 0}} and {{math|1=(∗''df'',ω) = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ω = − ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' ''d''ω = 0}}.

*Every element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a square integrable harmonic 1-form.

::Let ω be an element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and for fixed ''p'' in ''X'' fix a chart ''U'' in ''X'' containing ''p'' which is conformally equivalent by a map ''f'' to a disc ''D'' ⊂ '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''f''(0) = ''p''.  The identification map from  Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''U'') onto Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''D'') and hence into Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) preserves norms (up to a constant factor). Let ''K'' be the closure of  Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''U'') in ''H''. Then the above map extends uniquely to an isometry ''T'' of ''K'' into ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''dx'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''dy''. Moreover if ψ is in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''U'') then {{math|1=''T'' ''m''(ψ) = ''m''(ψ ∘ ''f'') ''T''}}. The identification map ''T'' is also compatible with ''d'' and the Hodge star operator. Let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be a smaller concentric disk in '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and set ''V'' = ''f''(''V'').  Take φ in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''U'') with φ ≡ 1 on ''V''. Then (''m''(φ) ω,''dh'') = 0 = (''m''( φ) ω,∗''dh'') for ''h'' in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''V''). Hence, if  ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''(φ)ω and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''(ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then (ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''dg'') = 0 = (ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''dg'') for ''g'' in {{math|1=''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

::Write ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' ''dx'' + ''b'' ''dy'' with ''a'' and ''b'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The conditions above imply (''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''g'') = 0 = (''d''∗ ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''g''). Replacing ∗''g'' by ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with ω&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a smooth 1-form supported in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0 on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus ∆''a'' = 0 = ∆''b'' on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence by Weyl's lemma, ''a'' and ''b'' are harmonic on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular both of them, and hence ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are smooth on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Transporting these equations back to ''X'', it follows that ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is smooth on ''V'' and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on ''V''. Since ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''(φ)ω  and ''p'' was an arbitrary point, this implies in particular that ''m''(ψ)ω is continuous for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). So ω is continuous and square integrable.

::But then ω is smooth on ''V'' and ''d''ω = 0 = ''d''∗ω on ''V''. Again since ''p'' was arbitrary, this implies ω is smooth on ''X'' and ''d''ω = 0 = ''d''∗ω on ''X'', so that ω is a harmonic 1-form on ''X''.

From the formulas for the Dolbeault operators &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{d C^\infty_c(X) \oplus * d C^\infty_c(X) = \partial C^\infty_c(X) \oplus  \overline{\partial}C^\infty_c(X),}&lt;/math&gt;

where both sums are orthogonal. The two subspaces in the second sum correspond to the ±''i'' eigenspaces of the Hodge ∗ operator. Denoting their closures by ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and that these subspaces are interchanged by complex conjugation. The smooth 1-forms in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have a simple description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ''df'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ∗''df'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''f'' for ''f'' smooth.

::In fact, in view of the decompositions of ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} and its invariance under the Hodge star operation, it suffices to prove the first of these assertions. Since  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  is invariant under complex conjugation, it may be assumed that α is a smooth real 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It is therefore a limit in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of forms ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; smooth of compact support. The 1-form α must be closed since, for any  real-valued ''f'' in ''C''{{su|b=c|p=∞}}(''X''),

:::&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \, d\alpha = -\int_X df \wedge \alpha=  (\alpha,*df)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

::so that ''d''α = 0. To prove that α is exact it suffices to prove that ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; α ∧ ∗β = 0 for any smooth closed real 1-form β of compact support. But by Green's formula

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_X \alpha \wedge \star \beta = (\alpha,\beta) = \lim (df_n,\beta)= \lim \int_X df_n \wedge \beta=\lim \int_X d(f_n\beta)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
The above characterisations have an immediate corollary:

*A smooth 1-form α in ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} can be decomposed uniquely as α = ''da'' + ∗''db'' = &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' + &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''g'', with ''a'', ''b'', ''f'' and ''g'' smooth and all the summands square integrable.

Combined with the previous Hodge–Weyl decomposition and the fact that an element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is automatically smooth, this immediately implies:

'''Theorem (smooth Hodge–Weyl decomposition).''' If α is a smooth square integrable 1-form then α can be written uniquely as {{math|1=α = ω + ''da'' + *''db'' = ω +  &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' + &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''g''}} with  ω harmonic, square integrable and {{math|1=''a'', ''b'', ''f'', ''g''}} smooth with square integrable differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=195–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holomorphic 1-forms with a double pole==
The following result—reinterpreted in the next section in terms of harmonic functions and the Dirichlet principle—is the key tool for proving the [[uniformization theorem]] for simply connected, or more generally planar, Riemann surfaces.

'''Theorem.''' If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique holomorphic differential 1-form ω with a double pole at ''P'', so that the singular part of  ω  is ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' near ''P'',  and regular everywhere else, such that ω is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P'' and the real part of ω is exact on ''X'' \ {P}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The double pole condition is invariant under holomorphic coordinate change ''z'' &lt;math&gt;\mapsto&lt;/math&gt; ''z'' + ''az''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅. There is an analogous result for poles of order greater than 2 where the singular part of ω  has the form ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' with ''k'' &gt; 2, although this condition is not invariant under holomorphic coordinate change.

::To prove uniqueness, note that if ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and  ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two solutions then their difference ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  is a square integrable holomorphic 1-form which is exact on ''X'' \ {P}. Thus near ''P'',  {{math|1=ω = ''f''(''z'') ''dz''}} with ''f'' holomorphic near ''z'' = 0. There is a holomorphic function ''g'' on  ''X'' \ {P} such that ω = ''dg'' there. But then ''g'' must coincide with a [[primitive function|primitive]] of ''f'' near ''z'' = 0, so that ω = ''dg'' everywhere. But then ω lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0), i.e. ω = 0.

::To prove existence, take a bump function 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1 in ''C''{{su|b=c|p=∞}}(''X'') with support in a neighbourhood of ''P'' of the form |''z''| &lt; ε and such that ψ ≡ 1 near ''P'' . Set

:::&lt;math&gt;\alpha =-d \left({\psi(z)\over z}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

::so that α equals ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' near ''P'', vanishes off a neighbourhood of ''P'' and is exact on ''X'' \ {P}. Let β = α − ''i''∗α, a smooth (0,1) form on ''X'', vanishing near ''z'' =0, since it is a (1,0) form there, and vanishing off a larger neighbourhood of ''P''.  By the smooth Hodge−Weyl decomposition, β can be decomposed as  β  =   ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''da'' –  ''i''∗''da'' with ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; a harmonic and square integrable (0,1) form and ''a'' smooth with square integrable differential. Now set γ = α –  ''da'' = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗α − ''i''∗''da'' and ω = Re γ + ''i''∗ Re γ. Then α is exact on ''X'' \ {P}; hence so is γ, as well as its real part, which is also the real part of ω. Near ''P'', the 1-form ω differs from ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' by a smooth (1,0) form. It remains to prove that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;ω = 0 on ''X'' \ {P}; or equivalently that Re γ is harmonic on ''X'' \ {P}. In fact γ is harmonic on ''X'' \ {P}; for ''d''γ = ''d''α − ''d''(''da'') = 0 on ''X'' \ {P} because α is exact there; and similarly ''d''∗γ = 0 using the formula γ = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗α − ''i''∗''da'' and the fact that ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic.

'''Corollary of proof.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique real-valued 1-form δ  which is harmonic on ''X'' \ {''P''} such that δ – Re ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' is harmonic near ''z'' = 0 (the point ''P'')  such that δ is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P''. Moreover, if ''h'' is any real-valued smooth function on ''X'' with ''dh'' square integrable and ''h'' vanishing near ''P'', then (δ,''dh'') = 0.

::Existence follows by taking δ = Re γ = Re ω above. Since ω = δ + ''i''∗δ, the uniqueness of  ω implies the uniqueness of δ. Alternatively if δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two solutions, their difference η = δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has no singularity at ''P'' and is harmonic on ''X'' \ {''P''}. It is therefore harmonic in a neighbourhood of ''P'' and therefore everywhere. So η lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. But also η is exact on ''X'' \ ''P'' and hence on the whole of ''X'', so it also lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But then it must lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0), so that η = 0. Finally, if ''N'' is the closure of a neighbourhood of ''P'' disjoint from the support of ''h'' and ''Y'' = ''X'' \ ''N'', then δ|&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')  and ''dh'' lies in the space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') so that

:::&lt;math&gt;(\delta,dh) =\int_X \delta \wedge \star dh = \int_Y \delta \wedge \star dh = (\delta|_Y,dh)_Y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dirichlet's principle on a Riemann surface==
{{See also|Dirichlet's principle}}
'''Theorem.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–212, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique real-valued harmonic function ''u'' on ''X'' \ {''P''} such that ''u''(''z'') – Re ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is harmonic near ''z'' = 0 (the point ''P'')  such that ''du'' is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P''. Moreover, if ''h'' is any real-valued smooth function on ''X'' with ''dh'' square integrable and ''h'' vanishing near ''P'', then (''du'',''dh'')=0.

::In fact this result is immediate from the theorem and corollary in the previous section. The harmonic form δ constructed there is the real part of a holomorphic form ω = ''dg'' where ''g'' is holomorphic function on ''X'' with a simple pole at ''P'' with residue -1, i.e. ''g''(''z'') = –''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ near ''z'' = 0. So ''u'' = - Re ''g'' gives a solution with the claimed properties since δ = −''du'' and hence (''du'',''dh'') =  −(δ,''dh'') = 0.

This result can be interpreted in terms of [[Dirichlet's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=294–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1955|pages=93–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; be a parametric disk |''z''| &lt; ''R'' about ''P'' (the point ''z'' = 0) with ''R'' &gt; 1. Let α =  −''d''(ψ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), where 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1 is a bump function supported in ''D'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, identically 1 near ''z'' = 0. Let α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') Re ''d''(''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) where χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[characteristic function]]{{dn|date=March 2017}} of ''D''. Let γ= Re α and γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Re  α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since  χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by bump functions in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − γ lies in the real Hilbert space of 1-forms Re ''H''; similarly  α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − α lies in ''H''. Dirichlet's principle states that the distance function

:''F''(ξ) = ||γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − γ – ξ||

on Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is minimised by a smooth 1-form ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact −''du'' coincides with the minimising 1-form: γ + ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = -''du''.

This version of Dirichlet's principle is easy to deduce from the previous construction of ''du''. By definition ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthogonal projection of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – γ  onto Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the real inner product Re (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on ''H'', regarded as a real inner product space. It coincides with the real part of the orthogonal projection ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the complex inner product on ''H''. Since the Hodge star operator is a unitary map on ''H'' swapping ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthogonal projection of  ∗(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; –  α) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, ∗α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −''i'' α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, since α is a (1,0) form. Hence

:(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α) − ''i''∗(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α) = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,

with ω&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. But the left hand side equals – α + ''i''∗α = −β, with β defined exactly as in the preceding section, so this coincides with the previous construction.

Further discussion of Dirichlet's principle on a Riemann surface can be found in {{harvtxt|Hurwitz|Courant|1929}}, {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1947}}, {{harvtxt|Courant|1950}}, {{harvtxt|Schiffer|Spencer|1954}}, {{harvtxt|Pfluger|1957}} and {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|Sario|1960}}.

'''Historical note.''' {{harvtxt|Weyl|1913}} proved the existence of the harmonic function ''u'' by giving a direct proof of Dirichlet's principle. In {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}}, he presented his method of orthogonal projection which has been adopted in the presentation above, following {{harvtxt|Springer|1957}}, but with the theory of Sobolev spaces on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; used to prove elliptic regularity without using measure theory. In the expository texts {{harvtxt|Weyl|1955}} and {{harvtxt|Kodaira|2007}}, both authors avoid invoking results on measure theory: they follow Weyl's original approach for constructing harmonic functions with singularities via Dirichlet's principle. In Weyl's method of orthogonal projection, Lebesgue's theory of integration had been used to realise Hilbert spaces of 1-forms in terms of measurable 1-forms, although the 1-forms to be constructed were smooth or even analytic away from their singularity. In the preface to {{harvtxt|Weyl|1955}}, referring to the extension of his method of orthogonal projection to higher dimensions by {{harvtxt|Kodaira|1949}}, Weyl writes:

::"Influenced by Kodaira's work, I have hesitated a moment as to whether I should not replace the Dirichlet principle by the essentially equivalent "method of orthogonal projection" which is treated in a paper of mine. But for reasons the explication of which would lead too far afield here, I have stuck to the old approach."

In {{harvtxt|Kodaira|2007}}, after giving a brief exposition of the method of orthogonal projection and making reference to Weyl's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|312−314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kodaira explains:

::"I first planned to prove Dirichlet's Principle using the method of orthogonal projection in this book. However, I did not like to have to use the concept of Lebesgue measurability only for the proof of Dirichlet's Principle and therefore I rewrote it in such a way that I did not have to."

The methods of Hilbert spaces, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces and measure theory appear in the non-classical theory of Riemann surfaces (the study of [[moduli space]]s of Riemann surfaces) through the [[Beltrami equation]] and [[Teichmüller theory]].

==Holomorphic 1-forms with two single poles==
'''Theorem.''' Given a Riemann surface ''X'' and two distinct points ''A'' and ''B'' on ''X'', there is a holomorphic 1-form on ''X'' with simple poles at the two points with non-zero residues having sum zero such that the 1-form is square integrable on the complement of any open neighbourhoods of the two points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof is similar to the proof of the result on holomorphic 1-forms with a single double pole. The result is first proved when ''A'' and ''B'' are close and lie in a parametric disk. Indeed, once this is proved, a sum of 1-forms for a chain of sufficiently close points between ''A'' and ''B'' will provide the required 1-form, since the intermediate singular terms will cancel. To construct the 1-form for points corresponding to ''a'' and ''b'' in a parametric disk, the previous construction can be used starting with the 1-form

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = d\left (\psi(z) \log{z-a\over z-b}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which locally has the form

:&lt;math&gt; {dz\over z-a} - {dz\over z-b}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Poisson equation==
{{see also|Poisson equation}}
'''Theorem (Poisson equation).''' If Ω is a smooth 2-form of compact support on a Riemann surface ''X'', then Ω can be written as Ω = ∆''f'' where ''f'' is a smooth function with ''df'' square integrable if and only if  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  Ω = 0.

::In fact, Ω can be written as Ω = ''d''α with α a smooth 1-form of compact support: indeed, using partitions of unity, this reduces to the case of a smooth 2-form of compact support on a rectangle. Indeed Ω can be written as a finite sum of 2-forms each supported in a parametric rectangle and  having integral zero. For each of these 2-forms the result follows from Poincaré's lemma with compact support. Writing α = ω + ''da'' + *''db'', it follows that Ω = ''d''*''db'' = ∆''b''.

In the case of the simply connected Riemann surfaces '''C''', ''D'' and ''S''= '''C''' ∪ ∞, the Riemann surfaces are [[symmetric space]]s ''G'' / ''K'' for the groups ''G'' =  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, SL(2,'''R''') and SU(2). The methods of group representation theory imply the operator ∆ is ''G''-invariant, so that its fundamental solution is given by right convolution by a function  on ''K'' \ ''G'' / ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|2001|page=444–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|pages=104–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in these cases Poisson's equation can be solved by an explicit integral formula. It is easy to verify that this explicit solution tends to 0 at ∞, so that in the case of these surfaces there is a solution ''f'' tending to 0 at ∞. {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2011}} proves this directly for simply connected surfaces and uses it to deduce the [[uniformization theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|2011|pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of indivisibility''' (or '''indivisibility doctrine''') was a [[legal doctrine]] in [[United States copyright law]], which held that a [[copyright]] was a single, indivisible right that its owner could only [[Assignment (law)|assign]] as a whole.  The doctrine was founded upon the policy concern that a [[defendant]] alleged to have infringed a single work might find himself facing claims from multiple [[plaintiff]]s, all claiming copyright in that same work.  Despite the indivisibility doctrine, a copyright holder could still effectively assign certain rights.  The assignees of those rights were held to be "mere licensees."

This doctrine could yield a harsh result for an exclusive licensee in a work.  If a third party [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable.  So courts allowed exclusive licensees to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits.  Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, on the theory that in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.

In the case ''[[Dark Passage|Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.]]'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held that the doctrine of indivisibility could not operate to wholly deprive an author of his copyright when a "mere licensee" secured a copyright in a [[Collective work (US)|collective work]] but the author never secured a separate copyright on his own.

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. Assignees of rights in a copyrighted work now have standing to directly file suit against infringers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10942">{{other uses|Drive reduction theory (learning theory)}}

In [[psychology]], a '''drive theory''' or '''drive doctrine'''&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; is a theory that attempts to define, analyze, or classify the psychological drives. A drive is an "excitatory state produced by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] disturbance",&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203. [https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=rev-63-3-195&amp;site=ehost-live]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; an instinctual need that has the power of driving the [[Behavior|behaviour]] of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_lMAAAAAMAAJ ''Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''] p.25 quotation: {{quotation|Abschnitt I Trieblehre, Kapitel I Das Menschliche Triebsystem. &lt;br /&gt;
Triebe sind Radikale der menschlichen Handlungen und Verhaltungen. Sie sind die bedingenden und erhaltenden Wurzeln des menschlichen Daseins überhaupt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the theory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control system, much like a thermostat.

== Psychoanalysis ==
{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], drive theory ({{lang-de|Triebtheorie}} or ''{{lang|de|Trieblehre}}'')&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; refers to the theory of drives, motivations, or instincts, that have clear objects.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} When an internal imbalance is detected by homeostatic mechanisms, a drive to restore balance is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockenbury |first=Don |date=2012|title=Psychology |location=United States |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=320 |access-date=June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. He was opposed to [[systematics]] in psychology, rejecting it as a form of paranoia, and instead classified drives with dichotomies like [[Eros_(concept)#Sigmund_Freud|Eros]]/[[Death drive|Thanatos]] drives, the drives toward life and death, respectively, and sexual/ego drives.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"&gt;Mélon, Jean (1996), [http://www.szondiforum.org/t419.htm ''Notes on the History of the Szondi Movement''] ([http://www.szondiforum.org/t429.htm French original]). Text for the Szondi Congress of Cracow, August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' was published in Germany in 1930, when the [[Adolf Hitler#Rise to power|rise of fascism]] in that country was well under way, and the warnings of a second European war were leading to opposing calls for rearmament and pacifism. Against this background, Freud wrote "In face of the destructive forces unleashed, now it may be expected that the other of the two 'heavenly forces,' eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain himself alongside of his equally immortal adversary."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1961). ''Civilization and its discontents''. J. Strachey, transl. New York: W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Hungarian [[psychiatrist]] and psychologist [[Leopold Szondi]] aimed instead at a systematic drive theory.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] [1947] (1952), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsUAAAAIAAJ ''Experimental Diagnostics of Drives''], Introduction of the first edition, quotation: {{quotation|A drive system must give us a synthetic sight of the whole of the drive activities, comparable to the total impression which white light gives us, but it must also make it possible to display 'the spectrum' of the drives just like light can be divided in colours. It is an extremely difficult task and it is not at all astonishing that we have not yet arrived at this point.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szondi test#Drive theory and drive diagram|Szondi Drive Diagram]] has been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a [[Psychological anthropology|psychoanalytical anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgwAQAAIAAJ ''Livres de France''] (1989), Issues 106-109 quotation: {{quotation|Cherche à jeter les bases d'une authentique anthropologie psychanalytique d'après le schéma pulsionnel de Szondi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early attachment theory ==

In early [[attachment theory]], behavioural drive reduction was proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950) as an explanation of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural drive reduction theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of [[classical conditioning]], the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by [[Harry Harlow]], particularly the experiments involving the [[Harry Harlow#Surrogate mother experiment|maternal separation of rhesus monkeys]], which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Harlow H F; Zimmermann R. R. (1959). [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3373/421 Affectional responses in the infant monkey] Science, vol(130):421-432. [http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/harlow59.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social psychology==

In [[social psychology]], drive theory was used by [[Robert Zajonc]] in 1965 as an explanation of the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (1965). Social facilitation. ''Science'', ''149'', 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[audience effect]] notes that, in some cases, the presence of a passive audience will facilitate the better performance of a task, while in other cases the presence of an audience will inhibit the performance of a task. Zajonc's drive theory suggests that the variable determining direction of performance is whether the task is composed of a correct dominant response (that is, the task is perceived as being subjectively easy to the individual) or an incorrect dominant response (perceived as being subjectively difficult).

In the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of [[arousal]]. Increased arousal, or [[stress (biological)|stress]], causes the individual to enact behaviours that form dominant responses, since an individual's dominant response is the most likely response, given the skills which are available. If the dominant response is correct, then social presence enhances performance of the task. However, if the dominant response is incorrect, social presence produces an impaired performance.

=== Corroborative evidence ===

Such behaviour was first noticed by Triplett (1898) while observing the cyclists who were racing together versus cyclists who were racing alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It was found that the mere presence of other cyclists produced greater performance. A similar effect was observed by Chen (1937) in [[ant]]s building colonies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, it was not until Zajonc investigated this behaviour in the 1960s that any empirical explanation for the audience effect was pursued.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Zajonc's drive theory is based on an experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zajonc | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Heingartner | first2 = A. | last3 = Herman | first3 = E. M. | doi = 10.1037/h0028063 | title = Social enhancement and impairment of performance in the cockroach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 83 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; involving the investigation of the effect of social facilitation in [[cockroach]]es. Zajonc devised a study in which individual cockroaches were released into a tube, at the end of which there was a light. In the presence of other cockroaches as spectators, cockroaches were observed to achieve a significantly faster time in reaching the light than those in the control, no-spectator group. However, when cockroaches in the same conditions were given a maze to negotiate, performance was impaired in the spectator condition, demonstrating that incorrect dominant responses in the presence of an audience impair performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Evaluation apprehension ===

Cottrell's [[evaluation apprehension model]] later refined this theory to include yet another variable in the mechanisms of social facilitation. He suggested that the correctness of dominant responses only plays a role in social facilitation when there is an expectation of social reward or punishment based on performance. His study differs in design from Zajonc's as he introduced a separate condition in which participants were given tasks to perform in the presence of an audience that was blindfolded, and thus unable to evaluate the participant's performance. It was found that no social facilitation effect occurred, and hence the anticipation of performance evaluation must play a role in social facilitation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Evaluation apprehension, however, is only key in human social facilitation and is not observed in other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

'''Flyby''' is a spacecraft concept whereby one object passes in closer proximity to another, usually a spacecraft maneuver in space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter9-1/#flyby|title=Basics of Space Flight - Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|work=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacecraft which are specifically designed for this purpose are known as flyby spacecraft, although the term has also been used in regard to [[asteroid]] flybys of Earth for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter9-1/#flyby|title=Basics of Space Flight - Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|work=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/40315-asteroid-2018-ge3-surprise-flyby.html|title='Tunguska'-Size Asteroid Makes Surprise Flyby of Earth|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common goals are for exploration or for a [[gravity assist]].

One important subconcept of a flyby in spaceflight, is the time and distance of closest approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cassini-huygens/36019-titan-a-flyby-closest-approach/|title=Titan A Flyby Closest Approach|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distance is often reported, along with a time in regards to flybys in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cassini-huygens/36019-titan-a-flyby-closest-approach/|title=Titan A Flyby Closest Approach|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft flyby==
Flyby maneuvers can be conducted with a planet or non-planet object such as a comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-flight-history/our-spaceflight-heritage-ice-the-first-comet-flyby/|title=Our SpaceFlight Heritage: ICE—The first comet flyby|date=2018-09-12|work=SpaceFlight Insider|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/first-mission-to-mars-mariner-4-s-special-place-in-history|title=First mission to Mars: Mariner 4’s special place in history {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/first-mission-to-mars-mariner-4-s-special-place-in-history|title=First mission to Mars: Mariner 4’s special place in history {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Planetary flyby]]s have occurred with [[Mars]] or [[Earth]] for example:
*[[List of Earth flybys]]
*[[Mars flyby]]

An example of a comet flyby is when [[International Cometary Explorer]] (formerly ISEE-3) passed about 4800 miles (7,800 kilometers) from the [[Comet nucleus|nucleus]] of [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner|Comet Giacobini-Zinner]] in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-flight-history/our-spaceflight-heritage-ice-the-first-comet-flyby/|title=Our SpaceFlight Heritage: ICE—The first comet flyby|date=2018-09-12|work=SpaceFlight Insider|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft is planning to flyby the [[Kuiper belt]] object [[(486958) 2014 MU69|2014 MU69]] on New Year's Day 2019, after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet [[Pluto]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/32049-kbo-2014-mu69.html|title=2014 MU69: Next Target for New Horizons|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of the flyby is of Earth's Moon, usually called a ''lunar flyby''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/spacex-says-its-bfr-will-fly-someone-around-the-moon-we-have-questions/|title=SpaceX says its BFR will fly someone around the Moon; we have questions|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to Mars flybys, a related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where a spacecraft does not enter orbit but rendezvous before or after a flyby of the planet with another spacecraft.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"&gt;{{cite book|pages=15-16|chapter=Chapter 3: EMPIRE and After|first=David S.

In 2018, the twin [[Mars Cube One]] performed a flyby to relay communication for [[InSight]] lander EDL (they were launched towards Mars with the cruise stage carrying the InSight lander).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0501-marco-cubesats-to-mars.html|title=MarCO: CubeSats to Mars!|website=www.planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MarCOs reached Mars and successfully relayed data during the Entry, Descent, and Landing phase of Insight on November 26, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/42541-mars-insight-lander-success.html|title=Touchdown on Mars!

''[[Cassini-Huygens]]'' (launched 1997), which orbited [[Saturn]] (from 2004-2017) performed flybys of many of Saturn's moons including [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cassini-huygens/36019-titan-a-flyby-closest-approach/|title=Titan A Flyby Closest Approach|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cassini-Huygen''{{'}}s had its first flyby of Titan in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cassini-huygens/36019-titan-a-flyby-closest-approach/|title=Titan A Flyby Closest Approach|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further examples of ''Cassini'' flybys of Saturn's moons see [[Timeline of Cassini–Huygens|Timeline of ''Cassini-Huygens'']].

The '''''Fountain Archive''''' (also called '''''The Fountain Archives''''' or '''''Fountain Archive Project''''') is a [[wiktionary:processual|processual]] art project of the French conceptual artist [[Saâdane Afif]] which started in 2008/ 2009. The project includes an ongoing series of framed pages which contain one or several reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Here Afif uses the concept of the [[Found object|Objet trouvés]] (found object) and tears off the pages from different publications. For each publication and pages Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archives'', which is created as a work of art. 

The ''Fountain Archive'' also includes a bookshelf which stores all used publications of the project.

==Origin and description==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|''Fountain'', 1917, signed "R. Mutt"]]
In 2008 Saâdane Afif started to collect publications which contain reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917) by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. After he was distinguished with the Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2009, Afif began the ''Fountain Archive''. At present the ''Fountain Archive'' contains over 600 images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/current-bibliography/ |title=Current bibliography |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Duchamp’s porcelain urinal. In this work, Afif collects and archives every publication in which he finds a reproduction of Duchamp's urinal. As a “found object” every page containing the picture of the ''Fountain'' is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame (sometimes with a colored background), used for its preservation and highlight ornament purposes, is also part of the making process. Every step of the archiving follows meticulous rules which participate entirely in the making process of these works of art. For each publication and page Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"&gt;Valentina Vlasic: Saâdane Afif, in: The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future, Schriftenreihe Museum Kurhaus Kleve – Ewald Mataré-Sammlung Nr. 62, Freundeskreis Museum Kurhaus und Koekkoek-Haus Kleve e.V. (Hrsg), 2013, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a publication contains images of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' on several pages, all of them are torn off and form together a polyptych. When found, the publications are registered with an archive number ranging from FA 0001 potentially to infinite. Afif intended to continue the Series of Archives until its 1001st. The publications (sans ''Fountain'') are then stored in a bookshelf in the studio of the artist. The bookshelf creates an archive around Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', from which the common initiator has been removed: “an archive without its object“. The ''Fountain Archives'' has been presented in various exhibitions throughout the world.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/about/ |title=About |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, some publications presenting this project by Afif happened to reproduce the work ''Fountain'' of Duchamp. Those specific documents are also incorporated in the ''Fountain Archives'' project. But they are treated as special objects as they are doubled in order to testify of a historical echo, mark a [[mise en abyme]]. In case of the mise en abyme – a publication includes an image of Afif's ''Fountain Archive'' project – there is also one exception to the strict rule that each publication produced only a unique, singular work of the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines. Triangle Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-2-930777-05-4}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These pages underline an evolution in the development and perception of the ''Fountain Archives'' as an artwork. They are stored under a specific section titled “Augmented”, and they are building a step-by-step archive within the archive. Therefore, two copies of the publications (sans ''Fountain'') enter the archive bookshelf and two editions of the work are made.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==History==
In 2013 a group of 101 ''Fountain Archives'' were shown in the exhibition “The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future” based in the Museum Kurhaus Kleve. Referring to the presentation a first text, by the art historic Valentina Vlasic, about the ''Fountain Archive'' was published in the exhibition catalogue. This catalogue contribution included a picture of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', therefore Afif tears the page off and makes an augmented fountain archive out of it. This said Klever Fountain, with the description FA 0366,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/fountain-archives/fa-0366/ |title=FA 0366 |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based in the collection of the Museum Kurhaus Kleve as a permanent loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrz.de/staedte/kleve-und-umland/das-pissoir-im-archiv-der-bilder-id9479188.html|title=Das Pissoir im Archiv der Bilder|last=Gronewald|first=Claudia|access-date=2017-11-26|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The German art historian Eva Huttenlauch named Marcel Duchamp as Afif’s guiding star, he looked up as his ideal self. Many of Afif’s concepts, like the ''Fountain Archive'', rest on the foundations Duchamp laid.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Huttenlauch: ''Everything must be scandalous'', in: Saâdane Afif. ''Another Anthology of Black Humor'', published by Susanne Gaensheimer and Eva Huttenlauch, Verlag für Moderne Kunst, Nürnberg 2012, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian art historian Valentina Vlasic termed Afif’s ''Fountain Archive'' as a repetition of the key-moment of the ready-made, the fundamental act of selecting which just as it did at that time for Duchamp, represents a complete artistic achievement. Afif does not do this with real objects, like a normal commercial one, but he uses the artistic object of the ''Fountain'' as an illustration from publications. As a charming witticism, Vlasic predicated that there is in addition the fact that Afif leads Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in a new way back into the museum, a site it had to leave about one hundred years ago through being excluded from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"/&gt;
    
For the art historian Elena Filipovic, the high importance of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history accrued especially because of the reason that the artist understood very well that the reproduction, display, framing, dissemination, and reception of an artwork not only constructs its value and meaning, but also help determine how and if it enters history at all. These comprehension stands also for the background of Saâdane Afifs project of the ''Fountain Archives''.  After “R.Mutt“ or Marcel Duchamp Fillipovic sees in Afif another person which adopts the white urinal and also conducts the construction of an icon. The ''Fountain Archives'', which contain an image of a ''Fountain Archive'' (mise en abyme), are termed as a “remake” by Filipovic. She compares especially these works with the process of signification of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines. Triangle Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-2-930777-05-4}}, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gay pride''' or '''LGBT pride''' is the positive stance against discrimination and violence toward [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)]] people to promote their [[self-affirmation]], dignity, equality rights, increase their visibility as a [[social group]], build community, and celebrate [[sexual diversity]] and [[gender variance]]. Pride, as opposed to shame and [[social stigma]], is the predominant outlook that bolsters most [[LGBT rights]] movements throughout the world. Pride has lent its name to LGBT-themed organizations, institutes, foundations, book titles, periodicals and even a [[OutTV (Canada)|cable TV station]] and the [[Pride Library]].

Ranging from solemn to carnivalesque, pride events are typically held during [[Gay pride#LGBT Pride Month|LGBT Pride Month]] or some other period that commemorates a turning point in a country's [[LGBT history]], for example [[Moscow Pride]] in May for the anniversary of Russia's 1993 decriminalization of homosexuality. Some pride events include [[Pride parade|LGBT pride parades and marches]], rallies, commemorations, community days, dance parties, and large festivals, such as [[Sydney Mardi Gras]], which spans several weeks.

Common symbols of pride are the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow or pride flag]], the lowercase Greek letter [[lambda (letter)|lambda (λ)]], the [[pink triangle]] and the [[Black triangle (badge)|black triangle]], these latter two [[Reappropriation|reclaimed]] from use as [[badges of shame]] in [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm|title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements

==Historical background==
[[File:Barbara Gittings 1965.jpg|thumb|Gay equality activist [[Barbara Gittings]] picketing  [[Independence Hall]] in 1965]]

===Pride precursors===
{{Main|List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots}}

====Annual Reminders====
The 1950s and 1960s in the United States was an extremely repressive legal and social period for LGBT people. In this context American [[homophile]] organizations such as the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] and the [[Mattachine Society]] coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern LGBT rights movement. These two organizations in particular carried out [[Picketing (protest)|pickets]] called "[[Annual Reminder]]s" to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic [[civil rights]] protections. Annual Reminders began in 1965 and took place each July 4 at [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]].

===="Gay is Good"====
The anti-LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness.  Inspired by [[Stokely Carmichael]]'s "[[Black is beautiful|Black is Beautiful]]", Gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the Annual Reminders [[Frank Kameny]] originated the slogan "Gay is Good" in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f.html |title=Kameny, Frank |publisher=glbtq |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524210331/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f.html |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame.

===Christopher Street Liberation Day===
{{See also|Stonewall riots}}

Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning persons rioted following a police raid on the [[Stonewall Inn]], a gay bar at 43 Christopher Street, New York City. This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in modern LGBT rights movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale.

On November 2, 1969, [[Craig Rodwell]], his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/1970-a-first-person-account-of-the-first-gay-pride-march// Sargeant, Fred. "1970: A First-Person Account of the First Gay Pride March." ''The Village Voice''. June 22, 2010.] retrieved January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
"That the Annual Reminder, in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged—that of our fundamental human rights—be moved both in time and location.

&lt;br&gt;We propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY. No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration.

&lt;br&gt;We also propose that we contact Homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day. We propose a nationwide show of support.&lt;ref name="Carter, pg. 230"&gt;Carter, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marotta, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teal, pp. 322–323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, pp. 255, 262, 270–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for [[Mattachine Society]] of New York, which abstained.&lt;ref name="Carter, pg. 230"/&gt; Members of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 [[Bleecker Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/nyregion/for-gays-party-search-purpose-30-parade-has-gone-mainstream-movement-s-goals.html Nagourney, Adam. "For Gays, a Party In Search of a Purpose; At 30, Parade Has Gone Mainstream As Movement's Goals Have Drifte." ''The New York Times''. June 25, 2000.] retrieved January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At first there was difficulty getting some of the major [[New York City]] organizations like [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]], Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teal, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and [[Brenda Howard]] of GLF.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 314 n93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brenda Howard]] is known as the "Mother of Pride" for her work in coordinating the march. Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around [[pride parade|Pride Day]] which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref name="thirteen.org"&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118011642/http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 |date=January 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="queerty.com"&gt;[http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ The Gay Pride Issue: Picking Apart The Origin of Pride] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712233212/http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ |date=July 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT Activists [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A.

Christopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street and the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride march]] in U.S. history, covering the 51&amp;nbsp;blocks to [[Central Park]]. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&amp;nbsp;city blocks.&lt;ref name="fosburgh"&gt;Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

One day earlier, on Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', June 28, 1970, p. A3&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square Park]] ("Bughouse Square") to the [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] at the intersection of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and [[Chicago Avenue|Chicago]] avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the [[Richard J.

Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.

The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in [[Boston]], [[Dallas]], [[Milwaukee]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[West Berlin]], and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="lafrank20"/&gt; By 1972 the participating cities included [[Atlanta]], [[Brighton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Brighton Ourstory |title=A History of Lesbian &amp; Gay Brighton: A Community Comes of Age, 1988-2001 |url=http://www.brightonourstory.co.uk/brighton-s-history/a-history-of-lesbian-and-gay-brighton-chapter-3-out-of-the-closet-1967-87/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Miami]], and [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref name="armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&amp;nbsp;M. (October 2006).

Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, p. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as "one of the greatest mistakes of his life".&lt;ref name="clendinen25"&gt;Clendinen, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of gays retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals".&lt;ref name="clendinen25"/&gt; Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement.... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale."&lt;ref&gt;LaFrank, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
[[File:2018 San Francisco Pride.jpg|thumb|right|San Francisco Pride 2018]]
In the 1980s there was a major cultural shift in the Stonewall Riot commemorations.  The previous loosely organized, grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community. The marches began dropping "Liberation" and "Freedom" from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community, replacing them with the philosophy of "Gay Pride"{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (in the more liberal [[San Francisco]], the name of [[The Gay Parade|the gay parade]] and celebration was not changed from ''Gay Freedom Day Parade'' to ''Gay Pride Day Parade'' until 1994). The Greek [[lambda]] symbol and the [[pink triangle]], which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings{{clarify|date=May 2015}}. The pink triangle was also the inspiration for the [[homomonument]] in [[Amsterdam]], commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality.

=== LGBT Pride Month ===

[[File:StatehouseBoisePride2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] Pride at the [[Idaho Capitol]].]]
The month of June was chosen for LGBT Pride Month to commemorate the [[Stonewall riots]], which occurred at the end of June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world. [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the ''"Mother of Pride"'', for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref name="thirteen.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queerty.com"/&gt; Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT rights activists [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk)]] and [[L. Craig Schoonmaker]] are credited with popularizing the word "Pride" to describe these festivities.&lt;ref name="Pride trope, Homolexis"/&gt; As LGBT rights activist [[Tom Limoncelli]] put it, "The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'"&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

On several occasions, the President of the United States has officially declared a Pride Month. First, President [[Bill Clinton]] declared June "Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month" on June 11, 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |last = Clinton |first = Bill |date = 11 June 1999 |title = Proclamation 7203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clinton Declares June 2000 Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/blgaylesproc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206050022/http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/blgaylesproc.htm |archivedate=2017-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |last = Clinton |first = Bill |date = 2 June 2000 |title = Proclamation 7316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2009 |date= 1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010,&lt;ref name="2010 Proclamation"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Proclamation 8429 |date= 28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011,&lt;ref name="2011 Proclamation"&gt;{{cite news |title=Presidential Proclamation--Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/31/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidential Proclamation--Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2012|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/01/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/03/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month&lt;/ref&gt; 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 30, 2014 |title=Presidential Proclamation -- Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2014 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/30/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 29, 2015 |title=Presidential Proclamation-- LGBT Pride Month, 2015 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/29/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 31, 2016 |title=Presidential Proclamation -- LGBT Pride Month, 2016 |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/31/presidential-proclamation-lgbt-pride-month-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] declared June LGBT Pride Month.

==Criticism==
From both outside and inside the LGBT community, there is criticism and protest against pride events. Bob Christie's documentary ''[[Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride]]'' evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition.

===Initiatives and criticism by governments and political leaders===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}

====Brazil====
In August 2011, [[Sao Paulo]] [[city alderman]] [[:pt:Carlos Apolinário|Carlos Apolinário]] of the right-wing [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] Party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor "Heterosexual Pride Day" on the third Sunday of December. The bill was passed by the city council, and awaits the signature of mayor [[Gilberto Kassab]]. Apolinário, an Evangelical Protestant, stated that the intent of the parade was a "struggle ... against excesses and privileges". Members of [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] criticized the bill as enhancing "the possibility of discrimination and prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2011/0804/Heterosexual-Pride-Day-in-Sao-Paulo|title = 'Heterosexual Pride Day' in São Paulo?|author = Andrew Downie|newspaper = The Christian Science Monitor|date = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no events have ever been held.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A Brazilian photographer was arrested after refusing to delete photos of police attacking two young people participating in a gay pride parade on October 16, 2011 in the city of Itabuna, Bahia, reported the newspaper Correio 24 horas.

According to the website Notícias de Ipiau, Ederivaldo Benedito, known as Bené, said four police officers tried to convince him to delete the photos soon after they realized they were being photographed. When he refused, they ordered him to turn over the camera. When the photographer refused again, the police charged him with contempt and held him in jail for over 21 hours until he gave a statement.

According to Chief Marlon Macedo, the police alleged that the photographer was interfering with their work, did not have identification, and became aggressive when he was asked to move. Bené denied the allegations, saying the police were belligerent and that the scene was witnessed by "over 300 people", reported Agência Estado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photos of police attack at gay pride parade land Brazilian journalist in jail |author=Natalia Mazotte |date=October 24, 2011 |agency=ZD |publisher=Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, Moody College of Communication, The University of Texas at Austin |url = https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/photos-police-attack-gay-pride-parade-land-brazilian-journalist-jail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In a 2008 interview for the biography book ''La Reina muy cerca'' (The Queen Up Close) by Spanish journalist and writer [[Pilar Urbano]], [[Queen Sofía of Spain]] sparked off controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censuring the [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spanish Law on Marriage]] in how it names equal same-sex unions "matrimonio" (marriage). Albeit without using the slogan "Straight Pride", Queen Sofía was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades, that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20081101/53570777333.html Pilar Urbano attribute to Queen Sofía polemic comments] ''La Vanguardia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Royal Household of Spain]] approved publication of the interview and Pilar Urbano offered to share the interview recording, both Queen Sofía and the Royal Household have refuted the comments in question.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"/&gt;

====Turkey====
In 2015 police dispersed the [[Pride parade|LGBT Pride Parade]] using tear gas and rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/governors-office-bans-lgbt-pride-march-in-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=114708&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=Governor’s Office bans LGBT Pride March in Istanbul|newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 and 2017 [[Governor of İstanbul|Istanbul Governor's Office]] didn't allow the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/governors-office-bans-lgbt-pride-march-in-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=114708&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=Governor’s Office bans LGBT Pride March in Istanbul|publisher=hurriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
In 2016, Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ugandan police break up gay pride event |agency=Associated Press |date=August 5, 2016 |publisher=CTV News |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/ugandan-police-break-up-gay-pride-event-1.3015989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Uganda|Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda]].

===In-group===
In a special [[queer]] issue of ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' in 1999, [[Coming out|openly gay]] author, pundit, and journalist [[Dan Savage]] questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, as well as being a constant reminder of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pride |newspaper=The Stranger |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/pride/Content?oid=1313 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002211/http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/pride/Content?oid=1313 |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth and commercialization of Christopher Street Days, coupled with their de-politicalisation, has led to an alternative CSD in Berlin, the so-called [[Kreuzberg Pride|"Kreuzberger CSD" or "Transgenialer"]] ("Transgenial"/Trans Ingenious") CSD. Political party members are not invited for speeches, nor can parties or companies sponsor floats. After the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers. Groups discuss lesbian/transsexual/transgender/gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits (Hartz IV), gentrification, or "Fortress Europe".

In June 2010, American philosopher and theorist [[Judith Butler]] refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial, and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/videos/racism-and-commercialization/ I must distance myself from this complicity with racism (Video)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305185509/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/videos/racism-and-commercialization/ |date=March 5, 2012 }} [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/articles/i-must-distance-myself/ (Transcript).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322041929/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/articles/i-must-distance-myself/ |date=March 22, 2012 }} Christopher Street Day 'Civil Courage Prize' Day Refusal Speech. [[European Graduate School]]. June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The general manager of the CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler's allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers don't require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €. He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and islamophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Ataman, Ferda / Kögel, Annette / Hasselmann, Jörg: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtleben/heftige-diskussionen-nach-kritik-an-csd-/1864540.html "Butler-Auftritt: Heftige Diskussionen nach Kritik an CSD"], ''Der Tagesspiegel'' (Berlin). July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of associations and social movements have been denouncing in recent years which, in its views, is a depletion of the claims of these demonstrations and the ''[[merchandization]]'' of the parade. In this respect, they defend, in countries like Spain, the United States or Canada, a ''[[Pink capitalism#Current protest movements in Spain|Critical Pride]]'' celebration to have a political meaning again.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://blogs.publico.es/shangaylily/2014/07/02/gaypitalismo-orgullo-empresarial/ Gaypitalismo: Orgullo Empresarial.] ''Público''.

==="Straight Pride" analogy===
{{Main|Straight pride}}
"Straight Pride" and "Heterosexual Pride" are analogies and slogans that oppose heterosexuality to homosexuality by copying the phrase "Gay Pride".&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts. Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth}}, page 20. "A relatively recent tactic used in the backlash opposing les/bi/gay/trans campus visibility is the so-called "heterosexual pride" strategy".&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from the [[Culture War]]s in the United States, "Straight Pride" is a form of conservative [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] as there is no straight or heterosexual [[civil rights]] movement. While criticism from inside and outside the LGBT community abounds, the "Straight Pride" incidents have, however, gained some media attention especially when they involve government and public institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17010">The topic of gender and emotion is often reduced to attempts to identify the differences between women, men, and the various ways in which they express their emotions. Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the Western stereotype that women are more emotional than men.&lt;ref name= kring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kring | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.686 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 686–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. 

Many researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized [[gender role]]s, rather than biology.  Thus, the range of [[emotional expression]] that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women.  Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive [[emotionality]]. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt; Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity.  Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt;
A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J. A. | year = 2008 | title = Gender and emotion in context | url = | journal = Handbook of emotions | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger.  However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain [[socialization]] processes.&lt;ref name = jansz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jansz | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = [[Masculine]] identity and restrictive emotionality | url = | journal = Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 166–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively."&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures – women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.&lt;ref name =  fischer&gt;Fischer, A. H., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71–98). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions – men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt; However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  For example, in [[Japan]], research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors.  "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed".&lt;ref name = wester/&gt;  One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present.  In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present.&lt;ref name = derks/&gt;  In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger were judged as more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coats | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. S. | year = 1996 | title = Gender differences in nonverbal correlates of social status | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1014–1022 | doi=10.1177/01461672962210004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressors of gender-stereotypical emotions.

These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues – angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls.  Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's [[emotion]]s.  For this reason, emoticons are widely used  in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings.  Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons.  In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat.  Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men.&lt;ref name = derks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derks | first1 = Daantje | last2 = Fischer | first2 = Agneta H. | last3 = Bos | first3 = Arjan E.R. | year = 2008 | title = The role of emotion in computer-mediated communication: A review | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 766–785 | doi =  10.1016/j.chb.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature versus nurture==
{{Main article|Nature versus nurture}}
The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression.  The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing "children's active role in their development of gendered behavior" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name= chaplin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = T. | last2 = Aldao | first2 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Gender differences in emotion expression in children: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/bul-a0030737.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 4| pages = 735–765 | doi=10.1037/a0030737 | pmid=23231534 | pmc=3597769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age.  In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as "gender differences were not found in infancy…but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood".&lt;ref name= chaplin /&gt; One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents.  In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons.&lt;ref name = wester&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = http://www.sagepub.com/counselingstudy/Journal%20Articles/Wester.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers.

The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences.  The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context.  Gender stereotypes in [[heteronormative]] societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions.  Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, &amp; Heesacker, 2002).&lt;ref name = wester/&gt; As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation.  Studies have shown that "fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person" (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name=chaplin /&gt; Generally, people are trained to behave in a "socially acceptable" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression.

Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression.  One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. "Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, &amp; Gross, 2008).&lt;ref name="mcrae"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McRae|first1=K.|last2=Ochsner|first2=K. N.|last3=Mauss|first3=I. B.|last4=Gabrieli|first4=J. J.|last5=Gross|first5=J. J.|year=2008|title=Gender differences in emotion regulation: An fMRI study of cognitive reappraisal|url=|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–162|doi=10.1177/1368430207088035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions.

The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways.  Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; An important argument for this viewpoint is that "gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L | year = 1997 | title = Gender and Emotion: Beyond Stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 369–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1997.tb02448.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically-based characteristics.  This "nature" argument interacts with "nurture" in that "parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness…as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels".&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.

== "Man-box" ==
References to a figurative "man-box", an idea often attributed to [[TED (conference)|TED]] speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Tony|title=A call to men|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his organization, ''A Call to Men'', Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess "healthy manhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acalltomen.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Mission/Vision|website=A Call To Men|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments.

==Controversies==
Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion.  Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite.  This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.&lt;ref name = derks /&gt;

Used colloquially as a [[noun]] or [[adjective]], "'''highbrow'''" is [[synonym]]ous with [[intellectual]]; as an adjective, it also means [[elite]], and generally carries a [[connotation]] of [[high culture]]. The word draws its [[metonymy]] from the [[pseudoscience]] of [[phrenology]], and was originally simply a physical descriptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=Dr. [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1828), founder of the 'science' of phrenology, gave support to the old folk notion that people with big foreheads have more brains. The theory, later discredited, led to the expression 'highbrow' for an intellectual, which is first recorded in 1875.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
"Highbrow" can be applied to [[music]], implying most of the [[European classical music|classical music]] tradition; to literature—i.e., [[literary fiction]] and [[poetry]]; to films in the [[art film|arthouse]] line; and to comedy that requires significant understanding of analogies or references to appreciate. The term ''highbrow'' is considered by some (with corresponding labels as 'middlebrow' 'lowbrow') as discriminatory or overly selective;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. Levine, "Prologue", ''Highbrow/Lowbrow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America'', 1990: 3&lt;/ref&gt; and ''highbrow'' is currently distanced from the writer by quotation marks: "We thus focus on the consumption of two generally recognised 'highbrow' genres—opera and classical".&lt;ref&gt;Tak Wing Chan, ''Social Status and Cultural Consumption'' 2010: 60&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage in print of ''highbrow'' was recorded in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Highbrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in 1902 by Will Irvin, a reporter for ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' who adhered to the phrenological notion of more intelligent people having high foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=New York Sun reporter Will Irvin popularized 'highbrow,' and its opposite 'lowbrow' in 1902, basing his creation on the wrongful notion that people with high foreheads have bigger brains and are more intelligent and intellectual than those with low foreheads. At first the term was complimentary, but 'Tristi' came to be at best a neutral word.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

The opposite of ''highbrow'' is ''[[low culture|lowbrow]]'', and between them is ''[[middlebrow]]'', describing culture that is neither high nor low; as a usage, ''middlebrow'' is derogatory, as in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s unsent letter to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', written in the 1930s and published in ''The Death of the Moth and Other Essays'' (1942). According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''middlebrow'' first appeared in print in 1925, in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': "The [[BBC]] claims to have discovered a new type—'the middlebrow'. It consists of people who are hoping that some day they will get used to the stuff that they ought to like".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Micki McGee, ''Yaddo: Making American Culture'', 106: McGee outlines the history of the highbrow/lowbrow debate.&lt;/ref&gt; The term had previously appeared in hyphenated form in 1912:
{{quotation | [[The Nation]], 25th of January, 1912:
:[T]here is an alarmingly wide chasm, I might almost say a vacuum, between the high-brow, who considers reading either as a trade or as a form of intellectual wrestling, and the low-brow, who is merely seeking for gross thrills. It is to be hoped that culture will soon be democratized through some less conventional system of education, giving rise to a new type that might be called the middle-brow, who will consider books as a source of intellectual enjoyment.
}}

It was popularized by the American writer and poet [[Margaret Widdemer]], whose essay "Message and Middlebrow" appeared in the ''Review of Literature'' in 1933. The three [[genre fiction|genres of fiction]], as American readers approached them in the 1950s and as obscenity law differentially judged them, are the subject of Ruth Pirsig Wood, ''Lolita in Peyton Place: Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow Novels'', 1995.

==Cultural examples==
[[Prince Hamlet]] was considered by [[Virginia Woolf]] as a highbrow lacking orientation in the world once he had lost the lowbrow [[Ophelia]] with her grip on earthly realities: this, she thought, explained why in general highbrows "honour so wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called lowbrows".&lt;ref&gt;A. Fox, ''Virginia Woolf and the Literature of the English Renaissnce'' (1990) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">In [[computer science]], and in particular [[functional programming]], a '''hylomorphism''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] function, corresponding to the [[function composition|composition]] of an [[anamorphism]] (which first builds a set of results; also known as 'unfolding') followed by a [[catamorphism]] (which then [[fold (higher-order function)|folds]] these results into a final [[return value]]). Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of [[deforestation (computer science)|deforestation]], a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a '''metamorphism''', which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.

==Formal definition==

A hylomorphism &lt;math&gt;h : A \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in terms of its separate anamorphic and catamorphic parts.

The anamorphic part can be defined in terms of a [[arity|unary]] function &lt;math&gt;g : A \rightarrow B \times A&lt;/math&gt; defining the list of elements in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by repeated application (''"unfolding"''), and a [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;p : A \rightarrow \text{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; providing the terminating condition.

The catamorphic part can be defined as a combination of an initial value &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt; for the fold and a binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus : B \times C \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; used to perform the fold.

Thus a hylomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;
h\,a = \begin{cases}
 c &amp; \mbox{if } p\,a
 \\b \oplus h\,a' \,\,\,where \,(b, a') = g\,a &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
may be defined (assuming appropriate definitions of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;).

===Notation===
An abbreviated notation for the above hylomorphism is &lt;math&gt;h = [\![(c, \oplus),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Hylomorphisms in practice==

===Lists===
[[List (computing)|Lists]] are common data structures as they naturally reflect linear computational processes.  These processes arise in repeated ([[Iteration|iterative]]) function calls.  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to generate a temporary list of intermediate results before reducing this list to a single result.

One example of a commonly encountered hylomorphism is the canonical [[factorial]] function.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n
  | n == 0 = 1
  | n &gt; 0 = n * factorial (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

In the previous example (written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], a [[purely functional programming language]]) it can be seen that this function, applied to any given valid input, will generate a linear call tree [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a list. For example, given ''n'' = 5 it will produce the following:

 factorial 5 = 5 * (factorial 4) = 120
 factorial 4 = 4 * (factorial 3) = 24
 factorial 3 = 3 * (factorial 2) = 6
 factorial 2 = 2 * (factorial 1) = 2
 factorial 1 = 1 * (factorial 0) = 1
 factorial 0 = 1

In this example, the anamorphic part of the process is the generation of the call tree which is isomorphic to the list &lt;code&gt;[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt;. The catamorphism, then, is the calculation of the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of this list. Thus, in the notation given above, the factorial function may be written &lt;math&gt;\text{factorial} = [\![(1,\times),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g\ n = (n, n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\ n = (n = 0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Trees===

However, the term 'hylomorphism' does not apply solely to functions acting upon isomorphisms of lists. For example, a hylomorphism may also be defined by generating a non-linear call tree which is then collapsed. An example of such a function is the function to generate the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[term (mathematics)|term]] of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 fibonacci :: Integer -&gt; Integer
 fibonacci n
   | n == 0 = 0
   | n == 1 = 1
   | n &gt; 1 = fibonacci (n - 2) + fibonacci (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Fib 4.png|thumb|300px|Call tree for &lt;code&gt;fibonacci 4&lt;/code&gt;.]]

This function, again applied to any valid input, will generate a call tree which is non-linear. In the example on the right, the call tree generated by applying the &lt;code&gt;fibonacci&lt;/code&gt; function to the input &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;.

This time, the anamorphism is the generation of the call tree isomorphic to the tree with [[leaf node]]s &lt;code&gt;0, 1, 1, 0, 1&lt;/code&gt; and the catamorphism the [[summation]] of these leaf nodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18790">'''Behavioral marital therapy''', sometimes called '''behavioral couples therapy''', has its origins in [[behaviorism]] and is a form of [[behavior therapy]]. The theory is rooted in [[social learning theory]] and [[behavior analysis]]. As a model, it is constantly being revised as new research presents.

==History==
Behavioral marital therapy started with simple research conducted on couples in the 1960s. Robert Weiss and Richard Stuart were the original authors of such research.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, J.P., Weiss, R.L. &amp; Birchler, G.R.(1975). A behavioral analysis of problem solving in distressed and nondistressed married and stranger dyads. ''Behavior Therapy, 6,'' 475–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, R.B.(1969). Operant-interpersonal treatment of marital discord. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 33'', 675–682.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1970s Nathan Azrin published his concept of mutal reinforcement and reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;Azrin, NH, Naster, BJ, and Jone, R. (1973). Reciprocity counseling: A rapid learning-based procedure for marital counseling. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 11, 365–382.&lt;/ref&gt; Azrin stated that (1) human behavior is maintained by reinforcement on the person who performed the behavior (2) people have a tendency to treat others as they are treated and (3) mutual reinforcement accounts at least partially for concepts like friendships, joy, and love. Neil Jacobson pioneered the behavioral marital therapy approach. He published a book with Gayla Margolin, which launched a social learning model of couples therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson and Margolin (1979).''Marital therapy: Strategies based on social learning and behavior exchange principles.'' New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model of therapy, partners learn to be nicer to each other through behavioral exchange (contingency contracts), communicate better and improve their conflict-resolution skills. Early support came when Gottman found that as long as the ratio of positive to negative interactions remains at least five to one, the relationship is sturdy. When the ratio dips below there is a 94 percent chance that a couple will divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, J. M., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1999). "What predicts change in marital interaction over time? A study of alternative models." ''[[Family Process (journal)|Family Process]]'', 38 (2), pp.143–158&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have found a role for exchanges as well.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A.M. (1979). The quantity and quality of marital interaction related to marital satisfaction: A behavioral analysis. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 12,'' 665–678&lt;/ref&gt;  Behavioral marital therapy model remains the most researched model of [[family therapy]] and was found to be effective for treating marital discord and depression in women.&lt;ref&gt;William O'Donohue and Kyle E. Ferguson (2006): Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(3)'' 335- 347 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the behavioral couples therapy model, in particular strategic use of the communication skills to reinforce drug abstinence and open dialogue about treatment,  were introduced as a method for getting drug abusing partners into treatment ''(see [[Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.E., Milford, J.L and  Meyers, R.J. (2004). CRA and CRAFT: Behavioral Approaches to Treating Substance-Abusing Individuals. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 5.(4),''  391–402 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research suggested that the components of behavioral marital therapy worked as predicted. The social exchange component led to increases in marital satisfaction in the short run. The communication training program led couples to communicate better and produced more long term changes in contingencies between couple members.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N. S., &amp; Follette, W. C. (1985). Clinical significance of improvement resulting from two behavioral marital therapy components. ''Behavior Therapy, 16,'' 249–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disillusionment with the traditional model began with a study in which it was found that only 50% of couples responded to the therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Berns S, Wheeler J, Baucom DH, &amp; Simpson LE (2004) Traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy for significantly and chronically distressed married couples. ''J Consult Clin Psychol.72(2),'' 176–91&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, traditional couple therapy did not produce more significant outcomes compared to insight-oriented couple therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder DK &amp; Wills RM. (1989). Behavioral versus insight-oriented marital therapy: Effects on individual and interspousal functioning''.J Consult Clin Psychol. 57(1)'' 39–46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT) was developed by Neil S. Jacobson and Andrew Christensen.  The model represents a return to contextualism, functional analysis and Skinner's distinction between contingency shaped and rule governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, A., Jacobson, N.S. &amp; Babcock, J.C. (1995). Integrative behavioral couples therapy. In N.S. Jacobson &amp; A.S. Gurman (Eds.) Clinical Handbook for Couples Therapy (pp. 31–64). New York: Guildford.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy is "integrative" in at least two senses: First, it integrates the twin goals of acceptance and change as positive outcomes for couples in therapy. Couples who succeed in therapy usually make some concrete changes to accommodate the needs of the other but they also show greater emotional acceptance of the other. Second, IBCT integrates a variety of treatment strategies under a consistent behavioral theoretical framework. It is considered a third generation [[behavior therapy]] or sometimes called [[clinical behavior analysis]].

Both the integrative and traditional behavioral couples therapy models have origins primarily in [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cordova: (2003) Behavior Analysis and the Scientific Study of Couples. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (4),'' 412 -425 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional behavioral couples therapy has more roots in [[social learning theory|social learning]] principles and the later model in Skinnerian behaviorism. The latter model draws heavily on the use of [[functional analysis (psychology)]] and the Skinnerian distinction between contingency shaped and rule governed behavior to balance acceptance and change in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., and Eldridge, K. (2000). Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy An Acceptance-Based, Promising New Treatment for Couple Discord, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 68, 351–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapman and Compton: (2003) From Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy to Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy: New Research Directions ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 17 -25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
IBCT consists of two major phases, an evaluation/feedback phase and an active treatment phase. The first three sessions consist of an evaluation period where the therapist learns about the concerns of the couple. In the first session, the therapist usually sees both partners together, learns what brings the couple to therapy, and obtains a brief history of their relationship. The therapist may suggest couples read a self-help book during treatment that serves as a guideline for IBCT therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, A. &amp; Jacobson, N. S. (2000). ''Reconcilable Differences.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this first session, the therapist normally gives each partner some questionnaires to complete and bring to their individual sessions, which are the next two sessions. In these individual sessions, the therapist explores each partner's relationship concerns and individual history. In the fourth session, the therapist sees both partners together for the "feedback session." The therapist may gather some final information in the beginning of the session, but most of the session is devoted to feedback from the therapist, in which he or she describes the couple's difficulties and strengths and how therapy will try to assist the couple. A major part of the feedback session is the therapist's formulation of the couple's problems, a conceptualization of the major themes in the couple's struggles, the understandable reasons why the couple has these struggles, how their efforts to resolve the struggles so often fail, and how therapy can help. The couple actively participates in this feedback, giving their reactions, adding information, and correcting the therapist's impressions as needed.

After the feedback session, the couple can make an informed decision about whether the therapist and treatment seem right for them. Assuming they decide positively, then the active phase of treatment begins. Sessions at this point are almost always done jointly, with both members of the couple and the therapist. The focus is often on important recent incidents, positive or negative, that reflect their major theme or themes. For example, if a major theme concerned partners' difficulties in achieving emotional intimacy, the couple might discuss a recent incident in which they were able to achieve a sense of closeness with each other or an incident in which one or both reached out to the other but felt rebuffed. Similarly, if a major theme involved frequent struggles over decision-making, they might discuss a recent incident where they were able to reach agreement on a matter or an incident where they got into a negative, escalating conflict about an issue on which they disagreed. Upcoming incidents related to a couple's theme, such as a difficult, upcoming decision that the couple must make, and broader issues related to a couple's theme, such as how partners in a couple who struggles to achieve emotional intimacy react when their feelings are hurt, are also a focus of discussion. In these discussions, the therapist is often quite active, helping the partners communicate more openly, directly, and clearly, helping them identify the patterns that get them stuck, and assisting them in finding alternative ways of interacting.

The standard protocol for IBCT therapy is described in a treatment manual written for therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.S. &amp; Christensen, A. (1996) ''Acceptance and change in couple therapy.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; This standard protocol has been used in research on IBCT and includes 4 sessions for the assessment/feedback phase and an additional 20–22 sessions of active treatment. Typically sessions are conducted every week and last just short of an hour. Toward the end of therapy, sessions are often spaced more widely (e.g., every other week or longer). Thus, the typical course of therapy lasts between 6 and 12 months.

==Topics addressed==
While traditional behavioral couples therapy focused heavily on change,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N. S., &amp; Follette, W. C. (1985). Clinical significance of improvement resulting from two behavioral marital therapy components. Behavior Therapy, 16, 249–262.&lt;/ref&gt; integrative couples therapy attempted to balance change and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman and Compton: (2003) From Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy to Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy: New Research Directions ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 17 -25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through helping couples to better understand each other's learning history and to produce more contingency shaped changes in session and less rule governed changes for the couple. This is accomplished through therapist interventions such as turning the problem into something that happens to the couple. Some of the current research suggests that contingency shaped behavior is easier to maintain then rule governed behavior for couples.&lt;ref&gt;Mia Sevier, Kathleen Eldridge, Janice Jones, Brian D Doss, Andrew Christensen (2008). Observed communication and associated satisfaction during traditional and integrative behavioral couples therapy. ''Behavior Therapy, 39(2),'' 137–150&lt;/ref&gt; As to behavioral function, the greater the amount of escape /withdrawal behavior a couples members displays during demand situations the higher the amount of distress.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, K.A., Sevier, M. Jones, J., Atkins, D.C. &amp; Christensen, A. (2007). Demand-withdraw communication in severely distressed couples. Journal of Family Psychology, 21(2), 218–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrative behavioral couples therapy addresses topics such as intimacy in couples relationships&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J. V., &amp; Scott, R. L. (2001). Intimacy: A behavioral interpretation. The Behavior Analyst, 24, 75–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J. (2003).  Behavior Analysis and the Scientific Study of Couples. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (4),'' 412–419 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, R.B. (1998). Updating Behavior Therapy with Couples. ''The Family Journal,'' 6(1), 6–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J.V. (2001). Acceptance in behavior therapy: Understanding the process of change. The Behavior Analyst, 24, 213–226.&lt;/ref&gt;  and  forgiveness in couples.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., Cautilli, J.D., Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-Sabtig, R. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. '' IJBCT, 2.(2),''  192–208 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of researchers are interested in the concept of [[behavioral momentum]] with couples. Couples seem to go through periods of ongoing improvement and other couples seem to go through periods of negative momentum. Theoretically, behaviorism has begun to focus more on romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Lev Dermer (2006): Towards Understanding The Meaning Of Affectionate Verbal Behavior;  Towards Creating Romantic Loving, ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7.(4),''  Page 452 -480 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy compared to traditional behavioral couple therapy==
Integrative behavioral couples therapy seems to work slower in producing change initially but has led to a 71% improvement rate in couples.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Berns S, Wheeler J, Baucom DH, &amp; Simpson LE (2004) Traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy for significantly and chronically distressed married couples. J Consult Clin Psychol.72(2):176-91&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Integrative behavioral couples therapy does not produce as much change as traditional behavioral couples therapy but it does produce more acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Doss BD, Thum YM, Sevier M, Atkins DC, &amp; Christensen, A. (2005). Improving relationships: mechanisms of change in couple therapy. J Consult Clin Psychol. 73(4):624-33&lt;/ref&gt; At two years 69% of the Integrative behavioral couples therapy group appears to be doing better, while only 60% of the traditional group does better, while marital satisfaction was also in greater favor for the integrative behavioral couples therapy group.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Yi J, Baucom DH,  &amp; George WH. (2006). Couple and individual adjustment for 2 years following a randomized clinical trial comparing traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy.J Consult Clin Psychol. 74(6):1180–91&lt;/ref&gt; However, the traditional behavioral couples therapy group had a larger decline in negativity toward each other than did the integrative behavioral couples therapy group.&lt;ref&gt;Sevier M, Eldridge K, Jones J, Doss BD, &amp; Christensen A (2008). Observed communication and associations with satisfaction during traditional and integrative behavioral couple therapy.Behav Ther. 39(2):137-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vs. traditional behavioral couples therapy after an affair==
Overall the state of the research of couples being treated specifically for marital [[infidelity]] is in its infancy. One study,  looked at 19 couples who had an affair. This study found that both traditional behavioral couples therapy and integrative behavioral couples therapy were effective in increasing intmacy after the affair was disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins,, D., Eldridge, K., Baucom, D. &amp; Christensen, A. (2005). Infidelity and behavioral couples therapy: Optimism in the face of betrayal. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 73,'' 144–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested that this is good news for couples. A greater reliance on behavioral conceptualizations of romantic love&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Lev Dermer (2006): Towards Understanding The Meaning Of Affectionate Verbal Behavior;  Towards Creating Romantic Loving. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7.(4),''  Page 452-480&lt;/ref&gt;  [[intimacy]] and [[forgiveness]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, K. &amp; Baucom, D. (1998).

Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. '' IJBCT, 2.(2),''  192–208 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  may be helpful in easing the pain of such difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Baucom, &amp; Snyder, D.K. (2004). An integrative intervention for promoting recovery from an extramarital affair. Journal of Marriage and Family Therapy, 30, 213–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral assessment of couples==

Behavior analysis uses direct observation to determine the areas for intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A.M. (1979). The quantity and quality of marital interaction related to marital satisfaction: A behavioral analysis. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 12, 665–678.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, T.A., Weiss, R.L.&amp; Patterson, G.R.(1974). A behavioral analysis of the determinants of marital satisfaction. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42, 802–811.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) has an annual conference where couple researchers and therapists can present their recent work in the field. The [[ABCT Couples Special Interest Group]] is part of ABCT and is composed of researchers whose focus is intimate relationships or clinicians whose focus is couple therapy.

The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International (ABA:I)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]&lt;/ref&gt; has a special interest group in Behavioral Counseling which has many couples therapists. ABA:I has two conventions per year on in the U.S. and one Internationally. Couples researchers and therapists often present at these conferences.

The World Center for Behavior Analysis offers a certification in behavior therapy that covers Integrative Behavioral Couples Therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcenterba.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718113444/http://worldcenterba.com/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1200">'''Jing''' ({{zh|s=敬|t=敬|p=Jìng}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] which is typically translated as "reverence." It is often used by [[Confucius]] in the term ''gōngjìng'' ({{zh|恭敬}}), meaning "respectful reverence". The Confucian notion of respect has been likened to the later, western [[Immanuel Kant#Moral philosophy|Kantian]] notion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Robin S., "Respect", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/respect/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For Confucians, ''jìng'' requires ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'', or righteousness, and a proper observation of rituals (''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]''). To have ''jìng'' is vitally important in the maintenance of ''[[xiào]]'', or filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;Richey, J. (2005). Confucius, in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

Label Propagation is a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled data points. At the start of the algorithm, a (generally small) subset of the data points have labels (or classifications). These labels are propagated to the unlabeled points throughout the course of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Xiaojin|title=Learning From Labeled and Unlabeled Data With Label Propagation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[complex networks]], real networks tend to have [[community structure]]. Label propagation is an algorithm &lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"&gt;U.N.Raghavan – R. Albert – S. Kumara [https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2938 "Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for finding communities. In comparison with other algorithms&lt;ref&gt;M. E. J. Newman, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/epjb.pdf "Detecting community structure in networks"], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; label propagation has advantages in its running time and amount of a priori information needed about the network structure (no parameter is required to be known beforehand). The disadvantage is that it produces no unique solution, but an aggregate of many solutions.

==Functioning of the Algorithm==

At initial condition, the nodes carry a label that denotes the community they belong to. Membership in a community changes based on the labels that the neighboring nodes possess. This change is subject to the maximum number of labels within one degree of the nodes. Every node is initialized with a unique label, then the labels diffuse through the network. Consequently, densely connected groups reach a common label quickly. When many such dense (consensus) groups are created throughout the network, they continue to expand outwards until it is impossible to do so.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

The process has 5 steps:&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network. For a given node x, C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (0) = x.

2. Set t = 1.

3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to X.

4. For each x ∈ X chosen in that specific order, let C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = f(C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t),C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i(m+1)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1)). f here returns the label occurring with the highest frequency among neighbours.

5. If every node has a label that the maximum number of their neighbours have, then stop the algorithm. Else, set t = t + 1 and go to (3).

==Multiple Community Structure==

In contrast with other algorithms label propagation can result in various community structures from the same initial condition. The range of solutions can be narrowed if some nodes are given preliminary labels while others are held unlabelled. Consequently, unlabelled nodes will be more likely to adapt to the labelled ones. For a more accurate finding of communities, [[Jaccard index|Jaccard’s index]] is used to aggregate multiple community structures, containing all important information.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10092">In [[electromagnetism]], the '''Lorenz gauge condition''' or '''Lorenz gauge''' (sometimes mistakenly called the Lorentz gauge) is a partial [[gauge fixing]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic vector potential]]. The condition is that &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu A^\mu=0.&lt;/math&gt; This does not completely determine the gauge: one can still make a gauge transformation &lt;math&gt;A^\mu\to A^\mu+\partial^\mu f,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[harmonic function|harmonic]] scalar function (that is, a [[scalar function]] satisfying &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\partial^\mu f=0,&lt;/math&gt; the equation of a [[scalar field theory|massless scalar field]]).

The Lorenz condition is used to eliminate the redundant spin-0 component in the {{nowrap|(1/2, 1/2)}} [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]]. It is equally used for massive spin-1 fields where the concept of gauge transformations does not apply at all.

The Lorenz condition is named after [[Ludvig Lorenz]]. It is a [[Lorentz invariant]] condition, and is frequently called the "Lorentz condition" because of confusion with [[Hendrik Lorentz]], after whom Lorentz covariance is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Jackson|first1 = J.D.|author1-link = John David Jackson (physicist)|last2 = Okun|first2 = L.B.|author2-link = Lev Okun|title = Historical roots of gauge invariance|journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume = 73|issue = 3|pages = 663–680|year = 2001|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.73.663|arxiv = hep-ph/0012061|bibcode = 2001RvMP...73..663J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electromagnetism]], the Lorenz condition is generally [[Scientific method|used]] in [[calculation]]s of [[Time-variant system|time-dependent]] [[electromagnetic field]]s through [[retarded potential]]s.&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{Citation |first1=Kirk T. |last1=McDonald|title=The relation between expressions for time-dependent electromagnetic fields given by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1074–1076 |year=1997 |doi=10.1119/1.18723 |bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1074M|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/jefimenko.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu A^\mu \equiv A^\mu{}_{,\mu} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-potential]], the comma denotes a [[partial differentiation]] and the repeated index indicates that the [[Einstein summation convention]] is being used. The condition has the advantage of being [[Lorentz invariant]]. It still leaves substantial gauge degrees of freedom.

In ordinary vector notation and [[SI]] units, the condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{ \vec{A}} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic vector potential]] and &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric potential]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=[[Classical Electrodynamics (book)|Classical Electrodynamics]]|edition=3rd|pages=240|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-30932-X|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v2ck__wFOBEC|title=Quantum Theory of Near-Field Electrodynamics|last=Keller|first=Ole|date=2012-02-02|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642174100|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[gauge fixing]].

In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]] units the condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{\vec{A}} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gbur|first=Gregory J.|title=Mathematical Methods for Optical Physics and Engineering|year=2011|pages=59|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51610-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L7w7UpecbKYC|title=The Quantum Theory of Radiation|last=Heitler|first=Walter|date=1954|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=|isbn=9780486645582|location=|pages=3|language=en|author-link=Walter Heitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quick justification of the Lorenz gauge can be found using [[Maxwell's equations]] and the relation between the magnetic vector potential and the magnetic field:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times -\frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\vec{E} + \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the curl is zero, that means there is a scalar function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla\varphi = \vec{E} + \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the well known equation for the electric field, 

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\nabla \varphi - \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be plugged into another one of Maxwell's equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla \times \vec{B} &amp;= \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \vec{A}\right) \\
 &amp;= \nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \vec{A}\right) - \nabla^2\vec{A} \\
 &amp;= \mu_0\vec{J} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t} \\
 &amp;= \mu_0\vec{J} - \frac{1}{c^2}\nabla\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \vec{A}}{\partial t^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This leaves,

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \vec{A} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}\right) = \mu_0\vec{J} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \vec{A}}{\partial t^2} + \nabla^2\vec{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

To have Lorentz invariance, the time derivatives and spatial derivatives must be treated equally (i.e. of the same order). Therefore, it is convenient to choose the Lorenz gauge condition, which gives the result

:&lt;math&gt;\Box\vec{A} = \left[\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^{2}\right]\vec{A} = \mu_0\vec{J}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar procedure with a focus on the electric scalar potential and making the same gauge choice will yield

:&lt;math&gt;\Box\varphi = \left[\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2\right] \varphi = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\rho .&lt;/math&gt;

These are simpler and more symmetric forms of the inhomogeneous [[Maxwell's equations]]. Note that the [[Coulomb gauge]] also fixes the problem of Lorentz invariance, but leaves a coupling term with first-order derivatives.

Here 

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}&lt;/math&gt; 

is the vacuum velocity of light, and &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is the [[d'Alembertian]] operator. These equations are not only valid under vacuum conditions, but also in polarized media,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, M.V.Cheremisin "Riemann-Silberstein representation of the complete Maxwell equations set", http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0310036, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{J}&lt;/math&gt; are source density and circulation density, respectively, of the electromagnetic induction fields &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; calculated as usual from &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; by the equations 

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\nabla\varphi - \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{B} = \nabla\times \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; 

The explicit solutions for &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; – unique, if all quantities vanish sufficiently fast at infinity – are known as [[retarded potential]]s.

==History==
When originally published, Lorenz's work was not received well by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Maxwell had eliminated the Coulomb electrostatic force from his derivation of the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] since he was working in what would nowadays be termed the [[Coulomb gauge]]. The Lorenz gauge hence contradicted Maxwell's original derivation of the EM wave equation by introducing a retardation effect to the Coulomb force and bringing it inside the EM wave equation alongside the time varying [[electric field]], which was introduced in Lorenz's paper "On the identity of the vibrations of light with electrical currents". Lorenz's work was the first [[symmetry|symmetrizing]] shortening of Maxwell's equations after Maxwell himself published his 1865 paper. In 1888, retarded potentials came into general use after [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]]'s experiments on [[electromagnetic wave]]s. In 1895, a further boost to the theory of retarded potentials came after [[J. J. Thomson]]'s interpretation of data for [[electron]]s (after which investigation into [[electrical phenomena]] changed from time-dependent [[electric charge]] and [[electric current]] distributions over to moving [[point charge]]s).&lt;ref name="mcdonald"/&gt;

'''''Making Europe Unconquerable''''' is a book about how [[civilian-based defense]] can be incorporated into the foundations of European defense and collective security. Written by [[Gene Sharp]], the book was originally published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. Its subtitle was ''the potential of civilian-based deterrence and defense''. The book was reviewed in major newspapers,&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer86/&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name=taylor87/&gt; and professional journals.&lt;ref name=pierre86/&gt;&lt;ref name=harbottle8687/&gt;&lt;ref name=thee86/&gt; Although it advocated a significant departure from existing defense policies, it received a favorable review from [[George F. Kennan]], widely perceived as one of the major architects of the US approach to the [[cold war]]. Later in the same year, the book was republished with a foreword from [[George F. Kennan|Kennan]]. It has also been published in Dutch and Italian editions.

==Topics covered==
In its opening pages, ''Making Europe Unconquerable'' states that 
{{Quote | This book is mostly about... ‘[[Civilian-based defense|civilian-based defence]]’... In this policy, the whole population and the society's institutions become the fighting forces.  Their weaponry consists of a vast variety of forms of psychological, economic, social, and political resistance and counter-attack...  to deny the attackers their objectives and to make consolidation of political control impossible. These aims would be achieved by applying massive  and selective noncooperation and defiance [and seeking] to create maximum international problems for the attackers and to subvert the reliability of their troops and functionaires. | pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3}}
''Making Europe Unconquerable'' contains 7 chapters entitled
# Meeting Europe's defense needs
# [[Civilian-based defense]] for Western Europe?
# [[Transarmament]]
# Preventing attack
# In face of attack
# Defeating attack
# Assessing the potential
The book also contains a bibliography (12 pages) and an index (24 pages).

{{Gene Sharp}}In the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[George F. Kennan]], widely viewed as a major architect of the US approach to the [[cold war]], wrote that Sharp's "primary purpose in writing the book was... 'to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.' And for this, he makes a reasonably good case."&lt;ref name= kennan86 /&gt; Kennan stated that "the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it." Kennan viewed Sharp's approach as requiring
{{Quote | a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, ‘a crucial insight into the nature of power’—namely, that ‘all political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight’&lt;ref name=kennan86 /&gt;}}
Kennan wondered "whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so,"&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt; and advised that Sharp
{{Quote | must not expect... that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going...  It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;}}

In the ''New York Times'', [[Karl E. Meyer]] described the book as "reflective," and stated that  "there is considerable merit to &lt;nowiki&gt;[Sharp's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; contention that 'all peoples can with effort make themselves politically indigestable to would-be tyrants.'"&lt;ref name= meyer86/&gt; Meyer also argued that Sharp's approach "has its flaws...  If the stakes are deemed sufficiently vital, civilian resistance seems unlikely to dissuade a determined aggressor."&lt;ref name= meyer86 /&gt;

In ''Foreign Affairs'', Andrew Pierre wrote that 
{{Quote | The value of this thoughtful work is in the alternative it suggests: ‘civilian defense’ through advance training for such actions against an intruder as mass public demonstrations, boycotts and strikes, demoralization of enemy troops, and the like. | pp. 872–73&lt;ref name= pierre86 /&gt;}}
He added that "The author's proposals go against the grain of mainstream thinking, and to this reviewer leave many questions unanswered, but they are carefully put forward in a nonpolemical manner and clearly merit sustained attention and thought" (p.&amp;nbsp;873&lt;ref name=pierre86 /&gt;).

''[[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]]'', himself a former designer of nuclear weapons, reviewed the book in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''. He quoted Einstein:
{{Quote | ‘The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.’  Although Albert Einstein's admonition has been quoted innumerable times, it has not, with few exceptions, led to deep and persistent thought about alternatives...  One of these exceptions is in the writings of Gene Sharp about what he calls ‘civilian-based defense’...  Making Europe Unconquerable is especially timely. (p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;}}
He added that "The side effects of pursuing a civilian-based defense strategy are especially interesting, since they tend to be beneficial in peacetime. This is a book that should be read attentively by anyone seriously searching for new ways of thinking about how we can stop our "drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." (p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9350">A '''mash-up novel''' (also called "'''mashup'''" or "'''mashed-up novel'''"), is a work of fiction which combines a pre-existing literature text, often a classic work of fiction, with another genre, usually [[Horror fiction|horror genre]], into a single narrative. Marjorie Kehe of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' renders this admixture of classic text as "somewhere between 60 and 85 percent original text, with new plot twists added by contemporary co-authors".&lt;ref name=CSM0115&gt;{{cite web|last=Kehe|first=Marjorie|title= 'Android Karenina': no end in sight to mash-up novels|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2010/0115/Android-Karenina-no-end-in-sight-to-mash-up-novels|work=Chapter &amp; Verse|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "twists" often include horror fiction elements like [[Vampire fiction|vampires]], [[Werewolf fiction|werewolves]] or [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]].

April 13, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears to have first been coined in a review of  [[Seth Grahame-Smith|Seth Grahame-Smith's]] 2009 novel, ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]''. Initially calling it a 'parody' and 'literary hybrid', Caroline Kellogg, lead blogger for ''Jacket Copy'', [[The New York Times|''The LA Times'']]' book blog, later describes the work as "novel-as-mashup".&lt;ref name=JC4409&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|title='Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' by Seth Grahame-Smith: The undead meet Jane Austen in L.A. author's horror mashup.|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-zombies4-2009apr04,0,4685367.story|work=Jacket Copy|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the popularity of the novel grew and a bidding war commenced over the [[film rights]] to the book, the term spread. Subsequent mash-up novels include [[Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters|''Sense and Sensibility and Seamonsters'']], "Little Women and Werewolves" and [[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|''Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter'']] (also by Grahame-Smith), the last of which was adapted into a film [[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (film)|of the same name]].

Prior to publication, the artwork cover for "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" depicting a "zombified" [[Regency romance|Regency]] portrait of Marcia Fox by [[Sir William Beechey]] altered by [[Quirk Books]] artist Doogie Horner to show her lower face eroded, exposing bone and viscera caught the attention of bloggers,&lt;ref name="JC4409"/&gt; as did the opening line of the novel: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains." This is a parody of Austen's original line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

== As a genre ==
While most works in mash-up genre rely on fictional texts as their basis, other works like ''Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter'' superimpose the same sort of contrasting genre upon historical figures and events. A more recent phenomenon within the genre is the combination of more than two original works, or genres, as in the case of ''Robinson Crusoe (The Eerie Adventures of the Lycanthrope)'', which combines the [[Robinson Crusoe|original novel]] with elements borrowed from the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] as well as the popular genre of [[werewolf fiction]], and is accordingly attributed to three authors – [[Daniel Defoe]], H.P. Lovecraft, and Peter Clines.&lt;ref&gt;Clines, Peter, Daniel Defoe, and H. P. Lovecraft. ''The Eerie Adventures of the Lycanthrope Robinson Crusoe''. {{ISBN|978-1934861523}}.  Permuted Press, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exemplars ==
As previously noted, the novel ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' combines [[Jane Austen|Jane Austen's]] classic 1813 novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' with elements of modern [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] fiction, crediting Austen as co-author. It was first published in April 2009 by [[Quirk Books]] and in October 2009 a Deluxe Edition was released, containing full-color images and additional zombie scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33926/pride-prejudice-zombies-deluxe-edition-now-available |title=Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies Deluxe Edition Available Soon |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier novel, ''[[Move Under Ground]]'' by [[Nick Mamatas]] was a 2004 novel combining the [[beat generation|Beat]] style of [[Jack Kerouac]] with the [[cosmic horror]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]].

== Copyright issues ==
Mashup novels constitute [[derivative work]]s since they include major elements borrowed from an original, previously created work. Most authors of such novels, however, avoid potential legal issues (and the payment of royalties to the original writers) by basing their books on texts that are in the [[public domain]]. One notable exception is ''The Late Gatsby'', which combines [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' with a vampire narrative – since the original text is still protected by the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] (until 2020) in the United States, the book was published outside the U.S. and remains unavailable to its residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Late-Gatsby-ebook/dp/B008U17O7S/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_1 The Late Gatsby]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
While initially well-received (''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' spent eight months on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and ''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'' has already been made into a feature film), at least one reviewer has suggested that the genre has run its course in popularity. Jennifer Schuessler, of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reflects the pessimism of critics of the genre:

{{cquote|Publishers in search of a marketing hook aren't above trumpeting even their most middling wares as a mix of Dickens, Chekhov and Dan Brown. This year, a small publishing house in Philadelphia hit on a more effective formula: Take some Jane Austen, add a healthy dollop of gore and start counting the money.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT121309&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Undead-Austen Mash-Ups|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E3DC1E39F930A25751C1A96F9C8B63 |department=Book Reviews|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}

'''Meeting of the minds''' (also referred to as '''mutual agreement''', '''mutual assent''' or '''''consensus ad idem''''') is a phrase in [[Contract|contract law]] used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/08/what-is-offer-or-proposal-under.html What is an Offer or proposal under the Contract Law?], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Covenant (law)|condition]] or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a [[contract]] in some jurisdictions.

== History ==
Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of 'meeting of minds' may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term ''consensus ad idem'', which actually means 'agreement to the [same] thing'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; There must be [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] that the parties had each, from an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their [[wiktionary:assent|assent]], and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Lord Steyn, 'Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 LQR 433; c.f. § 133 BGB in Germany, where "the actual will of the contracting party, not the literal sense of words, is to be determined"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept in academic work==
{{Contract law}}
German jurist, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] is usually credited with developing the [[will theory of contract]] in his work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''[http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]'', 8 vols. (Berlin: Veit, 1840–9) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] is one person known for expounding the idea of a contract based on a meeting of minds, at which time it gained much support in the courts.

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction.

{{cquote|In the law of contract the use of moral phraseology led to equal confusion, as I have shown in part already, but only in part. Morals deal with the actual internal state of the individual's mind, what he actually intends. From the time of the Romans down to now, this mode of dealing has affected the language of the law as to contract, and the language used has reacted upon the thought. We talk about a contract as a meeting of the minds of the parties, and thence it is inferred in various cases that there is no contract because their minds have not met; that is, because they have intended different things or because one party has not known of the assent of the other. Yet nothing is more certain than that parties may be bound by a contract to things which neither of them intended, and when one does not know of the other's assent. Suppose a contract is executed in due form and in writing to deliver a lecture, mentioning no time. One of the parties thinks that the promise will be construed to mean at once, within a week. The other thinks that it means when he is ready. The court says that it means within a reasonable time. The parties are bound by the contract as it is interpreted by the court, yet neither of them meant what the court declares that they have said. In my opinion no one will understand the true theory of contract or be able even to discuss some fundamental questions intelligently until he has understood that all contracts are formal, that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs — not on the parties' having meant the same thing but on their having said the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., [http://www.constitution.org/lrev/owh/path_law.htm 'The Path of the Law'] (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a ''consensus ad idem'' ("agreement to the same [thing]") which is an undoubted requirement of [[synallagmatic contracting]], and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, 'Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All' (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in case law==
In ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216, [[Thesiger LJ]] said, in the course of a judgment on the [[postal rule]],

{{cquote|Now, whatever in abstract discussion may be said as to the legal notion of its being necessary, in order to the effecting of a valid and binding contract, that the minds of the parties should be brought together at one and the same moment, that notion is practically the foundation of [[English law]] upon the subject of the formation of contracts. Unless therefore a contract constituted by correspondence is absolutely concluded at the moment that the continuing offer is accepted by the person to whom the offer is addressed, it is difficult to see how the two minds are ever to be brought together at one and the same moment...&lt;ref&gt;Thesiger LJ then refers to ''[[Adams v. Lindsell]]'' as supporting this proposition.&lt;/ref&gt; But on the other hand it is a principle of law, as well established as the legal notion to which I have referred, that the minds of the two parties must be brought together by mutual communication. An acceptance, which only remains in the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication communicated to the offerer, is no binding acceptance.}}

In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, [[Bowen LJ]] said,

{{cquote|One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary according to the English law - I say nothing about the laws of other countries - to make a contract.}}

In ''[[Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States]]'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;261 U.S. 592, 597, 58 Ct.Cl. 709, 43 S.Ct. 425, 67 L.Ed. 816  (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] said an [[implied in fact contract]] is,

{{cquote|an agreement ...  founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express  contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light  of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.}}

The [[reasoning]] is that a party should not be held to a [[contract]] that they were not even aware existed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A mutual [[promise]] between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where [[legal remedy|legal remedies]] are to be used.  Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a [[moral obligation|moral]] one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a ''legal obligation'' is there a meeting of the minds.

However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party's subjective understanding of the terms, but on "objective indicators," based on what each party said and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Texas Contract law | url = http://www.gaddywells.com/TEXAS_CONTRACT_LAW.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ward v. Williams, Court of Appeals of Arkansas | url = http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032945/http://courts.arkansas.gov/opinions/2002b/20021204/ca011209.html | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the '''formalist theory of contract''', every contract must have six elements: [[Offer and acceptance#Offer|offer]], [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]], [[consideration]], ''meeting of the minds'', [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and [[legality]].  Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called '''form'''.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Vices of consent==
Mutual assent is vitiated by actions such as [[fraud]], [[undue influence]], [[duress]] (see [[per minas]]), [[mutual mistake]], or [[misrepresentation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This may render a contract [[Void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]].

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
On April 10, 2007, the [[National Football League]] introduced a new '''conduct policy''' to help control off-field behavior by its players and preserve the league's public image.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-new-conduct-policy_N.htm?csp=34 Goodell strengthens NFL player conduct policy] ''USA Today'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, introduced by NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], implements a tougher, new personal-conduct policy, and under conditions of the previous policy handed down two of the harshest suspensions in NFL history for off-field misdeeds.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"&gt;Bell, Jarrett. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-pacman-henry-suspensions_N.htm Conduct unbecoming: NFL sets new standard with suspensions] ''USA Today'', April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Each player that has been suspended must reapply for reinstatement.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"&gt;[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=playerconduct&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns CB Jones suspended for 2007 season, WR Henry banned eight games] ''Yahoo Sports Ticker'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy only applies to the player's personal lives and image in the public spotlight. The NFL conducts separate investigations for drug and alcohol abuse and performance enhancement.

As of December 2011, seven players have been suspended for an extended period by the NFL due to conduct off the field.

We hold ourselves to higher standards of responsible conduct because of what it means to be part of the National Football League.

We will continue to review the policy and modify it as warranted."

On September 1, 2006, just days prior to the start of the [[2006 NFL season]], [[Roger Goodell]] assumed the office of Commissioner of the National Football League. Goodell was met with expectations of enforcing the National Football League's image to the media. In the months leading up to Goodell's ascension, nine players from the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"&gt;Wilner, Barry. (Associated Press) [http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2007/04/10/goodell_gets_tough_protects_nfl_brand/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+Sports+%2F+Football+%2F+New+England+Patriots Goodell gets tough, protects NFL brand] ''Boston Globe'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell and the [[National Football League Players Association]] decided that teams will be responsible for the conduct of their employees, and will be subject to discipline for any transgressions.

Goodell had consulted with [[Gene Upshaw]], former executive director of the NFLPA, and also created a six-man player advisory committee to discuss conduct, discipline and other topics.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

The first (players) to feel the teeth of the new policy were [[Tennessee Titans]] [[cornerback]] [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] [[wide receiver]] [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], college teammates at [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] whose first two years in the NFL were marred by arrests.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"/&gt; The third player suspended was [[Chicago Bears]] [[defensive tackle]] [[Tank Johnson]]. On August 24, 2007, [[Atlanta Falcons]] starting [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]] filed a [[plea agreement]] and pleaded guilty in his involvement in illegal dog fighting and [[euthanasia|euthanization]], and was suspended indefinitely without pay; his reinstatement occurred in time for him to play in the 2009-2010 season.

===Adam "Pacman" Jones===
{{details|Adam Jones (American football)#Las Vegas shooting case and suspension}}
Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, facing felony charges in two states, was suspended for the entire 2007 season and given specific conditions to meet before he is reinstated, and he can be reinstated after the Titans' eleventh game.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; There were 10 occasions in which Jones was interviewed by police, the most recent during the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star weekend]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Police there recommended felony and misdemeanor charges against Jones after a fight and shooting at, what Jones refers to as a "strip club", left one man paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Jones later appealed his suspension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/10119161 NFL Suspends Pacman Jones, Bengals' Henry] ''NFL.com'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; saying he was "just being rebellious", but withdrew the request just weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/06/12/bc.fbn.pacmansuspension.ap/index.html Pacman Jones drops appeal], ''Sports Illustrated'', June 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2007, the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] District Attorney's office announced that Jones will face two felony charges stemming from the strip club melee that occurred on February 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2910497 Pacman faces felony charges in shooting that paralyzed man] ''ESPN.com'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the charges have since been dropped, Jones still faces civil actions, and his reinstatement was not to be considered until after the [[2008 Pro Bowl]].

In April 2008, the Bengals released Henry after he was charged with misdemeanor and criminal damaging. He was accused of punching an 18-year-old male in the face and breaking a window in the individual's car. A warrant for Henry's arrest was issued and he surrendered the following day, a police spokesman said.&lt;ref name="Bengals cut Henry"/&gt; In August 2008, the Bengals re-signed Henry. On December 17, 2009, Henry died from injuries sustained from an accident stemming from a [[domestic dispute]] between him and his fiancee.

===Tank Johnson===

On April 30, Terry "Tank" Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge as part of an arrangement with prosecutors that will keep him from serving additional jail time. He was sentenced to 45 days in jail, which was served concurrently with a four-month sentence he was already serving in the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Jail for violating his probation; to donate $2,500 to the [[Gurnee, Illinois]] Police Department and $2,500 to the Gurnee Exchange Club's [[child abuse]] prevention program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_120134804.html Tank Johnson Pleads Guilty, Avoids More Jail Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513214729/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_120134804.html |date=May 13, 2007 }} CBS2 Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, Johnson was pulled over [[speeding]] in [[Arizona]]. According to the police, he was stopped by the police after traveling at forty miles per hour in a twenty-five-mile per hour zone. He was later suspected of drinking, but was released without being booked or charged.

On June 25, 2007, Johnson was released from his contract by the Chicago Bears as a result of the June 22 incident. Bears [[General manager]] [[Jerry Angelo]] stated that he had "no room for error left."

===Michael Vick===
{{details|topic=Michael Vick's involvement in dog fighting|Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation}}

Beginning on April 25, 2007, a large house and surrounding {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property Michael Vick owned in rural [[Surry County, Virginia]] where his 26-year-old cousin Davon T. Boddie had been residing became part of a continuing police investigation for possible operation of an illegal [[dog fighting]] ring. The action came after police executed a [[search warrant]] following two narcotics arrests of Boddie within a week in the [[Virginia Peninsula]] cities of Newport News and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] (each about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away from the Surry County property) earlier in April. Boddie had given the address of Vick's property in Surry County as his home address when arrested. Earlier, in February 2007, Boddie was convicted in the [[Norfolk, Virginia|City of Norfolk]] of disorderly conduct. At that time, he was carrying a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] driver's license giving his address as a house in [[Duluth, Georgia]] which was once owned by Vick.&lt;ref name="Involvement"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Greg Moore |title=If Vick Is Involved, How Many Others Are With Him? |publisher=BlackAthlete Sports Network |date=May 30, 2007 |url=http://www.blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |accessdate=July 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603140222/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |archivedate=June 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ESPN]], during the April 25 narcotics-related search of Vick's home and property at 1915 Moonlight Drive in the southeastern portion of Surry County, police discovered a large number of animals, and evidence which they felt indicated dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Progressing"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Associated Press |title=Prosecutor says dog fighting investigation at Vick's property 'moving forward' |publisher=ESPN |date=May 25, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2883048 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called animal-control officers, who saw what they said was evidence that dogfights had taken place there.

Vick, along with three others, was indicted by a federal grand jury on July 17, 2007 for "conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture".&lt;ref name="indictmentespn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2940065|title=Falcons' Vick indicted by grand jury in dogfighting probe|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2007|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/sportsline/main3067633.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Michael Vick Indicted By Grand Jury | date=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four face $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the federal charges. The operation was based at Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property near [[Smithfield, Virginia]], valued at over $700,000, which could conceivably be forfeited to the government, as the indictment also puts them on notice that the government intends to take possession of property used in the illegal operations and any proceeds.

In late April 2007, Vick denied his involvement and told ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' "I'm never at the house...I left the house with my family...They just haven't been doing the right thing... It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on."&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"/&gt;

Vick appeared in court on July 26, 2007 and pleaded [[innocence|not guilty]], the same date that the Atlanta Falcons began [[NFL Training Camp|training camp]].&lt;ref name="Vick indicted"&gt;Weir, Tom.

===Ben Roethlisberger===
{{details|Ben Roethlisberger#Milledgeville, Georgia}}
On July 17, 2009, a civil suit was filed in Washoe County, Nevada District Court accusing [[Ben Roethlisberger]] of sexually assaulting Andrea McNulty, 31, in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in Lake Tahoe for a celebrity golf tournament.

This was the first time in league history a player has been suspended under the personal conduct policy without being charged with a crime.  Roethlisberger and Ezekiel Elliott are the only two players to have been suspended under this policy without being charged with a crime.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On June 26, 2013, Hernandez was taken from his home in handcuffs and into police custody.&lt;ref name=espnboston&gt;{{cite news |title= Aaron Hernandez in police custody |url= http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/9424056/aaron-hernandez-new-england-patriots-taken-police-custody |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |publisher=ESPN|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriots released Hernandez about 90 minutes later, before officially knowing the charges against him.&lt;ref name="patience" /&gt; Their press release stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;A young man was murdered last week and we extend our sympathies to the family and friends who mourn his loss. Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation.

On August 22, 2013, Aaron Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Odin Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Hernandez indicted in death of semi-pro football player|url=http://www.wcvb.com/news/local/boston-south/aaron-hernandez-indicted-in-death-of-semipro-football-player/-/9848842/21576582/-/phv0vaz/-/index.html|publisher=WVCB TV|accessdate=22 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822164420/http://www.wcvb.com/news/local/boston-south/aaron-hernandez-indicted-in-death-of-semipro-football-player/-/9848842/21576582/-/phv0vaz/-/index.html|archivedate=August 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, Hernandez was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. He was held without bail, but reserved the right to request bail later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hernandez pleads not guilty to murder indictment|url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/06/hernandez-pleads-not-guilty-to-murder-indictment/|publisher=NY Post|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder, as well as five weapon charges, automatically being sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

While on trial for Lloyd's murder, Hernandez was indicted for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado; he was acquitted of the double homicide after a 2017 trial. Five days after the acquittal, Hernandez was found dead in his cell by hanging, which was ruled a suicide. Due to the fact that his death occurred while the murder conviction was under appeal, the conviction was vacated.·§

===Daryl Washington===

====Banned substance abuse====
On April 3, 2013, the NFL announced that [[Daryl Washington]] would be suspended for the first four games of the {{NFL Year|2013}} season for violating the league's substance policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000157077/article/daryl-washington-suspended-for-four-games-by-nfl|title=Daryl Washington suspended for four games by NFL|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2014, the NFL announced that Washington would be suspended for at least the 2014 season for once again violating the league's substance policy bringing his personal credibility and character into question after his statement from the 2013 violation: "I promise to work even harder and to not let you guys down anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000354739/article/daryl-washington-suspended-for-at-least-one-year|title=Daryl Washington suspended for at least one year|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault====

[[Phoenix Police Department|Phoenix Police]] accuse him of pushing her with two hands, causing her to fall and break her right collarbone. On March 24, 2014, he pleaded guilty to the crime of aggravated assault, a class 6 felony. Washington was sentenced to one-year of supervised probation on April 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USAToday.com|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2014/04/23/daryl-washington-arizona-probation-assualt/8057881/|title=Cardinals' Daryl Washington pleads guilty to assault, faces NFL penalty|first=Danika|last=Worthington|accessdate=2014-05-28|date=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Dwyer===
On Wednesday September 17, 2014 [[Jonathan Dwyer]] was arrested because of two incidents at Dwyer's home in southeast Phoenix on July 21 at 8 a.m. and July 22 at 4 p.m., according to the Phoenix Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11544985/jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-arrested-two-counts-suspicion-aggravated-assault&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents concerned attacks against his wife and 18-month-old child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Cardinals player formally charged in domestic violence case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/justice/jonathan-dwyer-indictment/|website=CNN Justice|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwyer was booked into Maricopa County Jail on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault. He was freed the next morning on a $25,000 cash bond and ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device. He was also banned from any contact with the alleged victims, travels outside of Arizona and any involvement with weapons, drugs or alcohol.

Dwyer admitted to the incidents during interviews with detectives but denied physically assaulting his wife and baby son.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/17/us/nfl-jonathan-dwyer-alleged-domestic-violence/&lt;/ref&gt; According to police, a search warrant was executed at his home.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11547511/police-report-says-jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-head-butted-punched-wife-struck-young-son-shoe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martavis Bryant===
Before the start of the [[2015 NFL season]], [[Martavis Bryant]] was suspended for four games in August for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He would return and play the rest of the season with the [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]. During the suspension, he spent time in rehab in [[Houston, TX|Houston]]. Bryant was charged with violating the substance abuse policy again, and suspended, this time for the entire [[2016 NFL season]].

===Ezekiel Elliott===
On August 11, 2017, the NFL suspended [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[running back]] [[Ezekiel Elliott]] for the first six games of the 2017 season, despite the lead NFL investigator in the case reportedly recommending no suspension. His suspension stems from various off the field incidents including being accused of [[domestic violence]] in 2016 by his ex-girlfriend who claimed on five different occasions he assaulted her. Despite never being charged, the NFL launched a year long investigation into the allegations. In March 2017, Elliott was captured on video pulling down woman's shirt exposing her breasts while watching a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade in Dallas. Four months later in July 2017 he was allegedly involved in an altercation at a nightclub during which a DJ’s nose was broken. Dallas police eventually suspended the investigation after they were unable to locate the victim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20302469/ezekiel-elliott-dallas-cowboys-suspended-six-games|title=Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott suspended six games for conduct|last=Archer|first=Todd|publisher=''ESPN.com''|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL Domestic Violence Policy==
A Domestic Violence Policy has been put into effect after the Ray Rice domestic violence incident on August 28, 2014. Commissioner Roger Goodell has lengthen bans to six games for the first domestic violence incident and a lifetime ban for a second incident. This is after the NFL suspended Ray Rice for two games and receiving large amounts of criticism during the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almasy|first1=Steve|last2=Nichols|first2=Rachel|title=NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/28/us/nfl-domestic-violence/|website=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has a history of inconsistently punishing domestic violence amongst its players. A majority of domestic violence violations are punished with about a 1.5 game suspension. The NFL rather has a consistent policy for punishing drug violations with performance-enhancing drugs and substance abuses averaging about 4 games suspension for the first offense and about 8 games suspension of performance-enhancing drugs and a 16 games suspension for substance abuse for a second offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCann|first1=Allison|title=The NFL’s Uneven History Of Punishing Domestic Violence|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has released a new Personal Conduct Policy on December 10, 2014. It is an updated version of the 2007 Personal Conduct Policy. It has added more infractions to the 2007 policy, which include violence against others and domestic violence. The disciplinary process is more detailed in terms of its investigative progress and consequences for infractions than its 2007 counterpart. The new policy will include counseling and treatment services for the offender and their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Rita|title=NFL's Personal Conduct Policy: A Step in the Right Direction|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rita-smith/nfls-personal-conduct-pol_1_b_6326480.html|publisher=huffingtonpost|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the domestic violence policy, the NFL will be educating high school students about domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Lindsay H.|title=NFL extending education about domestic violence to high school level|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/12/05/nfl-extending-education-about-domestic-violence-to-high-school-level/19955467/|publisher=USA TODAY|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person inside the NFL that is in charge on working on domestic violence and sexual assault issues is Anna Isaacson, who Roger Goodell named the first vice president of social responsibility on September 15, 2014. She has created new training sessions for every player and league employee as well as convincing the NFL to put in $10 million for domestic violence advertisements. She also constructed a partnership between the NFL and the National Domestic Violence Hotline to fund more resources to the various call centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drehs|first1=Wayne|title=Can Anna Isaacson save the NFL?|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/hotread141105/new-vp-social-responsibility-anna-isaacson-tries-save-nfl|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==

===Praise===
The new policy has been praised by both NFL players and sports columnists as a necessity to help improve the National Football League's image. The new policy—which also applies to coaches and front office personnel and has the support of NFLPA director Gene Upshaw—prompted questions and strong reactions among players.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;
Teammates of Chris Henry, including safety Madieu Williams, approved of the measure.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

[[Oakland Raiders]] defensive tackle [[Warren Sapp]] stated, "I understand what they're doing. Some of these new-jack kids act like they're walking on water. Sometimes, they need to be slapped in the face to wake up."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

[[New England Patriots]] owner [[Robert Kraft]] said of the policy, "I hope this sends a message to people in our league for how to conduct themselves. We have to be careful. People in America can't relate to overindulged athletes not acting responsibly."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

===Criticism===
{{cquote|''I hope it doesn't backfire. What happens if a coach, GM or owner gets a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]? Then what? What if an ex-NFL player throws himself through a window in [[Miami]]? That still reflects on the NFL's image.''&lt;br&gt;- [[Keyshawn Johnson]], former NFL wide receiver, and current NFL broadcaster.}}

Many considered the suspensions on Jones and Henry to be too harsh, especially Jones', which was enforced despite Jones having not been convicted of any crime. {{Who|date=December 2009}} Criticism was also drawn at the commissioner's ability to punish the rest of the player's team and revoke draft picks.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Goodell's actions are also leaving the league vulnerable to legal action from player's lawyers.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

When New England Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and his staff were [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|accused of illegally videotaping]] the [[New York Jets]]' defensive playcalling signals in September 2007, Belichick was not suspended, but instead fined $500,000. The team was penalized a [[2008 NFL Draft|first round draft pick in 2008]] as they qualified for the playoffs with a perfect 16–0 record, but would have been penalized with a second and third round pick had they failed to make the playoffs. (The Patriots still ended up with the [[New Orleans Saints]]' first-round pick in a trade, selecting [[Jerod Mayo]] with the pick.) The move was heavily criticized as being a [[double standard]].&lt;ref name="impression"/&gt; Although the videotaping is not considered to violate personal conduct rules, NFL players, including [[Cincinnati Bengals]] quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] were critical of Commissioner Goodell's move.&lt;ref name="impression"&gt;Covitz, Randy. [http://www.kansascity.com/sports/story/281362.html NFL gives impression of double standard with Belichick treatment] ''Kansas City Star'', September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Goodell penalized Belichick, he determined that the use of the camera during the Patriots’ season-opening 38-14 win over the New York Jets had no impact on the game.&lt;ref name="impression" /&gt;

'''Negative equity''' occurs when the value of an asset used to secure a loan is less than the outstanding balance on the loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13145239 America's foreclosure plan: Can’t pay or won’t pay?], Paragraph 5, ''[[The Economist]]'' (February 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, assets (particularly [[real estate]], whose loans are [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]]) with negative equity are often referred to as being "'''underwater'''", and loans and borrowers with negative equity are said to be "'''upside down'''". 

People and companies alike may have negative equity, as reflected on their [[balance sheet]]s.

== In an asset ==

In the owner-occupied [[real estate economics|housing market]], a fall in the [[market value]] of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] house or apartment/flat is the usual cause of negative equity. It may occur when the property owner obtains second-mortgage home-equity loans, causing the combined loans to exceed the home value, or simply because the original mortgage was too generous. If the borrower defaults, [[repossession]] and sale of the property by the lender will not raise enough cash to repay the amount outstanding, and the borrower will still be in [[debt]] as well as having lost the property. Some US states like [[California]] require lenders to choose between going after the borrower or taking repossession, but not both.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term negative equity was widely used in the [[United Kingdom]] during the economic recession between 1991 and 1996, and in [[Hong Kong]] between 1998 and 2003. These recessions led to increased unemployment and a decline in property prices, which in turn led to an increase in [[repossession]]s by banks and [[Building society|building societies]] of properties worth less than the outstanding debt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

It is also common for negative equity to occur when the value of a property drops shortly after its purchase. This occurs frequently in automobile loans, where the market value of a car might drop by 20-30% as soon as the car is driven off the lot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

While typically a result of fluctuating asset prices, negative equity can occur when the value of the asset stays fixed and the loan balance increases because loan payments are less than the interest, a situation known as [[negative amortization]]. The typical assets securing such loans are [[real property]] – commercial, office or residential. When the loan is [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]], the lender can only look to the security, that is, the value of the property, when the borrower fails to repay the loan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Since 2007, those most exposed to negative equity are borrowers who obtained loans of a high percentage of the property value (such as 90% or even 100%). These were commonly available before the [[credit crunch]]. Such cases are of course the most at risk from falls in property value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Negative net worth ==
A person who has negative equity can be said to have "negative net worth", where the person's liabilities exceed their assets. One might come to have negative equity as a result of taking out a substantial, unsecured loan. For example, one might use a [[student loan]] to pursue higher education. Although education increases the likelihood of higher future earnings, potential alone is not a financial asset. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the United States, [[student loans]] are rarely dischargeable in [[bankruptcy]], and typically lenders provide student loans without requiring security. This stands in contrast to lenders requiring borrowers to have an equity stake in a comparably-sized real estate loan, as described above, secured by both a down payment and a mortgage. An explanation for the willingness of creditors to provide unsecured student loans is that, in a practical sense, American student loans are secured by the borrower's future earnings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23874">The '''New Qing History''' is a [[school of thought]] that gained prominence in the United States in the mid-1990s by offering a wide-ranging [[Historical revisionism|revision of history]] of the Manchu [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grace Yen Shen, ''Unearthing the Nation: Modern Geology and Nationalism in Republican China'', (University of California Press, 2014), 200 note4.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier historians had emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to “[[sinicization|sinicize]]” their conquerors, that is, to assimilate and make them Chinese in their thought and institutions. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began to learn Manchu and took advantage of newly opened [[Chinese language|Chinese]]- and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]-language archives. This research found that the Manchu rulers were savvy in manipulating their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as they did [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. According to some scholars, at the height of their power, the Qing regarded "China" as only a part, although a very important part, of [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|a much wider empire that extended into]] the [[Inner Asia]]n territories of [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] (today sometimes called [[Manchuria]]) and [[Xinjiang]], or Chinese (Eastern) Turkestan.{{sfnb|Waley-Cohen|2004| p = 194-197}}

Some scholars criticize the approach for exaggerating the Manchu character of the dynasty, and some in China accuse the American historians in the group of imposing American concerns with race and identity or even of imperialist misunderstanding to weaken China. Still others in China agree that this scholarship has opened new vistas for the study of Qing history.{{sfnb|Ding|2009| p = [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/CSH0009-4633430208#.VO0CxfnF-7s ]}}

The use of "New Qing History" as an approach is to be distinguished from the ''New Qing History'', a multi-volume history of the Qing dynasty that was authorized by the [[Chinese State Council]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Mao |first1 = Liping |last2 = Zhao |first2 =Ma  |title ="Writing History in the Digital Age": The New Qing History Project and the Digitization of Qing Archives |journal =History Compass |volume =10 |issue = 5 |pages =367–374 |date =2012 |language = |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1111/j.1478-0542.2012.00841.x |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Prominent scholars who have been associated with the New Qing History, including [[Evelyn Rawski]], [[Mark Elliott (historian)|Mark Elliott]], [[Pamela Kyle Crossley]], [[Laura Hostetler]], Philippe Forêt, and others, despite differing among themselves on important points, represent an "[[Inner Asia]]n" and "[[Eurasia]]n" turn, which conceived the Manchu-centered Qing as fundamentally different from most earlier dynasties but as similar to the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]], [[Mogul empire|Mogul]], and [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Empires across the Eurasian landmass. They argued that the Qing saw itself as a universal empire, a multi-national polity, which with China as only the most central and economically important component. They date the founding of the empire from 1636, when the dynasty was proclaimed, rather than from 1644, when the Qing took control of Beijing. The historians argued that "Manchu" identity was deliberately created only after the takeover of China and that the new racial identity was important but "fungible," easily exchanged for others. The first rulers of the dynasty played the Confucian role of [[Son of Heaven]] but at the same time, often behind the backs of their Han Chinese ministers, adopted other roles to rule other ethnic groups.

The military expansion of frontiers, which Han Chinese ministers often opposed, as it drained resources from China proper, showed that the Qing empire was not only a victim of imperialism but also practiced imperialism itself. Some of the historians followed Evelyn Rawski calling the Qing "Early Modern," rather than "late imperial," on the grounds that the Manchus created a centralized empire that the Ming could not have created.{{sfnb|Rowe|2009| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=KN7Awmzx2PAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20qing%20history%22&amp;f=false 4-10]}}

==Origins==
The origins of the New Qing History lie in Inner Asian Studies. A Harvard scholar, Joseph Fletcher, studied the languages and culture of Central Asia. He was among those to discredit the idea that nearly all Manchu documents were translations from Chinese and that they would add little to the record. He wrote in 1981, "Qing scholars who want to do first-class work in the archives must, from now on, learn Manchu and routinely compare the Manchu and Chinese sources for their topics of research." Beatrice Bartlett, a Yale historian who had studied Manchu with Fletcher, reported in an article, 'Books of Revelations', that the archives in Taiwan and Beijing revealed many secrets, which required knowledge of Manchu.

The [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] of the Yongzheng emperor operated only in Manchu until the 1730s, and many other important edicts and memorials did not have Chinese translations. Official use of the language, she argued, did not decline during the 19th century. She concluded that the archives of Manchu materials were more likely to be complete, as they were less likely to have been raided, weeded or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Both quoted in {{cite book | first = Gertrude | last = Roth Li | title = Manchu: A Textbook for Reading Documents | year = 2010 | publisher = National Foreign Language Resource Center | p =11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bArr1-E5mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Fletcher%20manchu%20language&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 29, 2017| isbn = 9780980045956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History took on distinct form in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Crossley and Rawski summarized the arguments for using Manchu-language materials, materials, which they and others had explored in the newly opened archives in Beijing and were beginning to use in their publications.{{sfnb|CrossleyRawski|1993}} Evelyn Rawski's presidential address, "Re-envisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History," at the annual meeting of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1996, particularly criticized the question of the "sinicization" of the Qing that had been raised by [[Ping-ti Ho]] in his 1967 article "The Significance of the Ch'ing Period in Chinese History." Rawski's thought was based on a Manchu-centric concept of history and indicated that the reason the Qing rulers could successfully govern China for nearly 300 years was not the result of sinicization, adopting the characteristics of Han Chinese rule and culture, but by their focus on retaining the characteristics of Manchu culture. They used such characteristics to strengthen relations with other nationalities to build a multiracial empire that included [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] and other nationalities.{{sfnb|Rawski|1996|}} For better governing his multiethnic empire, for instance, the Kangxi emperor located his summer residence in the [[Chengde Mountain Resort]], north of the Great Wall. That became the historical core of city of [[Chengde]], which the Qianlong emperor enlarged considerably, including a replica of the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Forêt (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Ping-ti Ho published "In Defense of Sinicization: A Rebuttal of Evelyn Rawski's 'Re-envisioning the Qing'". He argued that the pattern of Chinese history was for a [[conquest dynasty]] to adopt Chinese ways of rule and culture and attacked Rawski for Manchu-centrism.{{sfnb|Ho|1998|}}

The school that is now known as the "New Qing History" developed after the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, [http://www.csstoday.com/Item/1243.aspx Beyond the culture: my comments on New Qing history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, historian Huang Pei published a monograph that developed the objections stated by Ho Ping-ti. {{sfnb|Huang|2011|}}

There are differences among the scholars in the loose group. For example, Rawski's ''Re-envisioning the Qing'' and Elliott’s ''The Manchu Way'' regard the Qing as a Manchu empire, with China being only one part. Nevertheless, Pamela Kyle Crossley sees the empire not as a Manchu empire but as a "simultaneous" system in which the rulership is not subordinate to the Chinese or any other single culture. She criticized the "Manchu-centered" school for romanticism and a reliance upon disproved theories about "[[Altaic]]" language and history, but she seems to include herself in the Qing empire school, which she calls "Qing Studies."&lt;ref&gt;"A Reserved View of the New Qing History"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, historian Richard J. Smith reported that an interpretive "middle ground" had emerged between the views of Rawski and Crossley, on one hand, and Ho and Huang, on the other. Smith himself had come to the conclusion that "the Qing empire" and "China" were not the same thing and that the Qing had to be placed in not only a Manchu context but one that included Inner Asia in general and that saw China in a global field. The less "sinocentric" view, Smith continued, which placed less emphasis on "sinicization," had won over most Western scholars on China, in spite of debates over "matters of degree."{{sfnb|Smith|2015| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=RhmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=smith+qing+dynasty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDlMmSqJjQAhXGJCYKHTFfAlQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20qing%20history&amp;f=false ix-xi]}}

==Responses==
The arguments put forward in the New Qing History inspired debate on a number of specific points.

===Dispute over term "China"===
The scholar Zhao Gang responded against the revisionist historians by noting that they claimed that the Qing used only "China" (中國) to encompass only Han people (漢人) and "[[China proper]]" and pointed out that in fact that China proper and Han people were not synonymous with "China" in the Qing view according to Mark Elliott's own work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han dynasty used Zhongguo (中國) to refer only to Han areas, but the Qing dynasty reinvented the definition of Zhongguo (中國) to refer to non-Han areas as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Gang cited Qing documents with Qing being used for the Manchu term Dulimbai Gurun (a direct translation of "中國", Zhongguo; "Middle Kingdom") in Manchu texts and Zhongguo in Chinese texts to refer to the entire Qing including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet as "China", [[Names of the Qing dynasty|in official documents, edicts, treaties]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in texts like the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]],{{sfnp|Zhao|2006|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 8 and 12]}} [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)#Convention of Kyakhta (1768)|Convention of Kyakhta]] (1768),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|1755 pronouncement by the Qianlong Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Manchu language memorial on the conquest of Dzungaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEHtUunnIIvksASBzIEQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun%20land&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;dq=steppes+mountains+rivers+Dzungar+unified+with+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5UHtUuvvCcu_sQStu4HYBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=steppes%20mountains%20rivers%20Dzungar%20unified%20with%20china&amp;f=false Elliott 2001], p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|Qianlong's arguments for the annexation of Xinjiang]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Qianlong's sinicization policies in parts of Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 18, 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Elliott wrote that it was under the Qing that "China" transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the "state claimed sovereignty," rather than only the [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] area and its people by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2658945?seq=36 Elliot 2000], p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Barabantseva has also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as "Chinese" (中國之人), and they used the term Zhongguo (中國) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire but used "Hanren" (漢人) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3XFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Barabantseva 2010], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph W. Esherick]] observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the [[Lifan Yuan]] and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (中國) and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Esherick 2006], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other points===
Scholars have disagreed on whether or how much the Manchu rulers used new forms of imperial ritual to display new forms of empire or continued rituals from the Ming to show that they saw themselves as heirs of a Han Chinese empire. Roger Des Forges' review of [[David M. Robinson]]'s ''Martial Spectacles of the Ming Court'' criticized scholars of conquest dynasties and New Qing History and disagreed with the idea that  the "Royal hunt" was a differing factor between Han Chinese and [[conquest dynasties]]. He noted that the martial themed Ming dynasty [[Grand Review (China)|Grand Review]] was copied by the Qing and disagreed with those who sought to present it as a Qing feature. He praised Robinson in differing from scholars who selected [[History of the Ming dynasty#Universal rulership|certain Ming and Qing emperors]] to contrast their difference and for not conflating Han with "Chinese" and not translating the term "Zhongguo".&lt;ref&gt;Roger des Forges, [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v60p299.pdf (Review)] ''Journal of Chinese Studies'' No. 60 – (January 2015) pp. 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History, according to Tristan G. Brown, writing in 2011, did not explore the example of Islam and Muslims to test their argument that the early Qing emperors aspired to be universal monarchs. Brown finds that an inscription by the Qianlong emperor showed that he wanted to incorporate both Xinjiang and Islam into his empire and that this inscription, along with the "inventive structural duality of Chinese-Islamic architecture with Central Asian Turkish-Islamic architectural forms," makes the "most compelling case" that New Qing History is also applicable to Chinese Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first =Tristan G. |last = Brown | journal = Journal of Chinese Studies| volume =53 |date = July 2011 |title = Towards an Understanding of Qianlong's Conception of Islam: A Study of the Dedication Inscriptions of the Fragrant Concubine's Mosque in the Imperial Capital|url = http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v53p137.pdf |pp = 138, 145| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In the journal ''Chinese Social Sciences Today'', an official publication of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Li Zhiting, a scholar working on the National Qing Dynasty Compilation Committee, charged that "'New Qing History' is academically absurd, and politically does damage to the unity of China...." He sought to "expose its mask of pseudo-academic scholarship, eliminating the deleterious effect it has had on scholarship in China." Li went on to charge that the "whole range of views [New Qing History scholars] express are cliches and stereotypes, little more than dusted off versions in a scholarly tone of the Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism of the 19th century." American scholars such as Evelyn Rawski, Pamela Crossley, Mark Elliott, and James Millward, Li continued, "view the history of China from an imperialist standpoint, with imperialist points of view and imperialist eyes, regarding 'traditional' China as an 'empire,' regarding the Qing dynasty as 'Qing dynasty imperialism.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Li |first = Zhiting 李治亭| title = Scholars Criticize 'New Qing History': An Example of 'New Imperialist' History| journal = Chinese Social Sciences Today| date = April 20, 2015| ref = harv}} translated in {{Cite journal | url = http://cmp.hku.hk/2015/04/22/38664/ | last = | first = |title = A righteous view of history|journal  = China Media Project |date=April 2015| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of NikeGrindLogo.png: low resolution copy of the grind program logo --&gt;

'''Nike Grind''' is part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Reuse-A-Shoe program that was started in 1993. The purpose of the program is to eliminate waste and close the loop on Nike's [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)#Product life cycle (PLC)|product lifecycle]] by collecting post-consumer, non-metal-containing athletic shoes of any brand. This includes Nike shoes that are returned due to material or workmanship defects.

==Recycling Process==
Once collected, the sneakers are ground up and separated into three distinct types of material: [[rubber]] from the outsole, foam from the midsole and fabric from the shoe's upper. Nike and its partners (Atlas Track &amp; Tennis, Playtop, Training Ground, Everlast and [[Rebound Ace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Partners | work=Let Me Play | url= http://www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe/grind/partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; take the granulated rubber and create [[soccer]], [[American football|football]], [[baseball]] fields, [[weight room]] flooring and running tracks. The first synthetic turf soccer field installed with Nike Grind rubber was Douglas Park in Chicago. That surface was donated by Nike and the U.S. Soccer Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/News/3151.html |title=Gold Medal Soccer Stars Mia Hamm &amp; Briana Scurry Help NikeGO and The U.S. Soccer Foundation Dedicate Chicago Soccer Field|work=Corporate Social Responsibility News|accessdate=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nike uses the granulated foam from the shoes for synthetic [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and playground surfacing tiles. The granulated fabric from the shoe uppers becomes the padding under hardwood basketball floors.

These programs are located in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].

==Processing==

There are two Nike Grind processing plants, one located in the United States and the other in Belgium. The American facility uses a "slice and grind" technique, where each shoe is cut into three slices that contain the main materials. These slices are fed through grinders and purified to become the different types of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nike Partnership: A Perfect Fit For ECORE | work=ECORE International | url=http://www.ecoreintl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian facility grinds the shoes whole, and passes the resulting material through a series of separators for the same three groups of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nike Kicks Off Shoe Recycling Program | work=Sportswear International | url= http://www.sportswearnet.com/marketnews/pages/show.prl?params=&amp;id=530&amp;currPage=16&amp;ori=find }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|paramountcy}}
== Federalist law ==
The doctrine of '''paramountcy''' is the legal principle that reconciles contradicting or conflicting laws in a [[Federalism|federalist]] state, where both the central government, and the provincial or state governments, have the power to create laws in relation to the same matters. In a case where both central and state law exist, central laws will be given priority over state laws through the doctrine of [[Supremacy_Clause|supremacy]]. This is usually applied in cases of post-colonial [[indirect rule]].

== Historical systems ==
In feudalism, paramountcy is a matter of [[Suzerainty]], generally vested in a sovereign Monarch, as the summit of a vassallic pyramid of subject entities.
 
Thus the Mughal badshah (emperor) was the overlord, directly or indirectly, of many native [[princely states]] in pre-colonial India.

In the colonial age and system, paramountcy could similarly be vested in (the crown) of the colonizing imperial power, insofar as it practices [[indirect rule]] over native rulers, but could also be delegated to [[chartered company]].
 
Thus the [[British paramountcy]] in [[British India]] over its [[princely states]] (first by the chartered [[British East India Company]], later by the Colonial Office of the British imperial government) replaced or imitated the Mughal overlordship over a similar, growing list of native states, while some would be annexed. Similarly, the Dutch (first the [[VOIC]], later the government) assumed suzerain paramountcy over the native rulers in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==
The three core tenets of permaculture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Greenblott | first1 = Kara | first2 = Kristof | last2 = Nordin | year = 2012 | title = Permaculture Design for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming: Low-Cost, Sustainable Solutions for Food and Nutrition Insecure Communities | place = Arlington, VA | publisher = USAID | series = AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR-One | number = Task Order 1 | url = http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mollison | 1988 | p =2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: Principles &amp; Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn = 0-646-41844-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.

The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10.

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark. [http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 "Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease"]. Permaculture Research Institute of Australia. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked. [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Joel Salatin]] have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start [[ecological succession]] or prepare ground for planting. [[Allan Savory]]'s [[holistic management]] technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to [[rangeland management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last= Fairlie | publisher= Chelsea Green | year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-60358325-1 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris| url= http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404| work= The Sunday Times | date =  4 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ash|first=Andrew|others=et al.|title=The Ecograze Project – developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|isbn=0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=7 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052228/http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url= http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title | work = CNET | accessdate =7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081104/http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Littman|first= Margaret|title= Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners |work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title= Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/ |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title= Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm | year = 1988 | title = Public Service | type = biography | contribution = Masanobu Fukuoka | publisher = The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation | place = [[The Philippines|PH]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Permaculture Action'''&lt;/big&gt;

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming.

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

A '''profile diagram''' operates at the metamodel level to show stereotypes as classes with the &lt;code&gt;«stereotype»&lt;/code&gt; stereotype, and profiles as packages with the &lt;code&gt;«profile»&lt;/code&gt; stereotype.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt; The extension relation (solid line with closed, filled arrowhead) indicates what metamodel element a given stereotype is extending.

==History==
The profile diagram didn't exist in UML 1. It was introduced with UML 2 to display the usage of profiles. Before its introduction, other diagrams had been used to display this issue.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{Cite book

'''Raison Oblige Theory''' offers an alternate explanation of exhibited behaviors widely accepted to be caused by the motive of [[Self-verification theory|self-verification (SVT)]]([[William Swann]], 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. In J. Suls &amp; A. G. Greenwald (Eds.), Social psychological perspectives on the self (Vol. 2, pp. 33-66). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the ''self-view'' and rational thought, (see [[self-esteem]]; [[self concept]]; [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self knowledge]]) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal-adaptive self verifying behaviors.

* SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Rentfrow, P. J., &amp; Guinn, J. (2002). Self-verification: The search for coherence. In M. Leary and J. Tagney, Handbook of self and identity:  Guilford, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Self-verification theory|self verification]] for details).
* ROT challenges the existence of a motive and offers a plausible explanation which can account for all instances of self-verifying behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P.(2007). Is identity per se irrelevant? A contrarian view of self-verification effects. Depression and Anxiety, 0, 1-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.

ROT was developed by Aiden P. Gregg (2006).

==Overview==

===Self verification===

Self-verifying behavior includes any action which ultimately coincides with and reinforces existing self-views.
*Motivation to self-enhance causes a person with positive self-views to seek positive information: This verifies positivity.
*People with negative self-views, including those diagnosed with depression, show a preference for negative information: This verifies negativity.

An array of empirical evidence demonstrates numerous examples of self-verification.

People with negative self-views prefer to interact with actors who reinforce negative assessments :
::* Evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., &amp; Read, S. J. (1981b). Acquiring self-knowledge: The search for feedback that fits. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41,1119-1128.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Romantic partners.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., De La Ronde, C. &amp; Hixon, J. G. (1994). Authenticity and positivity strivings in marriage and courtship. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66, 857-869.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Roommates.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. &amp; Pelham, B. W.  (2002). Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates.  Journal of Self and Identity, 1, 219-233.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Group members&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Milton, L. P., &amp; Polzer, J.T. (2000). Should we create a niche or fall in line? Identity negotiation and small group effectiveness. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, 238-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of conditions which influence the likelihood of engaging in self verification;
::* Importance of a self view (swann &amp; Pelham 2002)
::* Extremity of a self view.&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, R. B., Josephs, R. A. &amp; Swann, W. B., Jr. (1996). Self-verification in clinical depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 105, 358-368.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Certainty of a self view.&lt;ref&gt;Pelham, B. W., &amp; Swann, W. B., Jr. (1994). The juncture of intrapersonal and interpersonal knowledge: Self-certainty and interpersonal congruence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 20, 349-357.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Perceived threat to identity; (see Swann et al., 2002)
:::* Intelligence of evaluator
:::* Importance of partner providing information (Swann, De La Ronde &amp; Hixon, 1994)

The collective evidence of self-verifying processes and conditions has been interpreted as a motivation to self-verify.

For example; Depressed people opt to receive negative information despite positivity striving of the [[self-enhancement]] motive. This has therefore been interpreted as the result of motivation to self verify. (Giesler et al., 1996)

===Origins of ROT===

The theory originated from criticism of the evidence supporting SVT.

Gregg (2007) disputed that the evidence was weak and circumstantial, and importantly could be better and more economically explained via Raison oblige theory.

Both theories acknowledged the abundance of evidence showing that people behave in a way that confirms their self-view, even when this reinforcement is seemingly [[adaptive behavior|maladaptive]]. As with most psychological theories, observation of behavior provided the most compelling evidence for self verification theory.

::* However, just because a person acts in a certain way does not necessarily dictate that the usually related [[Motivation|motive]] for this behavior is responsible or indeed that the person wants to act this way. Self-defeating behavior such as drug abuse, which is clearly not in the person’s best interest, does not certify that there is a motive to self-defeat.

::* In such an instance it is suggested that the person does not want to act against their best interests, but that they want immediate relief from negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] (Baumeister &amp; Scher, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Scher, S. J. (1988). Self-defeating behavior patterns among normal individuals: review and analysis of common self destructive tendencies. Psychology Bulletin, 104, 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

ROT, unlike SVT, does not explain the observed behavior in terms of a motive. Instead it suggests that an active cognitive process obliges a person to behave in a way that honestly reflects their currently held self-views.

===Underlying assumptions===

[[Rationality]] is often overlooked when considering the causes of exhibited behaviors. When compared to the motives of self-enhancement, self-improvement and self-assessment the effects of rationality might be assumed to be small. However, Gregg (2007) outlines that “rationality is pervasive and motives merely qualify it”.

*ROT draws upon the ability of ration to influence our behaviors and [[cognition]]s.
*Evidence for the effects of rationality are easily seen yet often overlooked due to the compared power of [[Motivation|motives]].

However, if rationality did not strongly influence cognition, self-assessment would rarely be accurate and grandiose [[delusion]]s would be common. As a result, self-enhancement and self-improvement would also be hindered as people would have an inaccurate self-concept and thus be unaware of whether they needed to enhance or improve. Without some sort of obligation to reasonable thought it is unlikely anyone would have an accurate self-concept or strive to make something of themselves.

* This assumption underlies ROT and is the rationale for suggesting that there is a plausible alternative explanation for the evidence of self verifying behaviors.

===Hypothetical situation===

When given the option to interact with person (A) who shares my self views or person (B) who does not, I will opt for person A.

*ROT explains that this choice is based on whether I can earnestly believe the information to be true and representative of myself. Despite the desire for positive information to be true, if I cannot subjectively believe it then I will ignore it.

This hypothetical preference for people who share my self view and avoidance of those who don't has been empirically replicated many times (e.g. Swann, 92;&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Wenzlaff, R. M., Krull, D. S., &amp; Pelham, B. W. (1992). The allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 101, 293-306&lt;/ref&gt; swann 03; Gregg 07)

Importantly, this behavior in which we create a world which shares our self-views does not necessarily demonstrate a motive to do so (Gregg, 07). In fact, if rationality were removed it is likely we would not adhere to self views at all. Instead people would be able to choose a self view they liked and exhibit behaviors accordingly.

*Every healthy person is aware of reality and adheres to an unspoken set of rules of reason permitting them to act in accordance with their physical and mental ability.
*Perceptions of the world around us are bound by rational thought and evidence. Raison Oblige theory extends this binding to reason into the conceptions of our selves, i.e. self view.

==Negative and positive self views==

===Self-esteem===

[[Self-esteem]] has a very strong influence on a person’s self-view. A person with high self-esteem is more likely to have a positive self-view, whereas a person with low self-esteem is more likely to have a negative self-view. Many studies that seemingly provide evidence for a self-verifying motive use self-esteem as a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] to demonstrate that people confirm a self-view that corresponds to their level of self-esteem.

However, one can argue that this behavioral evidence is circumstantial and that the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] does not demonstrate motivation.

*If a person with low self-esteem confirmed a self-view congruent to that of low self-esteem, it does not necessarily provide evidence for motivation to confirm a self-view.
*ROT claims that people are aware of their self-views and believe them to be accurate. As a result, they answer questionnaires honestly, and report their self-views as they truly see them due to an obligation to reason.

people may not ''want'' self-verifying information to be true of them and may ''want'' others to view them positively rather than negatively.

Further research needs to be undertaken to fully investigate the relationship between self views and self-esteem. (see. Gregg, 2007)
::*Do people with low self-esteem ''want'' critical feedback to be true; are they motivated?
::*Do people with low self-esteem actually ''want'' their self view to be accurate, or would they prefer a more positive self view?

ROT predicts that people with low self-esteem are bound by reason to confirm their existing self view but that they don’t necessarily like it (Gregg &amp; De Waal-Anderws, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P., &amp; De Waal-Andrews W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; If a motivation to self-verify were present then people with low self-esteem would not care about what their self-view was, they would instead focus on actively trying to confirm it.

===Depression===

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is accompanied by very low self-esteem and has therefore been a topic of strong interest for those investigating self verifying behaviors. Depression is always accompanied by low self-esteem but having low self-esteem does not necessarily mean you are depressed.

It argued that those suffering with depression, or with generally low negative self-views, will actively seek negative feedback in order to confirm their self-view; they find it more favourable. Giesler et al. (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, R. B., Josephs, R. A., &amp; Swann, W. B. Jr. (1996). Self-verification in clinical depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 105, 358–368.&lt;/ref&gt; tested this prediction by classifying participants into three separate groups; high self-esteem, low self-esteem and depressed individuals. When offered a choice of positive or negative feedback, depressed individuals chose to receive negative feedback 82% of the time, suggesting a strong desire to negatively re-affirm their self view. The seeking of negative feedback in order to self-verify has thus been argued to maintain a depressive state.

ROT challenges this interpretation and suggests that the observed behavior and maintenance of depressive state is caused by an obligation to confirm a depressive self-concept. This particular study, and many others like it can be reinterpreted using ROT. The choice of negative feedback reflects the obligation to choose information consistent with an honestly held self view.

[[Correlation does not imply causation|Correlations do not equal causation]]; The evidence for SVT assumptions of motivation drawn from studies on depression could be circumstantial and therefore do not provide explicit proof of a motive to self-verify.

====Depression, Motivation and Desire====

Motivation is interlinked with desire. I am hungry therefore I am motivated to eat food; I want to eat.

In SVT studies of depressed persons they are asked whether they would like to receive favorable or unfavorable feedback on their personality. In concurrence with SVT and ROT predictions they chose the unfavorable feedback due to a negative self-view.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Pelham, B. W., &amp; Krull, D. S. (1989). Agreeable fancy or disagreeable truth? How people reconcile their self-enhancement and self-verification needs. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, 782-791&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies demonstrate that self-enhancement striving has been overridden by a separate cognitive process.

If a person with high self-esteem confirms their self-view this may not be self-verification as this is more likely to be due to the self-enhancement motive. Therefore, SVT and ROT studies tend to focus on depressive participants who's verification of negative information can not be attributed to self-enhancement.

*However, Recent findings show that people with depression and high self-esteem both want to receive favorable feedback more than critical feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P., &amp; De Waal-Andrews, W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

::*This suggests that people do not ''want'' to receive feedback that confirms their self-view. A lack of desire implies that motivation is not responsible for self-verification.

::*Gregg &amp; De Waal-Andrews (2007) also show that the lower a participant's self-esteem, the less they anticipated liking critical feedback, and the less keen they were for it to be true, supporting ROT predictions.

===Relationships===

One example that is well explained by Raison Oblige Theory is why people stay in abusive relationships. According to Rusbult and Martz (1995) more than 40% of women who seek help from a shelter when being abused by their partner then return to living with their partner and remain in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rusbult, C. E., &amp; Martz, J. M. (1995). Remaining in an abusive relationship: An investment model analysis of nonvoluntary dependence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21(6), 558-571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification theory would explain this by the abused partner’s need to self-verify that the way they are being treated is deserved, in order to establish an accurate self-concept (Swann &amp; Ely, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., &amp; Ely, R. J. (1984). A battle of wills: Self-verification versus behavioral confirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, 1287-1302.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the alternative explanation from Raison Oblige Theory is that an abused individual will rationalise the situation they are in and come to the conclusion that they themselves are in some way causing the abuse. This leads to the honest belief that they deserve the abuse and causes feelings of worthlessness. This results in the abused individual remaining loyal to their partner and failing to seek help, as they believe the abuse is their fault and that they need to improve in some way in order that the abuse will stop. Raison Oblige Theory also explains that the abused partner feels that they will gain no benefit from leaving an abusive relationship, as they see the abuse as their fault. This also explains why the abused individual may defend their partner should anyone outside the relationship become aware of the abuse.

==Evidence==

The mind is difficult to study, often multiple theories can explain a single phenomenon. A theory which explains said phenomenon  more efficiently or can explain additional behaviors is considered the more plausible theory.

*There is no explicit evidence that proves the existence of a motive to self-verify. However, there is a vast expanse of evidence to show that people are obligated to reason in their thoughts.

===Motivation and affect===

Behavior does not always reflect motivation;

::*we do things we don't want to do but are obliged to do (e.g. giving up leisure time to do work)
::*we voluntarily refrain from doing things that we want to do (e.g. making up qualifications to secure a job we want)
::*These examples demonstrate that behavior does not always reflect motivation. However, they do demonstrate a cognitive overruling of desire/motive.

*Motivation incurs negative affect when conditions are not met; I want to improve, I fail; I feel bad.
*Striving to self verify should have an influence on affect.
*A person with a negative self view should therefore be less disturbed by critical feedback than a person with high self-esteem.
::* Depressed: Critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive but bolsters their self verification motive.
::* High self-esteem :critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive(ego) and their self verification motive.

::*High self-esteemed people should be more emotionally disturbed by critical feedback than depressed people. However, this is not the case (Jones, 1975;&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, R. D., &amp; Jones, K. W. (1975). Effects of work load, role ambiguity and Type A personality on anxiety, depression and heart rate. Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, 713-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obligation to ration===

*Day to day examples of obligation to reason; Grandiose delusions are rare.
*We accept new self views after a change in appearance or capabilities; we rationalize changes and challenges.
*People are reasonable in thought, without reason grandiose delusions would have prevented the existence of our species; I can't be killed; I can fight this mammoth alone; I can attack this man without consequence; I am the best person in the world.

====The effect of Ration on motivation====

Self-assessment is bound to rational perception;

::* I believe what is subjectively possible.
::* Assessment is based on accurate perception, not subjective desire: Grandiose delusions are rare

Self-enhancement is bound to rational perception;

::* The [[Illusory superiority|above-average effect]] is bound to the limits of subjective plausibility (Gregg, 2007).
::* specific compared traits succumb to the effect much less because people are aware of their ability compared to others. Commonly held traits can be exaggerated due to a larger latitude of comparison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11589">In [[psychology]] and [[logic]], '''rationalization''' or '''rationalisation''' (also known as '''making excuses'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/02/17/rationalization-as-manipulation-tactic/ Understanding Rationalization: Making Excuses as an Effective Manipulation Tactic]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[defense mechanism]] in which controversial behaviors or feelings are justified and explained in a seemingly rational or logical manner to avoid the true explanation, and are made consciously tolerable—or even admirable and superior—by plausible means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of rationalization|url=http://depression.about.com/od/glossary/g/rationalization.htm|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[informal fallacy]] of [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IEP|first=Bradley |last=Dowden|url-id=fallacy#Rationalization|title=Fallacy § Rationalization|archive-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20141031180537/http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Rationalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalization happens in two steps:
# A decision, action, judgement is made for a given reason, or no (known) reason at all.
# A rationalization is performed, constructing a seemingly good or logical reason, as an attempt to justify the act after the fact (for oneself or others).

Rationalization encourages irrational or unacceptable behavior, motives, or feelings and often involves [[ad hoc hypothesizing]]. This process ranges from fully [[conscious]] (e.g. to present an external defense against ridicule from others) to mostly [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] (e.g. to create a block against internal feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]]). People rationalize for various reasons—sometimes when we think we know ourselves [[Introspection illusion|better than we do]]. Rationalization may differentiate the original deterministic explanation of the behavior or feeling in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/ss/defensemech_6.htm |title=Defense Mechanisms – Rationalization |accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Kendra Van Wagner |publisher=[[About.com]]: Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html |title=Defenses |publisher=www.psychpage.com |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Quintilian]] and classical [[rhetoric]] used the term ''color'' for the presenting of an action in the most favourable possible perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green trans., ''Juvenal: The Sixteen Satires'' "Middlesex 1982) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Sterne]] in the eighteenth century took up the point, arguing that, were a man to consider his actions, "he will soon find, that such of them, as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties [color] which, a soft and flattering hand can give them".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sterne, ''Tristram Shandy'' (Middlesex 1976) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM definition==
According to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]], rationalization occurs "when the individual deals with emotional conflict or internal or external stressors by concealing the true motivations for his or her own thoughts, actions, or feelings through the elaboration of reassuring or self serving but incorrect explanations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Association|first1=published by the American Psychiatric|title=DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.|date=2000|publisher=AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC)|location=United States|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|page=812|edition=4TH ED.|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Individual===
* Rationalization can be used to avoid admitting disappointment: ''"I didn't get the job that I applied for,  [[The Fox and the Grapes|but I really didn't want it in the first place]]."''

Egregious rationalizations intended to deflect blame can also take the form of [[ad hominem]] attacks or [[Denial#DARVO|DARVO]].
Some rationalizations take the form of a comparison. Commonly this is done to lessen the perception of an action's negative effects, to justify an action, or to excuse culpability: 
* ''"At least [what occurred] [[Counterfactual thinking|is not as bad as]] [a worse outcome]."''
* In response to an accusation: ''"At least I didn't [worse action than accused action]."''
* As a form of [[false choice]]: ''"Doing [undesirable action] is a lot better than [a worse action]."''
* In response to unfair or abusive behaviour: ''"I must have done something wrong if they treat me like this."''
Based on anecdotal and survey evidence, John Banja states that the medical field features a disproportionate amount of rationalization invoked in the "[[cover up|covering up]]" of [[Medical errors|mistakes]].&lt;ref name="banja1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Banja |first=John |title=Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism |year=2004 |location=Sudbury |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |isbn=0-7637-8361-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common excuses made are:

*"Why disclose the error? The patient was going to die anyway."
*"Telling the family about the error will only make them feel worse."
*"It was the patient's fault. If he wasn't so (sick etc), this error wouldn't have caused so much harm."
*"Well, we did our best. These things happen."
*"If we're not totally and absolutely certain the error caused the harm, we don't have to tell."
*"They're dead anyway, no point in blaming."

===Collective===

*Collective rationalizations are regularly [[Social constructivism|constructed]] for acts of [[aggression]],{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|p=513}} based on exaltation of the in-group and demonization of the opposite side: as [[Fritz Perls]] put it, "Our own soldiers take care of the poor families; the enemy rapes them".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Perls, ''Gestalt Theory Verbatim'' (Bantam 1971) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Celebrity culture]] can be seen as rationalizing the gap between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, by offering participation to both dominant and [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] views of reality.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Marshall, ''Celebrity and Power'' (1997) pp. 48–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some scientists criticize the notion that brains are wired to rationalize irrational decisions, arguing that evolution would select against spending more nutrients at mental processes that do not contribute to the improvement of decisions such as rationalization of decisions that would have been taken anyway. These scientists argue that learning from mistakes would be decreased rather than increased by rationalization, and criticize the hypothesis that rationalization evolved as a means of social manipulation by noting that if rational arguments were deceptive there would be no evolutionary chance for breeding individuals that responded to the arguments and therefore making them ineffective and not capable of being selected for by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Pfeifer and Josh Bongard ''How the Body Shapes the Way We Think. A New View of Intelligence'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalysis==
{{Main|Psychoanalysis}}
[[Ernest Jones]] introduced the term "rationalization" to psychoanalysis in 1908, defining it as "the inventing of a reason for an attitude or action the motive of which is not recognized"'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;—an explanation which (though false) could seem plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Maddox, ''Freud's Wizard'' (London 2006) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The term (''Rationalisierung'' in [[German language|German]]) was taken up almost immediately by [[Sigmund Freud]] to account for the explanations offered by patients for their own neurotic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Psychoanalytische Bemerkungen über einen autobiographisch beschriebenen Fall von Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)", 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

As psychoanalysts continued to explore the glossed of unconscious motives, [[Otto Fenichel]] distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions on the grounds that they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown on the grounds that they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 485–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Later psychoanalysts are divided between a positive view of rationalization as a stepping-stone on the way to maturity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateman|first1=Anthony|last2=Holmes|first2=Jeremy|title=Introduction to Psychoanalysis: Contemporary Theory and Practice|date=1995|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415107396|pages=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mo2r2_aBeDIC&amp;pg=PA92|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a more destructive view of it as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] feeling from thought, and so undermining the powers of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Symington|first1=Neville|title=Narcissism: A New Theory|date=1993|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9781781811252|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZPHA4grXMMC&amp;pg=PA119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive dissonance==
{{Main|Cognitive dissonance}}
[[Leon Festinger]] highlighted in 1957 the discomfort caused people by awareness of inconsistent thought.{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|pp=277–8}} Rationalization can reduce such discomfort by explaining away the discrepancy in question, as when people who take up smoking after previously quitting decide that the evidence for it being harmful is less than they previously thought.{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|pp=280–4}}

'''Self-propelled particles''' (SPP), also referred to as '''self-driven particles,''' are terms used by physicists to describe [[autonomous agent]]s, which convert energy from the environment into directed or persistent motion. Natural systems which have inspired the study and design of these particles include walking, swimming or flying animals. Other biological systems include bacteria, cells, algae and other micro-organisms. Generally, self-propelled particles often refer to artificial systems such as robots or specifically designed particles such as swimming [[Janus particles|Janus colloids]], [[nanomotors]] and walking grains. In the case of directed propulsion, which is driven by a chemical gradient, this is referred to as [[chemotaxis|chemotaxis,]] observed in biological systems, e.g. bacteria quorum sensing and ant pheromone detection, and in synthetic systems, e.g. bimetallic nanorods and enzyme molecule chemotaxis. 

==Overview==
Self-propelled particles interact with each other, which can lead to the emergence of collective behaviours. These collective behaviours mimic the self-organization observed with the flocking of birds, the swarming of bugs, the formation of sheep herds, etc.

To understand the ubiquity of such phenomena, physicists have developed a number of self-propelled particles models. These models predict that self-propelled particles share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals (or artificial particles) in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al" /&gt;  It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toner | first1 = J. | last2 = Tu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ramaswamy | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/3397/1/A89.pdf | title = Hydrodynamics and phases of flocks | journal = [[Annals of Physics]] | volume = 318 | issue = 170 | doi = 10.1016/j.aop.2005.04.011 | pages = 170–244 | bibcode=2005AnPhy.318..170T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertin et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertin | first1 = E. | last2 = Droz | first2 = M. | last3 = Grégoire | first3 = G. | year = 2009 | arxiv = 0907.4688 | title = Hydrodynamic equations for self-propelled particles: microscopic derivation and stability analysis | journal = [[Journal of Physics A]] | volume = 42 | issue = 44 | page = 445001 | doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/42/44/445001 |bibcode = 2009JPhA...42R5001B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Li|first1 = Y.

=== Biological systems ===
Most animals can be seen as SPP: they find energy in their food and exhibit various locomotion strategies, from flying to crawling. The most prominent examples of collective behaviours in these systems are fish schools, birds flocks, sheep herds, human crowds. At a smaller scale, cells and bacteria can also be treated as SPP. These biological systems can propel themselves based on the presence of chemoattractants.  At even smaller scale, [[Molecular motor|molecular motors]] transform ATP energy into directional motion. Recent work has shown that enzyme molecules will also propel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Substrate Catalysis Enhances Single Enzyme Diffusion|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2010-02-24|issn = 0002-7863|pmc = 2832858|pmid = 20108965|pages = 2110–2111|volume = 132|issue = 7|doi = 10.1021/ja908773a|first = Hari S.|last = Muddana|first2 = Samudra|last2 = Sengupta|first3 = Thomas E.|last3 = Mallouk|first4 = Ayusman|last4 = Sen|first5 = Peter J.|last5 = Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been shown that they will preferentially move towards a region of higher substrate concentration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Enzyme Molecules as Nanomotors|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja3091615|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2013-01-30|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 1406–1414|volume = 135|issue = 4|doi = 10.1021/ja3091615|first = Samudra|last = Sengupta|first2 = Krishna K.|last2 = Dey|first3 = Hari S.|last3 = Muddana|first4 = Tristan|last4 = Tabouillot|first5 = Michael E.|last5 = Ibele|first6 = Peter J.|last6 = Butler|first7 = Ayusman|last7 = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon that has been developed into a purification technique to isolate live enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemotactic Separation of Enzymes|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn504418u|journal = ACS Nano|date = 2014-12-23|issn = 1936-0851|pages = 11941–11949|volume = 8|issue = 12|doi = 10.1021/nn504418u|first = Krishna Kanti|last = Dey|first2 = Sambeeta|last2 = Das|first3 = Matthew F.|last3 = Poyton|first4 = Samudra|last4 = Sengupta|first5 = Peter J.|last5 = Butler|first6 = Paul S.|last6 = Cremer|first7 = Ayusman|last7 = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, microparticles can become self-propelled when they are functionalized with enzymes.

=== Artificial systems ===
[[File:AuPtnanomotor.jpg|thumb|An example of a SPP: a gold-platinum nanorod which undergoes self-propulsion in hydrogen peroxide due to self-electrophoretic forces.|400x400px]]

There is a distinction between wet and dry systems. In the first case the particles "swim" in a surrounding fluid; in the second case the particles  "walk" on a substrate. 

Active colloidal particles, dubbed [[Nanomotor|nanomotors]], are the prototypical example of wet SPP. [[Janus particles]] are colloidal particles with two different sides, having different physical or chemical properties. This [[symmetry breaking]] allows, by properly tuning the environment (typically the surrounding solution), for the motion of the Janus particle. For instance, the two sides of the Janus particle can induce a local gradient of, temperature, electric field, or concentration of chemical species. This induces motion of the Janus particle along the gradient through, respectively, [[thermophoresis]], [[electrophoresis]] or [[diffusiophoresis]]. Because the Janus particles consume energy from their environment (catalysis of chemical reactions, light absorption, etc.), the resulting motion constitutes an irreversible process and the particles are out of equilibrium.  
* The first example of an artificial SPP on the nano or micron scale was a gold-platinum bimetallic nanorod developed by [[Ayusman Sen|Sen]] and Mallouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalytic Nanomotors:  Autonomous Movement of Striped Nanorods|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja047697z|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 13424–13431|volume = 126|issue = 41|doi = 10.1021/ja047697z|first = Walter F.|last = Paxton|first2 = Kevin C.|last2 = Kistler|first3 = Christine C.|last3 = Olmeda|first4 = Ayusman|last4 = Sen|first5 = Sarah K.|last5 = St. Angelo|first6 = Yanyan|last6 = Cao|first7 = Thomas E.|last7 = Mallouk|first8 = Paul E.|last8 = Lammert|first9 = Vincent H.|last9 = Crespi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a solution of hydrogen peroxide, this "nanomotor" would exhibit a catalytic oxidation-reduction reaction, thereby inducing a fluid flow along the surface through self-diffusiophoresis. A similar system used a copper-platinum rod in a bromine solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Autonomous Nanomotor Based on Copper–Platinum Segmented Nanobattery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2082735|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2011-12-21|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 20064–20067|volume = 133|issue = 50|doi = 10.1021/ja2082735|first = Ran|last = Liu|first2 = Ayusman|last2 = Sen|pmid=21961523}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Another Janus SPP was developed by coating half of a polystyrene bead with platinum. These were used to direct the motion of catalytic motors when they were close to a solid surface. These systems were able to move the active colloids using geometric constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Sambeeta|last2=Garg|first2=Astha|last3=Campbell|first3=Andrew I.|last4=Howse|first4=Jonathan|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|last7=Golestanian|first7=Ramin|last8=Ebbens|first8=Stephen J.|date=2015-12-02|title=Boundaries can steer active Janus spheres|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms9999|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms9999|issn=2041-1723|pmc=4686856|pmid=26627125|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8999D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another example of a Janus SPP is an organometallic motor using a gold-silica microsphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Polymerization-Powered Motor|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201103565/abstract|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date = 2011-09-26|issn = 1521-3773|pages = 9374–9377|volume = 50|issue = 40|doi = 10.1002/anie.201103565|language = en|first = Ryan A.|last = Pavlick|first2 = Samudra|last2 = Sengupta|first3 = Timothy|last3 = McFadden|first4 = Hua|last4 = Zhang|first5 = Ayusman|last5 = Sen|pmid=21948434}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grubbs' catalyst|Grubb's catalyst]] was tethered to the silica half of the particle and in solution of monomer would drive a catalytic polymerization. The resulting concentration gradient across the surface would propel the motor in solution.
*Several other examples are described in the [[Nanomotor|nanomotor-]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;specific page.

Walking grains are a typical realization of dry SPP: The grains are milli-metric disks sitting on a vertically vibrating plate, which serves as the source of energy and momentum. The disks have two different contacts ("feet") with the plate, a hard needle-like foot in the front and a large soft rubber foot in the back. When shaken, the disks move in a preferential direction defined by the polar (head-tail) symmetry of the contacts.  This together with the vibrational noise result in a persistent random walk.&lt;ref&gt;Deseigne J., Dauchot O. and Chaté H. (2010) [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001 "Collective motion of vibrated polar disks"]. ''Physical review letters'', '''105''' (9):098001. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical collective behaviour ==
Typical [[collective motion]] generally includes the formation of self-assembled structures, such as clusters and organized assemblies. 

The prominent and most spectacular emergent large scale behaviour observed in assemblies of SPP is directed [[collective motion]]. In that case all particles move in the same direction. On top of that, spatial structures can emerge such as bands, vortices, asters, moving clusters.

Another class of large scale behaviour, which does ''not'' imply directed motion is either the spontaneous formation of clusters or the separation in a gas-like and a liquid-like phase, an unexpected phenomenon when the SPP have purely repulsive interaction. This phase separation has been called Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS).

== Examples of modelling ==

The modeling of SPP was introduced in 1995 by [[Tamás Vicsek]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vicsek | first1 = T. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Ben-Jacob | first3 = E. | last4 = Cohen | first4 = I. | last5 = Shochet | first5 = O. | year = 1995 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611743 | title = Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 75 | pages = 1226–1229 | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0611743 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226 | issue = 6 | bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V | pmid=10060237}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a special case of the [[Boids]] model introduced in 1986 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = C.W. | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | isbn = 0897912276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case the SPP are point particles, which move with a constant speed. and adopt (at each time increment) the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighborhood up to some added noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Czirók | first1 = A. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2006 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611742 | title = Collective behavior of interacting self-propelled particles | journal = [[Physica A]] | volume = 281 | pages = 17–29 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4371(00)00013-3 | bibcode=2000PhyA..281...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jadbabaie2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jadbabaie | first1 = A. | last2 = Lin | first2 = J. | last3 = Morse | first3 = A.S. | year = 2003 | title = Coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents using nearest neighbor rules | journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 988–1001 | doi = 10.1109/TAC.2003.812781 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.128.5326 | postscript = &amp;nbsp;– }} convergence proofs for the SPP model.&lt;/ref&gt;{{External media

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralised coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time (see the interactive simulation in the box on the right).&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"/&gt;

Since then a number of models have been proposed, ranging from the simples so called Active Brownian Particle to highly elaborated and specialized models aiming at describing specific systems and situations. Among the important ingredients in these models, one can list 
* Self-propulsion: in the absence of interaction, the SPP speed converges to a prescribed constant value
* Body interactions: the particles can be considered as points (no body interaction) like in the Vicsek model. Alternatively one can include an interaction potential, either attractive or repulsive.  This potential can be isotropic or not to describe spherical or elongated particles.
* Body orientation:  for those particles with a body-fixed axis, one can include additional degrees of freedom to describe the orientation of the body. The coupling of this body axis with the velocity is an additional option.
* Aligning interaction rules: in the spirit of the Vicsek model, neighboring particles align their velocities. An other possibility is that they align their orientations.
One can also include effective influences of the surrounding; for instance the nominal velocity of the SPP can be set to depend on the local density, in order to take into account crowding effects.

==Some applications to real systems==

===Marching locusts===
Young [[desert locust]]s are solitary and wingless [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]]. If food is short they can gather together and start occupying neighbouring areas, recruiting more locusts. Eventually they can become a marching army extending over many kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Uvarov | first = B. P. | year = 1977 | series = Grasshopper and locust: a handbook of general acridology | volume = II | title = Behaviour, ecology, biogeography, population dynamics | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the prelude to the development of the vast flying adult locust swarms which devastate vegetation on a continental scale.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Symmons | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Cressman | first2 = K. | year = 2001 | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/common/ecg/347_en_DLG1e.pdf | title = Desert locust guidelines: Biology and behaviour | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] | location = Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key predictions of the SPP model is that as the [[population density]] of a group increases, an abrupt transition occurs from individuals moving in relatively disordered and independent ways within the group to the group moving as a highly aligned whole.&lt;ref name="Huepe and Aldana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huepe | first1 = A. | last2 = Aldana | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | url = http://lims.mech.northwestern.edu/~lynch/IGERT499/huepe-PRL2004.pdf | title = Intermittency and clustering in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 92 | issue = 16 | page = 168701 [4 pages] | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.168701 | bibcode=2004PhRvL..92p8701H | pmid=15169268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the case of young desert locusts, a trigger point should occur which turns disorganised and dispersed locusts into a coordinated marching army. When the critical population density is reached, the insects should start marching together in a stable way and in the same direction.

In 2006, a group of researchers examined how this model held up in the laboratory. Locusts were placed in a circular arena, and their movements were tracked with computer software. At low densities, below 18 locusts per square metre, the locusts mill about in a disordered way. At intermediate densities, they start falling into line and marching together, punctuated by abrupt but coordinated changes in direction. However, when densities reached a critical value at about 74 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the locusts ceased making rapid and spontaneous changes in direction, and instead marched steadily in the same direction for the full eight hours of the experiment (see video on the left). This confirmed the behaviour predicted by the SPP models.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhl | first1 = J. | last2 = Sumpter | first2 = D. J. T. | last3 = Couzin | first3 = D. | last4 = Hale | first4 = J. J. | last5 = Despland | first5 = E. | last6 = Miller | first6 = E. R. | last7 = Simpson | first7 = S.

In the field, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], the average density of marching bands is 50 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50 million locusts/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with a typical range from 20 to 120 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The research findings discussed above demonstrate the dynamic instability that is present at the lower locust densities typical in the field, where marching groups randomly switch direction without any external perturbation. Understanding this phenomenon, together with the switch to fully coordinated marching at higher densities, is essential if the swarming of desert locusts is to be controlled.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"/&gt;

===Bird landings===
[[File:The flock of starlings acting as a swarm. - geograph.org.uk - 124593.jpg|thumb|right|Flocks of birds can abruptly change their direction in unison, and then, just as suddenly, make a unanimous group decision to land&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya"/&gt;]]
Swarming animals, such as ants, bees, fish and birds, are often observed suddenly switching from one state to another. For example, birds abruptly switch from a flying state to a landing state. Or fish switch from schooling in one direction to schooling in another direction. Such state switches can occur with astonishing speed and synchronicity, as though all the members in the group made a unanimous decision at the same moment. Phenomena like these have long puzzled researchers.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday"&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/201411.php | title = Self-Propelled Particle System Improves Understanding Of Behavioral Patterns | publisher = [[Medical News Today]] | date = 18 Sep 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bhattacharya and Vicsek used an SPP model to analyse what is happening here. As a paradigm, they considered how flying birds arrive at a collective decision to make a sudden and synchronised change to land. The birds, such as the starlings in the image on the right, have no decision-making leader, yet the flock know exactly how to land in a unified way. The need for the group to land overrides deviating intentions by individual birds. The particle model found that the collective shift to landing depends on perturbations that apply to the individual birds, such as where the birds are in the flock.&lt;ref name= "Bhattacharya"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharya | first1 = K. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | arxiv = 1007.4453 | title = Collective decision making in cohesive flocks |bibcode = 2010NJPh...12i3019B |doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093019 | volume=12 | journal=New Journal of Physics | pages=093019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is behaviour that can be compared with the way that sand avalanches, if it is piled up, before the point at which symmetric and carefully placed grains would avalanche, because the fluctuations become increasingly non-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Somfai | first1 = E. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Vicsek | first3 = T. | year = 1994 | title = Power-law distribution of landslides in an experiment on the erosion of a granular pile | journal = [[Journal of Physics A|Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General]] | volume = 27 | issue = 20 | pages = L757–L763 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/27/20/001 | bibcode = 1994JPhA...27L.757S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our main motivation was to better understand something which is puzzling and out there in nature, especially in cases involving the stopping or starting of a collective behavioural pattern in a group of people or animals ... We propose a simple model for a system whose members have the tendency to follow the others both in space and in their state of mind concerning a decision about stopping an activity.

The '''single responsibility principle''' is a computer programming principle that states that every [[Modular programming|module]] or [[Class (computer programming)|class]] should have responsibility over a single part of the [[Software feature|functionality]] provided by the [[software]], and that responsibility should be entirely [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulated]] by the class. All its [[Service (systems architecture)|services]] should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. [[Robert C. Martin]] expresses the principle as, "A class should have only one reason to change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Robert C.|authorlink = Robert Cecil Martin|title=Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2003|isbn=978-0135974445|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HYhAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, because of confusion around the word "reason" he more recently stated "This principle is about people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Single Responsibility Principle |publisher=ArticleS.UncleBob |year=2014 |url=https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was introduced by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] in an article by the same name as part of his ''Principles of Object Oriented Design'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Principles of OOD |publisher=ArticleS.UncleBob |year=2005 |url=http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod}}&lt;/ref&gt; made popular by his book ''Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2003|pp=95-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin described it as being based on the principle of [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], as described by [[Tom DeMarco]] in his book ''Structured Analysis and System Specification'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = DeMarco |first = Tom. |authorlink = Tom DeMarco |title = Structured Analysis and System Specification |publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] |year = 1979 |isbn = 0-13-854380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meilir Page-Jones in ''The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Page-Jones|first = Meilir |authorlink = Meilir Page-Jones |title = The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design |publisher = [[Yourdon Press Computing Series]] |year = 1988 |isbn = 978-8120314825|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] wrote a blog post entitled [https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html The Single Responsibility Principle] with a goal to clarify what was meant by the phrase "reason for change."

==Example==
Martin defines a responsibility as a ''reason to change'', and concludes that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed (i.e. rewritten). As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Imagine such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report could change. Second, the format of the report could change. These two things change for very different causes; one substantive, and one cosmetic. The single responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should therefore be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times.

The reason it is important to keep a class focused on a single concern is that it makes the class more robust. Continuing with the foregoing example, if there is a change to the report compilation process, there is greater danger that the printing code will break if it is part of the same class.

'''Social exchange theory''' is a [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychological]] and [[sociological perspective]] that explains social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between parties. Social exchange theory posits that human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s are formed by the use of a subjective cost-benefit analysis and the comparison of alternatives.  The theory has roots in [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social exchange theory features many of the main assumptions found in [[rational choice theory]] and [[structuralism]].
It is also used quite frequently in the business world to imply a two-sided, mutually contingent and rewarding process involving transactions or simply exchange.

==History==

Social exchange theory goes back to Thibaut and Kelley (1959), Kelley and Thibaut (1978), Homans (1961) and Rusbult (1983). Sociologist [[George Homans]] published a work "Social Behavior as Exchange".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karen S. Cook and Erick R. W.Rice. Department of Sociology, Stanford University, Stanford California 94305. Handbook of Sociological Theory, edited by Jonathan H. Turner. kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers, New York.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity, tangible or intangible, and more or less rewarding or costly, between at least two persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Homans|first=George|title=Social Behavior: Its Elementary Forms.|year=1961|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Homans founded the theory, other theorists continued to write about it, particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson, who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Homans' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another. Although there are various modes of exchange, Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Karen S. |first2=Eric |last2=Rice |year= |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnVAuljbRcQC&amp;pg=PA53 |pages=53–76 |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=DeLamater|editor-link1=John DeLamater |title=The Handbook of Social Psychology |isbn=978-0-387-36921-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts, the dyad and small group.&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003|title=Social Exchange Theory|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=2|pages=335–362|year=1976|last1=Emerson|first1=R M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lévi-Strauss]] is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation–satiation proposition.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;
#Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action.
#Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it.
#Deprivation–satiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes.

[[Peter Blau]] focused his early writings on social exchange theory more towards the economic and utilitarian perspective, whereas Homans focused on reinforcement principles which presuppose individuals base their next social move on past experiences. Blau's utilitarian focus encouraged the theorist to look forward, as in what they anticipated the reward would be in regards to their next social interaction.&lt;ref name = Cook /&gt; Blau felt that if individuals focused too much on the psychological concepts within the theory, they would refrain from learning the developing aspects of social exchange.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt; Blau emphasized technical economic analysis whereas Homans concentrated more on the psychology of instrumental behavior.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt;

Richard Emerson's early work on the theory intertwined with both Homans and Blau's ideas. Homans believed that social exchange theory was based on reinforcement principles. According to Emerson, Exchange is not a theory, but a framework from which other theories can converge and be compared to structural functionalism.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;  Emerson's perspective was similar to Blau's since they both focused on the relationship power had with the exchange process.&lt;ref name = Cook/&gt; Emerson says that social exchange theory is an approach in sociology that is described for simplicity as an economic analysis of noneconomic social situations.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt; Exchange theory brings a quasi-economic form of analysis into those situations.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;

==Self-interest and interdependence==
[[Self-interest]] and [[interdependence]] are central properties of social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=223504 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.217|title=Bringing Emotions into Social Exchange Theory|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=25|pages=217–244|year=1999|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.|last2=Thye|first2=Shane R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the basic forms of interaction when two or more actors have something of value to each other, and they have to decide whether to exchange and in what amounts.&lt;ref name=Lawler /&gt; Homans uses the concepts of [[individualism]] to explain exchange processes. To him, the meaning of individual self-interest is a combination of economic and psychological needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekeh |first1=Peter P. |title=Social exchange theory: the two traditions |location=Cambridge, Mass |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1974}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulfilling self-interest is often common within the economic realm of the social exchange theory where competition and greed can be common.&lt;ref name="McDonell, J 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonell |first1=J. |last2=Strom-Gottfried |first2=K.

R. |editor3-last=Canda |title=Contemporary human behavior theory: a critical perspective for social work |publisher=Pearson |pages=349–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In social exchange, self-interest is not a negative thing; rather, when self-interest is recognized, it will act as the guiding force of interpersonal relationships for the advancement of both parties' self-interest"—Michael Roloff (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Roloff| first=Michael
 | year=1981
 | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach
 | publisher=Beverly Hills}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thibaut and Kelley see the mutual interdependence of persons as the central problem for the study of social behavior. They developed a [[Interdependence theory|theoretical framework]] based on the interdependence of actors. They also highlighted social implications of different forms of interdependence such as reciprocal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. K. |title=Social exchange theory: its structure and influence in social psychology |location=London |publisher=Academic Press |year=1976 |oclc=163977277}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their interdependence definition, outcomes are based on a combination of parties' efforts and mutual and complementary arrangements.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

==Basic concepts==
Social exchange theory views exchange as a social behavior that may result both in economic and social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J033v08n03_01|title=Social Exchange Theory and Research on Business-to-Business Relational Exchange|journal=Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing|volume=8|issue=3|pages=1–36|year=2001|last1=Lambe|first1=C. Jay|last2=Wittmann|first2=C. Michael|last3=Spekman|first3=Robert E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social exchange theory has been generally analyzed by comparing human interactions with the marketplace. The study of the theory from the microeconomics perspective is attributed to Blau.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Under his perspective every individual is trying to maximize his wins. Blau stated that once this concept is understood, it is possible to observe social exchanges everywhere, not only in market relations, but also in other social relations like friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4193943 |doi=10.1177/000169937301600303 |title=A Structural Theory of Social Exchange |journal=Acta Sociologica |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=188–208 |year=1973 |last1=Burns |first1=T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social exchange process brings satisfaction when people receive fair returns for their expenditures. The major difference between social and economic exchange is the nature of the exchange between parties. Neoclassic economic theory views the actor as dealing not with another actor but with a market and environmental parameters, such as market price.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Karen S., and Richard Marc Emerson. Social exchange theory. Beverly Hills, Calif.: SAGE Publications, 1987. Print.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike economic exchange, the elements of social exchange are quite varied and cannot be reduced to a single quantitative exchange rate.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"&gt;"SOCIAL EXCHANGE THEORY."

===Cost and rewards===
Simple social exchange models assume that rewards and costs drive relationship decisions.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; Both parties in a social exchange take responsibility for one another and depend on each other. The elements of relational life include:

'''Costs''' are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages=186–7
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.)

'''Rewards''' are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.)

As with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:{{math|Worth {{=}} Rewards − Costs}}

If worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt;

:{{math|Outcome {{=}} Rewards − Costs}}
Homans based his theory on [[behaviorism]] to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs.  The "satisfactory-ness" of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt;

== Aging ==
The basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiate exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person's life course through the various relationships, opportunities and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonucci|first=T.

Within this model there are different types of support ([[Social support]]) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/hbhe4/part3-ch9-key-constructs-social-support.shtml|title=Health Behavior and Health Education {{!}} Part Three, Chapter Nine: Key Constructs Social Support|website=www.med.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical propositions==

Ivan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory.&lt;ref name="McDonell, J 2006"/&gt;

# Individuals choose those alternatives from which they expect the most profit.
# Cost being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the greatest rewards.
# Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs.
# Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long-  term outcomes.
# Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes.
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval).
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy.
# Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes.
# Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one's desirability in the social marketplace.)
# In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures.

In his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship, A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefor act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds. &lt;ref&gt;Nye, F. I. (1978). Is Choice and Exchange Theory the Key?. ''Journal Of Marriage &amp; Family'', ''40''(2), 219-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homans's theoretical propositions===
Even though Homans took an [[individualistic]] approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange.  By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; According to Homans, [[social structures]] emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2083448 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000545|title=Two Approaches to Social Structure: Exchange Theory and Network Analysis|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=18|pages=109–127|year=1992|last1=Cook|first1=K. S.|last2=Whitmeyer|first2=J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals' behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans's version of social exchange theory.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The first proposition: the Success Proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
* The second proposition: the Stimulus Proposition believes that if an individual's behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The third proposition: the Value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The fourth proposition: the Deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

==Assumptions==
Social exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt; All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories.
The assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following:&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory
 | page=188
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments.
*Humans are rational beings.
*The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person.

The assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following:&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt;

*Relationships are interdependent.
*Relational life is a process.

The [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | last2=Kelley | first2=H.
 | year=1959
 | title= The social psychology of groups
 | publisher=New York Wiley}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All relationships involve exchanges although the balance of this exchange is not always equal. We cannot achieve our goals alone so as humans sometimes we have to become actors. In the world today we see actors as unemotional people but that is not the case once we reach our goals in the end.

==Comparison levels==
Social exchange includes "both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206307307635|title=Taking a Multifoci Approach to the Study of Justice, Social Exchange, and Citizenship Behavior: The Target Similarity Model |journal=Journal of Management|volume=33|issue=6|pages=841–866|year=2007|last1=Lavelle|first1=J. J.|last2=Rupp|first2=D. E.|last3=Brockner|first3=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Thibaut]] and [[Harold Kelley]] proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: '''Comparison Level''' and '''Comparison Level for Alternative'''. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the Comparison Level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual's comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |first1=John |last1=Thibaut |first2=Harold |last2=Kelley |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |pages=196–205 |chapterurl=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/socialexchange.pdf |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-338502-0 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Comparison Level for Alternative (CLalt) refers to "the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Roloff| first=Michael
 | year=1981
 | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach
 | page=48
 | publisher=Beverly Hills}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=West | first=Richard | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn | year=2007 | title=Introducing Communication Theory | page=191 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of exchange==
According to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in Behavioral Sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are [[rational]].&lt;ref name="West 2007 193"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory
 | page=193
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: "It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Peter M.|title=Exchange &amp; Power in Social Life|year=1964|publisher=Transaction| isbn = 9780887386282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeh, Peter P.. Social exchange theory: the two traditions. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process begins when at least one participant makes a "move", and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies.&lt;ref name=Zafirovski /&gt;

===Power dependence relations===
Several definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=David|title=Power and Social Exchange|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1229–1242|jstor=1954536|doi=10.2307/1954536}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson,&lt;ref name="Befu1977"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Befu |first=H. |year=1977 |title=Social Exchange |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue= |pages=255–81 |jstor=2949333 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.06.100177.001351}}&lt;/ref&gt; who developed a theory of power-dependence relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Auld |first=C. |last2=Case |first2=A. |title=Social exchange processes in leisure and non-leisure settings: A review and exploratory investigation |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |year=1997 |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=183 |doi= |url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188" /&gt; Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another.&lt;ref name=Zafirovski&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zafirovski |first=Milan |title=Social Exchange Theory Under Scrutiny: A Positive Critique of its Economic-Behaviorist Formulations |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2005 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103311/http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use.&lt;ref name="Zafirovski" /&gt; Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.&lt;ref&gt;(Stolte and Emerson, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner's outcomes.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt; Behavior control is the power to cause another's behavior to change by changing one's own behavior.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt;

===Matrices===
People develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt; These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory

 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors(the specific skills each interactant possesses).&lt;ref name="West 2007 193"/&gt;
*The effective matrix "which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Roloff| first=Michael
 | year=1981

There are three forms within these matrices: [[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]], Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity:&lt;ref name = Cropanzano&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206305279602|title=Social Exchange Theory: An Interdisciplinary Review|journal=Journal of Management|volume=31|issue=6|pages=874–900|year=2005|last1=Cropanzano|first1=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges
#Reciprocity as a folk belief
#Reciprocity as a moral norm

A generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0190272509359616|year=2010|title=The Contentious Social Interactionism of Charles Tilly|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|last1=Collins|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously.

Another common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement.&lt;ref name=Cropanzano /&gt; Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"/&gt; An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"/&gt; Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement.

==Critiques==

Katherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Katherine| first=Miller

*The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory.
*The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn’t the best option in a relationship.
*The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case.
*The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy.

Russell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules.&lt;ref name = Cropanzano/&gt; Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as [[altruism]], group gain, status consistency and competition.&lt;ref name = Cropanzano/&gt; Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D | year = 2015 | title = The process of exchange, solidarity and sustainable development in building a community of responsibility | url = | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1S1 | page = 507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meeker | first1 = B.

Rosenfeld (2005) has noted significant limitations to Social Exchange Theory and its application in the selection of mates/partners. Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange mute.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, M. J. (2005). A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection. ''American Journal Of Sociology'', ''110''(5), 1284-1325. doi:10.1086/428441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

The most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources.  Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating:

:Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum ("Theories Used in Research").

===Anthropology===
Other applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of [[anthropology]] as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and [[social norm|norms]].  Lévi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered.&lt;ref name="Befu1977" /&gt; Lévi–Strauss uses a [[collectivist]] approach to explain exchanges. To Lévi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms.  This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=256704 |doi=10.2307/256704|pmid=10134637|title=Citizenship Behavior and Social Exchange|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pages=656–69|year=1994|last1=Konovsky|first1=M. A.|last2=Pugh|first2=S. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lévi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref name="Befu1977" /&gt;

===Relationships===
Throughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study titled, Factors Related to Initiating Interpersonal Contacts on Internet Dating Sites: A View From the social exchange theory applied this theory to new media (online dating). The study discovers the different factors involved when an individual decides to establish an online relationship.&lt;ref name="online dating"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5964/ijpr.v3isupp2.74|title=Factors Related to Initiating Interpersonal Contacts on Internet Dating Sites: A View from the Social Exchange Theory|journal=Interpersona: an International Journal on Personal Relationships|volume=3|pages=19–37|year=2009|last1=Shtatfeld|first1=Rivka|last2=Barak|first2=Azy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the study followed the social exchange theory's idea, "people are attracted to those who grant them rewards".&lt;ref name="online dating"/&gt;

Another example is Berg's study about development of friendship between roommates. The research found how social exchange processes changed during the year by measuring [[Self-disclosure|self disclosure]]. According to the study, the amount one person rewards another and the comparison levels for alternatives become the most important factors in determining liking and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Auld, C. J. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher J. |last1=Auld |first2=Alan J. |last2=Case |year=1997 |title=Social Exchange Processes in Leisure and Non-leisure Settings: A Review and Exploratory Investigation |url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auld, C. and Alan C. conducted a study to discover what processes occur and what is experienced during social leisure relationships. They use the concept of reciprocity to understand their findings. The study concluded that meeting new people is often given as a major reason for participation in leisure activities, and meeting new people may be conceptualized as an exercise of reciprocity. In this case, reciprocity is perceived as a starting mechanism for new social relationships because people are willing to be helped by others, expecting that the help will eventually be returned.&lt;ref name="Auld, C. J. 1997"/&gt; A study conducted by Paul, G., called Exchange and access in field work tries to understand the relationships between the researchers and subjects. This study concludes that [[Bargaining]] helps to satisfy the more specific needs of the parties because greater risks are taken to obtain more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Paul S. |year=1980 |title=Exchange and Access in Field Work |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=309–331 |doi=10.1177/089124168000900303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also introduces the concept of [[trust (social sciences)]] to determine the duration of relationships.

===Interracial marriage===
Patterns of [[interracial marriage]] have been explained using social exchange theory. Kalmijn &lt;ref name="Kalmijn"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2580162 |doi=10.1093/sf/72.1.119|title=Trends in Black/White Intermarriage|journal=Social Forces|volume=72|pages=119–146|year=1993|last1=Kalmijn|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ethnic status is offset against educational or financial resources. This process has been used to explain why there are more marriages between black men and white women than between white men and black women. This asymmetry in marriage patterns has been used to support the idea of a racial hierarchy. Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22347504 |pmc=3276508|bibcode=2012PLoSO...731703L|title=A Facial Attractiveness Account of Gender Asymmetries in Interracial Marriage|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=31703|last1=Lewis|first1=Michael B.|year=2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031703}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, explains that the same patterns of marriage can be accounted for in terms of simple facial attractiveness patterns of the different gender by race groupings. Recent changes have seen an increase in black females marrying white men and a decrease in raw prevalence of interracial marriages when it comes to black females. There has also been a shift in the concentration of interracial marriage from mostly being between those with low education levels to those with higher levels of education.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fryer|first=Roland G|date=Spring 2007|title=Guess Who's Been Coming to Dinner?

===Business===
Social exchange theory has served as a theoretical foundation to explain different situations in business practices. It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships and [[relationship marketing]]. The investment model proposed by [[Caryl Rusbult]] is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer's own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they pour additional resources into the relationship to salvage their initial investment. Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt; According to the study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determine if their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt;

===Work settings===
A study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Antecedents and consequences of employee engagement'|last = Saks|first = A.M.|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology  |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=600–19 |doi=10.1108/02683940610690169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship behavior===
Social exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for [[organizational citizenship behavior]].This study examines a model of clear leadership and relational building between head and teachers as antecedents, and organizational citizenship behavior as a consequence of teacher–school exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13603124.2010.524250|title=Social exchange theory as an explanation of organizational citizenship behaviour among teachers|journal=International Journal of Leadership in Education|volume=14|issue=4|pages=405–421|year=2011|last1=Elstad|first1=Eyvind|last2=Christophersen|first2=Knut Andreas|last3=Turmo|first3=Are}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship behavior can also be shown with employees and their employers.This is shown through organizational identification which plays an important role in organizational citizenship behavior. An employees identification with their employer plays a significant role in supporting and promoting organized citizenship behavior, serving as a mediating mechanism with citizenship behaviors, perceived organizational justice, and organizational support based on both the social exchange and social identity theory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=a3cc9152-d3aa-47c0-b0ac-93649c113f1e@sessionmgr4007&amp;bdata=#AN=126015861&amp;db=bft|title=Help yourself by helping others: The joint impact of group member organizat...: Discover @ Georgia Southern|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tinti|first=Joel Adame|last2=Venelli-Costa|first2=Luciano|last3=Vieira|first3=Almir Martins|last4=Cappellozza|first4=Alexandre|last5=Tinti|first5=Joel Adame|last6=Venelli-Costa|first6=Luciano|last7=Vieira|first7=Almir Martins|last8=Cappellozza|first8=Alexandre|date=December 2017|title=The impact of human resources policies and practices on organizational citizenship behaviors|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1808-23862017000600636&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=BBR.

===Online social networking and self-disclosure===
Understanding interpersonal disclosure in online social networking is an ideal application of social networking theory. Researchers have leveraged SET to explain self-disclosure in a cross-cultural context of French and British working professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posey | first1 = Clay | last2 = Benjamin Lowry | first2 = Paul | last3 = Roberts | first3 = Tom L. | last4 = Ellis | first4 = Selwyn | year = 2010 | title = Proposing the online community self-disclosure model: The case of working professionals in France and the UK who use online communities | ssrn = 1501447 | journal = European Journal of Information Systems | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 181–195 | doi = 10.1057/ejis.2010.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discover that reciprocation is the primary benefit of self-disclosure, whereas risk is the foundational cost of self-disclosure. They find that positive social influence to use an online community increases online community self-disclosure; reciprocity increases self-disclosure; online community trust increases self-disclosure; and privacy risk beliefs decrease self-disclosure. Meanwhile, a tendency toward collectivism increases self-disclosure. Similar research also leveraged SET to examine privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self-disclosure technologies in the context of instant messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin Lowry | first1 = Paul | last2 = Cao | first2 = Jinwei | last3 = Everard | first3 = Andrea | year = 2011 | title = Privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self-disclosure technologies: The case of instant messaging in two cultures | ssrn = 1668113 | journal = Journal of Management Information Systems | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 163–200 | doi = 10.2753/MIS0742-1222270406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was also a cross-cultural study, but instead compared US and Chinese participants.

==Affect theory==

The actors in social exchange are normally viewed as unemotional beings who have information, cognitively process it, and make decisions concerning the pattern and nature of exchange with others.&lt;ref name=Lawler /&gt; Affect theory of social exchange complements social exchange theory by incorporating [[emotion]] as part of the exchange process. Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks).&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=10.1086/324071 |doi=10.1086/324071|title=An Affect Theory of Social Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=2|pages=321–352|year=2001|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship.

===Assumptions===

Most social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and [[affect theory]]:

*There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange.
*Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative
*Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value).
*Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange.
*Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them.
*Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity.

===Theoretical propositions===

Affect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims:

'''Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses'''

Individuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful.  These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions.

'''Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions'''

Individuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange.

'''The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced'''

The [[Social exchange theory#Comparison levels|mode of exchange]] (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.

'''The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups'''

The different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual’s attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange.&lt;ref name="Lawler" /&gt; Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any [[self-serving bias]]es and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Lawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange.&lt;ref name="Lawler" /&gt; Following Weiner (1985)&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548–73|year=1985|last1=Weiner|first1=Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties'''

Repeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Spatial reconnaissance''', or "space reconnaissance", is the [[reconnaissance]] of any celestial bodies in space by use of spacecraft and [[satellite photography]].  NASA personnel utilizes space reconnaissance to scout other planets, military uses space reconnaissance by using spy satellites onto the Earth's surface.  Space reconnaissance assets provide access to all parts of the globe and use a variety of sensors to collect information responsive to virtually every intelligence need.  They also constitute an integral part of the U.S. military force structure, providing critical information with sufficient accuracy and timeliness to support the maneuver of military forces and the targeting of their weapons.

Space reconnaissance is also very expensive. Although procured in limited numbers, the large satellite systems developed by the United States and the ground stations needed to operate them require expenditures in the range of several billions of dollars per year.  Their substantial cost puts great pressure on the Intelligence Community to search for alternatives, find efficiencies, and continuously scrutinize the intelligence requirements these systems address.

'''Stockholm syndrome''' is a condition that causes [[kidnapping|hostages]] to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jameson|first=Celia | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=The Short Step From Love to Hypnosis: A Reconsideration of the Stockholm Syndrome|url=|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=14.4|pages=337–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alliances, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. &lt;!--Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other."&lt;ref name = "McKenzie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McKenzie | first = Ian K. | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Stockholm Syndrome Revisited | journal = Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations | date = 23 February 2004 | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–21 | doi = 10.1300/J173v04n01_02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's]] Hostage Barricade Database System and [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]] shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sundaram | first = Chandar S. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Stockholm Syndrome | journal = Salem Press Encyclopedia | via = Research Starters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G.

This term was first used by foreign media in 1973 as [[Eponym|eponym]] when four hostages were taken during [[Norrmalmstorg robbery|a bank robbery]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hostages defended their captors after being released and would not agree to testify in court against them.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adorjan | first1 = Michael | first2 = Tony | last2 = Christensen | first3 = Benjamin | last3 = Kelly | first4 = Dorothy | last4 = Pawluch | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome As Vernacular Resource | journal = The Sociological Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | year = 2012 | pages = 454–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm syndrome is ostensibly paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain an onlooker may feel towards the captors.

There are four key components that generally lead to the development of Stockholm syndrome: 
* A hostage's development of positive feelings towards their captor
* No previous hostage-captor relationship
* A refusal by hostages to co-operate with police forces and other government authorities
* A hostage's belief in the humanity of their captor, for the reason that when a victim holds the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="McKenzie_2004" /&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013" /&gt;

Stockholm syndrome is considered a "contested illness", due to many law enforcement officers' doubt about the legitimacy of the condition.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has also come to describe the reactions of some abuse victims beyond the context of kidnappings or hostage-taking. Actions and attitudes similar to those suffering from Stockholm syndrome have also been found in victims of [[sexual abuse]], [[human trafficking]], discrimination, terror, and political and religious oppression.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt;

==History==
=== Stockholm bank robbery ===
{{Main|Norrmalmstorg robbery}}
In 1973, [[Jan-Erik Olsson]], a convict on parole, took four employees of the bank (three women and one man) hostage during a failed bank robbery in [[Kreditbanken]], one of the largest banks in Stockholm, Sweden. He negotiated the release from prison of his friend [[Clark Olofsson]] to assist him. They held the hostages captive for six days (23–28 August) in one of the bank’s vaults. When they were released, none of them would testify against either captor in court; instead they began raising money for their defense.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; 

[[Nils Bejerot]], a Swedish [[criminologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] coined the term after [[Swedish Police|Stockholm police]] asked him for assistance with analyzing the victims' reactions to the 1973 bank robbery and their status as hostages. As the idea of [[brainwashing]] was not a new concept, Bejerot, speaking on "a news cast after the captives' release" instinctively reduced the hostages' reactions to a result of being brainwashed by their captors.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; He called it ''Norrmalmstorgssyndromet'', meaning "The Norrmalmstorg Syndrome"; it later became known outside of Sweden as the Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nilsbejerot.se/sexdagar_eng.htm |vauthors=Bejerot N |title=The six day war in Stockholm |journal=New Scientist |date=1974 |volume=61 |issue=886 |pages=486–487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally defined by psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]] to aid the management of hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Ochberg F |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/08/opinion/oe-ochberg8 |title=The Ties That Bind Captive to Captor |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsson later said in an interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the hostages' fault. They did everything I told them to. If they hadn't, I might not be here now. Why didn't any of them attack me? They made it hard to kill. They made us go on living together day after day, like goats, in that filth. There was nothing to do but get to know each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22447726|title=What is Stockholm syndrome?|last=Westcott|first=Kathryn | name-list-format = vanc |date=22 August 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other famous examples ===

==== Mary McElroy ====
[[Mary McElroy (kidnapping victim)|Mary McElroy]] was abducted from her home at age 25 by four men who held a gun to her, demanded her compliance, took her to an abandoned farmhouse, and chained her to a wall. She defended her kidnappers when she was released, explaining that they were only businessmen. She then continued to visit her captors while they were in jail. She eventually committed suicide and left the following note: “My four kidnappers are probably the only people on Earth who don't consider me an utter fool. You have your death penalty now – so, please, give them a chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/lady-kidnappers-article-1.396520 | title = Justice Story: The lady and her kidnappers | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 11 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natascha Kampusch ====
[[Natascha Kampusch]] was kidnapped at age ten and kept in an insulated, dark room under the garage of Wolfgang Priklopil. She would receive a variation of kind, physically and sexually abusive, controlling, and permissive treatment from her captor. Eight years after her kidnapping, Natascha left and Priklopil committed suicide. After her kidnapper's death, Natascha lamented and kept a picture of him in her wallet.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |website= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''. Retrieved 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxRCnoa9Aw Abductee Natascha Kampusch speaks out about her 8 years in captivity], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Patty Hearst ====
[[Patty Hearst]], the granddaughter of publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], was taken and held hostage by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], "an urban guerilla group", in 1974. She was recorded denouncing her family as well as the police under her new name, "Tania", and was later seen working with the SLA to rob banks in San Francisco. She publicly asserted her sympathetic feelings towards the SLA and their pursuits as well. After her 1975 arrest, pleading Stockholm syndrome did not work as a proper defense in court, much to the chagrin of her defense lawyer, [[F. Lee Bailey]]. Her seven-year prison sentence was later commuted, and she was eventually presidentially pardoned by [[Bill Clinton]], who was informed that she was not acting under her own free will.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt;

==== Colleen Stan ====
In 1977, [[Kidnapping of Colleen Stan|Colleen Stan]] was hitchhiking to visit a friend in southern California when she was kidnapped by Cameron Hooker and his wife Janice and forced to live in a wooden restraining box underneath their bed. For seven years she was repeatedly raped and tortured by Cameron and forced to live life as a sort of domestic/sex slave. Even though she was allowed to socialize with Janice and even visit her mother, she still continued to live in the box and did not attempt to escape. She was eventually freed by Janice, who asked Stan to not disclose her abuse as Janice was attempting to reform Cameron. Stan remained silent until Janice finally decided to turn Cameron over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/girl-box-article-1.1715494 | title=Hitchhiker kept as sex slave for seven years as 'Girl in the Box' | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual abuse victims ===
There is evidence that some victims of ''childhood sexual abuse'' come to feel a connection with their abuser. They often feel flattered by the adult attention or are afraid that disclosure will create family disruption. In adulthood, they resist disclosure for emotional and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jülich | first = Shirley | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome and Child Sexual Abuse | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–129 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1300/J070v14n03_06 | pmid = 16203697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lima syndrome===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
A similar form of Stockholm syndrome called ''Lima syndrome'' has been proposed, in which abductors develop sympathy for their hostages. An abductor may also have second thoughts or experience empathy towards their victims.

Lima syndrome was named after [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|an abduction at the Japanese embassy]] in [[Lima]], Peru, in 1996, when members of a militant movement took hostage hundreds of people attending a party at the official residence of Japan's ambassador. Within a few hours, the abductors had set free most of the hostages, including the most valuable ones, because of sympathy towards them.&lt;ref name=ptsd&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kato N, Kawata M, Pitman RK | title=PTSD |year=2006 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FUOHCwnHFKUC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Lima+Syndrome%22 |isbn = 978-4-431-29566-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Tansa|last= Musa  | name-list-format = vanc  | title = Africa Politics | url = http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/07/africa-politics-rwandas-revenge/ |work=[[International Press Service]] |date=10 July 1996 |access-date=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms and behaviours ==
{{Original research section|date=October 2016}}
Victims of the formal definition of Stockholm syndrome develop "positive feelings toward their captors and sympathy for their causes and goals, and negative feelings toward the police or authorities".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These symptoms often follow escaped victims back into their previously ordinary lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/coping-after-captivity/384577/|title=Coping After Captivity|last=Giambrone|first=Andrew | name-list-format = vanc |work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical and psychological effects ===

# Cognitive: confusion, blurred memory, refusal to accept the reality of events and recurring flashbacks.
# Emotional: lack of feeling, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, aggression, depression, guilt, dependence on captor and development of posttraumatic stress disorder. 
# Social: anxiety, irritability, cautiousness and estrangement. 
# Physical: increase in effects of pre-existing conditions; development of health conditions due to possible restriction from food, sleep, and exposure to outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander DA, Klein S | title = Kidnapping and hostage-taking: a review of effects, coping and resilience | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19147852 | pmc = 2627800 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2008.080347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping mechanism ===
From a psychoanalytic lens, it can be argued that Stockholm syndrome arises strictly as a result of survival instincts. Strentz states, "the victim’s need to survive is stronger than his impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma." A positive emotional bond between captor and captive is a "defense mechanism of the ego under stress".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These sentimental feelings are not strictly for show, however. Since captives often fear that their affection will be perceived as fake, they eventually begin to believe that their positive sentiments are genuine. The conception of Stockholm syndrome has grown to include victims of kidnappings or hostage instances, domestic or child abuse, human trafficking, incest, prisoners of war, political terrorism, cult members, concentration camp prisoners, slaves, and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; It is believed that women are especially prone to developing the condition.&lt;ref name = "Åse_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Åse|first1=Cecilia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Crisis Narratives and Masculinist Protection|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|date=22 May 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=595–610|doi=10.1080/14616742.2015.1042296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, Stockholm syndrome develops in captives when they engage in "face-to-face contact" with their captors, and when captors make captives doubt the likelihood of their survival by terrorizing them into "helpless, powerless, and submissive" states. This enables captors to appear merciful when they perform acts of kindness or fail to "beat, abuse, or rape" the victims.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Ideas like "dominance hierarchies and submission strategies" assist in devising explanations for the illogical reasoning behind the symptoms of those suffering from Stockholm syndrome as a result of any oppressive relationship.&lt;ref name="Åse_2015" /&gt; Partial activation of the capture-bonding psychological trait may lie behind [[battered woman syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=October 2016}}{{cite book|first=Libb|last=Thims | name-list-format = vanc |title=Human Chemistry (Volume Two)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC|year=2007 |publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4303-2840-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC&amp;pg=PA604&amp;dq=%25captive–bonding%25+%25battered–wife+syndrome%25 604–605]}}&lt;/ref&gt; military basic training, fraternity [[hazing]], and sex practices such as [[BDSM|sadism/masochism or bondage/discipline]].&lt;ref name="hkhenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Keith | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War |journal=Mankind Quarterly |date=Summer 2006 |volume=46 |issue=4 |url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |authorlink=Keith Henson |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209044509/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |access-date=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible evolutionary explanations ====

Evolutionarily speaking, research evidence exists to support the genuine scientific nature of Stockholm syndrome. Responses similar to those in human captives have been detected in some reptiles and mammals, primates in particular. Abuse and subsequent submission and appeasement by the victim have been observed among chimpanzees, leading to the theory that the Stockholm syndrome may have its roots in evolutionary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantor C, Price J | title = Traumatic entrapment, appeasement and complex post-traumatic stress disorder: evolutionary perspectives of hostage reactions, domestic abuse and the Stockholm syndrome | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 377–84 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17464728 | doi = 10.1080/00048670701261178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the "environment of evolutionary adaptiveness" ([[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|EEA]]) is thought by researchers such as Israeli military historian [[Azar Gat]] to be similar to that of the few remaining hunter-gatherer societies, who asserts that war and abductions were typical of human pre-history.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-scribd-10|&lt;sup&gt;[10&lt;/sup&gt;]] Being captured by neighbouring tribes was a relatively common event for women. In some of those tribes ([[Yanomamo]], for instance), practically everyone in the tribe is descended from a captive within the last three generations. As high as one in ten of females were abducted and incorporated into the tribe that captured them.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-hkhenson-15|&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;]]Being captured[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] and having their children killed may have been common;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] women who resisted capture risked being killed.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-13|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] When [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is intense and persistent, adaptive traits (such as capture-bonding) become universal to the population or species.

==== Loving to survive ====
First published in 1994, author Dee Graham uses the Stockholm syndrome label to describe group or collective responses to trauma, rather than individual reactions. Graham focuses specifically on the impact of Stockholm syndrome on battered and abused women as a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://violentadegen.ro/wp-content/uploads/Loving-to-Survive-Graham.pdf|title=Loving to Survive|last=Graham|first=Dee L. R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]She claimed that in both the psychological and societal senses, these women are defined by their sense of fear surrounding the threat of male violence. This constant fear is what drives these women to perform actions that they know will be pleasing to men in order to avoid emotional, physical, or sexual assault as a result of male anger. Graham draws parallels between women and kidnapping victims in the sense that these women bond to men to survive, as captives bond to their captors to survive.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Recovery ===
Recovering from Stockholm syndrome ordinarily involves "psychiatric or psychological counseling," where the patient is helped to realize that their actions and feelings stemmed from inherent human survival techniques. The process of recovery includes reinstating normalcy into the lives of victims, including helping the victim learn how to decrease their survival-driven behaviors.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:24-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref name="Åse_2015"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
=== Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM5, 2013) ===
This book is widely used as the "classification system for psychological disorders" by the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has not historically appeared in the manual, as many believe it falls under [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Before the fifth edition (DSM5) was released, Stockholm syndrome was under consideration to be included under 'Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified'.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; The work was updated in 2013, but Stockholm syndrome was not present.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | author = American Psychiatry Association | title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5 | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | location = Washington | isbn = 978-0-89042-555-8 | edition = 5th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Namnyak, Tufton, Szekely, Toal, Worboys and Sampson (2008) ===
Researchers have found that although there is a lot of media coverage of Stockholm syndrome, there has not been a lot of professional research into the phenomena. What little research has been done is often contradictory and does not always agree on what Stockholm syndrome is. The term has grown beyond kidnappings to all kinds of abuse. Also, there is no clear definition of symptoms to ‘diagnose’ the ‘syndrome’.&lt;ref name="Namnyak_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Namnyak M, Tufton N, Szekely R, Toal M, Worboys S, Sampson EL | title = 'Stockholm syndrome': psychiatric diagnosis or urban myth? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18028254 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin (1999) ===
A report by the FBI found that only 8% of kidnapping victims showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. The sensational nature of dramatic cases causes the public to perceive this phenomenon as the rule rather than the exception. For Stockholm syndrome to happen, FBI researchers have identified three key factors: the passage of time, continual contact, and small acts of kindness without direct and persistent abuse.&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G. Dwayne | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 1999|title=Placing the Stockholm Syndrome in Perspective|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/fbi/stockholm_syndrome.pdf|journal=[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]]|volume=68|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Robbins and Anthony (1982) ===
Robbins and Anthony, who had historically studied a condition similar to Stockholm syndrome, known as destructive cult disorder, observed in their 1982 study that the 1970s were rich with apprehension surrounding the potential risks of brainwashing. They assert that brainwashing’s media attention during this time resulted in the fluid reception of Stockholm syndrome as a psychological condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Elizabeth Aileen| name-list-format = vanc |date=31 December 2012|title=The use of the "Brainwashing" Theory by the Anti-cult Movement in the United States of America, pre-1996|url=http://journals.openedition.org/zjr/387|journal=Zeitschrift für Junge Religionswissenschaft | language=en|issue=7|doi=10.4000/zjr.387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims ===
It is possible that the label Stockholm syndrome is used too freely in cases in which it may not apply. [[Elizabeth Smart]] has been held as a classic example of Stockholm syndrome; however, she denies that she ever had any emotional attachment to her abusers. Although she chose not to run away when she had the chance, she emphasized that the threats from her captors to her and her family, and the direct presence of her captors influenced her decision to stay. Once freed from her captors, she gladly reunited with her family and felt no empathy for her abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | last= McLaughlin | first = Christen Marie | degree = Bachelor of Science | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fear or Love: Examining Stockholm Syndrome in the Elizabeth Smart Kidnapping case | date = 2015 | publisher = Salem State University | url = http://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/honors_theses/72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films and television===
* In the 1977 TV series ''[[Lou Grant (season 1)|Lou Grant]]'', episode ''Hostages''. The hostage negotiator mentions Stockholm syndrome to Lou when hostage Carla Mardigian goes back after hostage taker lets her go to the toilet.
*In the opening sequence of ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), James Bond is "killed" in a training exercise by a prisoner he has released, since he doesn't anticipate that she might be suffering from Stockholm syndrome. This condition is also mentioned in The World is Not Enough, where Bond accuses Elektra King of having romantic feelings for her captor, Renard.
*In ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), a book author, Dr. Hasseldorf, expresses his view that "by this time, the hostages should be going through the early stages of the Helsinki syndrome," an error compounded by news reporter Harvey Johnson's reply of "As in Helsinki, Sweden."
*In ''[[Babylon 5]]'''s 8th episode of Season 4, ''[[The Illusion of Truth]]'' (1997), Dr. Indiri states that [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Sheridan]] is suffering from Helsinki syndrome.
*In the animated series ''[[Black Lagoon]]'', it is often contemplated by the protagonist whether or not he has Stockholm syndrome after he joins the pirates as a former hostage.
* In the second episode of [[Red Dwarf XII|Series XII]] of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Siliconia]]'' (2017), the leader of the Mechanoid Intergalactic Liberation Front known as Wind suggests to [[Kryten]] that he is suffering from Stockholm syndrome based on his professed affection for his shipmates despite his seeming servitude.
* In the Spanish TV series [[Money Heist]] (Casa de Papel, 2017), all of the captors are nicknamed for cities -- Tokyo, Berlin, etc.  One of the hostages falls in love with one of the captors and joins them, earning her the nickname Stockholm.

===Other media===
*In music, many bands have published [[Stockholm syndrome (disambiguation)#songs|songs titled "Stockholm Syndrome"]], such as [[Yo La Tengo]], [[blink-182]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], and [[One Direction]]. Japanese-British singer [[Rina Sawayama]] has also released a song "Cyberstockholm Syndrome" based on the condition with an Internet-technological theme of online relationships. 
*In the video game ''[[Payday 2]]'', there is an available skill in the "Mastermind" tree called Stockholm Syndrome, which gives civilians (who are typically held hostage if not freed by police units or left unattended long enough) a chance to revive downed players and give them more weapon ammunition.

'''Sustainability measurement''' is the quantitative basis for the informed management of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-357-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T. et al. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Simon  and Morse, Stephen 2008. ''Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable?'' 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-299-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]]. An alternative approach, used by the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is [[Circles of Sustainability]].

==Sustainability indicators and their function==
The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Boulanger, P. M. (2008) "Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue". '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The [[European Environment Agency]] uses a slight modification of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] [[DPSIR]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stanners, D. et al. 2007. ''Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA.'' In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) ''(D)rive'' or initiate environmental ''(P)ressures'' which, in turn, produces a change in the ''(S)tate'' of the environment which leads to ''(I)mpacts'' of various kinds. Societal ''(R)esponses'' (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.

==Metrics at the global scale==

===United Nations Indicators===
The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/isd.htm] United Nations sustainable development indicators&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp], [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.===
In the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability — including measures of resource use like [[life cycle assessment]], measures of consumption like the [[ecological footprint]] and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the [[Environmental Performance Index]]. The following is a list of quantitative "tools" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.

===Resource metrics===
Part of this process can relate to resource use such as [[energy accounting]] or to economic metrics or [[price system]] values as compared to [[non-market economics]] potential, for understanding resource use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Net_energy_analysis |title=Net energy analysis |publisher=Eoearth.org |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important task for resource theory ([[energy economics]]) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision Making, Science, and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - A Useful Concept.Intro |publisher=Exergy.se |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the [[Industrial Revolution]], and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_and_economic_myths_(historical) |title=Energy and economic myths (historical) |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics, oil and energy====
[[Image:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.

Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to [[Ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

====Growth-based economic models====

Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. [[M. King Hubbert]] believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html How peak oil could lead to starvation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818060558/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and [[Mario Giampietro]], senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taggart |first=Adam |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The [[Peak oil|peaking of global oil]] along with the decline in regional [[natural gas]] production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbert peaks==
Although [[Hubbert peak theory]] receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley (p.&amp;nbsp;189) predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview
|first=R.W. |last=Bentley |journal=Energy Policy |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=189–205 |year=2002 |url=http://www.oilcrisis.com/bentley/depletionOverview.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(01)00144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the USA, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html GEO 3005: Earth Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085800/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted—far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Rosie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml" /&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41].
&lt;/ref&gt; This
implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

Finally, insofar as global [[peak oil]] and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, considerably extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025195932/http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.}}

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063107/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Metals===

Hubbert applied his theory to "rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976 |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and others would occur in the time frame of decades and [[iron]] in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007].

Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources.  However [[over-exploitation]] often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless.  A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive.  The term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

===Renewable resources===

'''Thích Quảng Độ''' (born 27 November 1928) is a Vietnamese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] and patriarch of the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], a currently banned religious body in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/burn-02172012185416.html Self-Immolation 'Only Possible Recourse'], RFA, 2012-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group [[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]], which he shared with [[Thích Huyền Quang]] and [[Thadeus Nguyễn Văn Lý]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|title=Previous Recipients of the Homo Homini Award|publisher=[[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]]|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501192644/http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Thích Quảng Độ was born in the [[Thái Bình Province]] of North Vietnam, at 14 he became a monk. At age 17 he witnessed his religious master executed by the revolutionary People's Tribunal.

===Political opposition===
While a member of the leadership of the UBCV, Thích Quảng Độ became an activist, fighting against the anti-Buddhist policies of [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].  After a police raid of Buddhist monasteries in Hue and Saigon, Quảng Độ was arrested on  August 20, 1963. He and thousands of other Buddhists endured torture and persecution while imprisoned by the Diem government. As a result of imprisonment, Độ struggled with [[tuberculosis]] before having a lung operation.

In 1975 Vietnam was under communist control, and the UBCV was once again unwelcome in Vietnam. As a result, the UBCV facilities were seized, and documents burned. Quảng Độ was active in protesting the governments actions, and after attempting to gather Buddhists from other regions in non-violent opposition, he was arrested on charges of anti-revolutionary activities and undermining national solidarity. He spent  20 months at the Phan Dang Luu Prison in solitary confinement, before he was trialed and released in December, 1978. Later that year  he was nominated by Betty Williams and [[Mairead Maguire]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="Que me"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile on Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, Head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam|url=http://www.queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|work=Biography|publisher=Que me|accessdate=24 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125093252/http://queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the Vietnamese Government created a Buddhist alternative, called the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was state sponsored and controlled by the [[Vietnam Fatherland Front]].  Because of Quảng Độ's opposition to the new church, he was again jailed. Quảng Độ would spend the next 10 years in exile in the village of Vu Doai.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

Yet again in 1995, while attempting to expose government abuse of the UBCV, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

Thích Quảng Độ became the President of the UBCV's Institute for the Dissemination of the Dharma in 1999, meaning that he was the second-ranking UBCV dignitary after patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. In 2008, as one of his last wishes Patriarch Quang named Thích Quảng Độ as the new patriarch of the  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 2001, Thích Quảng Độ received the Hellman-Hammet Award for persecuted writers.

In 2002, Thích Quảng Độ, together with Father Nguyễn Văn Lý, received Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network.

In 2003, Thích Quảng Độ was honored with the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need, which he shared with Thích Huyền Quảng and Father Nguyễn Văn Lý.&lt;ref&gt; Martin Hrobský (11-04-2003). [https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/homo-homini-awards-recognize-the-work-of-three-vietnamese-activists Homo Homini Awards recognize the work of three Vietnamese activists], Czech Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was awarded the [[Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize]], in recognition of "personal courage and perseverance through three decades of peaceful opposition against the communist regime in Vietnam, and as a symbol for the growing democracy movement". Thích Quảng Độ was unable to the receive the award, as the government prevented him from attending the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;The Rafto Foundation, [https://www.rafto.no/the-rafto-prize/thich-quang-do 2006 Laureate Thích Quảng Độ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was also awarded the Democracy Courage Tribute by the World Movement for Democracy.

In January 2008, the Europe-based magazine ''[[A Different View]]'' chose Độ as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy. Others in the list include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Corazon Aquino]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">'''Transnational Barrios''' as a concept within [[Latin America]]n and [[Latino]] studies explains the social construction of space, place, culture, traditions, and artistic symbolic meanings that are established beyond national boundaries by diverse Latina/o populations in communities of a hosting country. Therefore '''Transnational Barrios''' are seen by scholars as critical spaces to celebrate and embrace cultural production, political mobilizations, [[ethnic identity]] and [[solidarity]], and develop a sense of belonging within communities. 

''Transnational'' as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, is extending or going beyond national boundaries or consisting of persons from different nationalities.

According to Anthropologist ''Michael Kearney'', ''Transnational'' deals with forms of organization and identity of Latinas/os that are not restricted by national boundaries, meaning not being constraint by nation-state of origin in order to form a collective identity in a hosting country.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Michael. “Transnationalism in California and Mexico at the End of Empire,” In Border Identities: Nation and State at International Frontiers. Ed. Thomas W. Wilson and Hastings Connan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 117-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Barrio|''Barrios'']] refer to a part of an inner city area mostly composed of a Spanish-speaking population. “Both historically and today, barrio formations are the result of specific plans and policies on the local, state, and federal levels that have resulted in high levels of racial segregation, substandard and limited housing stock, poor schooling, and severely circumscribed mobility.”&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as ''Gina M. Perez'', ''Frank A. Guridy'', and ''Adrian Burgos Jr.'' believe that one must use the ''transnational'' approach in Latin American and Latino Studies to create a framework that will better apprehend the diverse experiences of Latinas/os in multiple contexts. As well as confronting the negative notions of ''Barrios'' as being places of social dislocation, and marginalized and criminalized locations. '''Transnational Barrios''' therefore strive to create and progress through new meanings, experiences, and identities of diverse and compelling Latina/o populations of various communities throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Transnational Barrios==
An example of a '''Transnational Barrio''' is explained in ''Cary Cordova’s'' article “''The Mission in Nicaragua''”&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Cary. “The Mission in Nicaragua,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; in regards to the Nicaraguan community in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] of San Francisco. Nicaraguans in the U.S. mobilized in the 1970s during the ''[[Sandinista]] revolution'' to rally support for the overthrow of the current oppressive regime of ''[[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]]''. They believed that if the Sandinistas succeeded then Nicaragua would become a model for freedom and equality around the world, including the U.S. As citizens in Nicaragua were struggling with control over their own lives, so too were Nicaraguans in the U.S. due to the lack of social reforms needed by the community, mainly because of U.S. capitalism. Artists and activists used the ideas of the Nicaraguan revolution to express the political needs of Latinos in ''San Francisco'' and the Americas. Poets such as ''Alejandro Murguia, Roberto Vargas and Nina Serrano'' accomplished this by creating events such as poetry readings, rallies, demonstrations, and the creation of murals to illustrate the struggles of people in Nicaragua and in the U.S. Cordova demonstrates that the barrio served as a ''transnational space'' where ideas such as revolution, liberation and equality and political mobilization and solidarity could be transformed and used together to fight the revolution abroad and fight the war on the home front.  

[[Lourdes Gutierrez Najera]] describes another example of using barrios as a ''transnational space'' with her study of Oaxacans in the city of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez Najera, Lourdes. “Hayandose,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; In her article "Hayandose", to maintain their Zapotec and Yalalteco indigenous identity, Oaxacans organize to aid one another in times of crisis such as in the viewing of a young Oaxacan individual where a traditional Oaxacan funeral ceremony was conducted in the Koreatown district of Los Angeles. Such practices demonstrate that their strong ties are established and maintained with their hometowns. Given the marginality of indigenous people both in Mexico and the U.S. they create a space of inclusion and belonging by practicing the same customs that they perform in Oaxaca. Traditional Oaxacan dances and festivals known as ''[[Guelaguetza|Guelaguetza's]]'' are as well an important means to celebrate their indigenous roots and reaffirm their ethnic membership within transnational borders. This folkloric dance along with the other customs Zapotecs and Yalaltecos bring with them, situate their barrio as a transnational space.

[[Nuyorican Movement|''The Nuyorican poetry movement'']] of the 1970s in Manhattan’s Lower Eastside is one more example of a '''Transnational Barrio'''.  The Nuyorican movement was seen as a venue for spoken word performances, stand-up comedy, poetry slams, musical performances and theater productions. The use of code switching between Spanish and English demonstrated the concern for the low income, poor experience of life in New York for Puerto Ricans, which strongly made visible the political motivation behind the poetry movement. ''Miguel Algarin, Miguel Pinero, Bittman “Bimbo” Rivas and Lucky Cienfuegos'' were among the creators and poets of the movement in the 1970s along with other poets such as ''Bob Holman, Saul Williams, Sarah Jones, and Beau Sia''. The transnational space created in the barrios of Manhattan’s Lower Eastside provide New York Puerto Ricans, or as they called themselves Nuyoricans, a chance to mobilize leftist ideals in their poetry, art performances and literature.

'''Truth claim''', in photography, is a term [[Tom Gunning]] uses to describe the prevalent belief that traditional photographs accurately depict reality. He states that the truth claim relies on both the [[indexicality]] and visual accuracy of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Peirce]]'s term 'indexicality' refers to the physical relationship between the object photographed and the resulting image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Levinson]] emphasises the ability of photography to capture or reflect "a literal energy configuration from the real world" through a chemical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light sensitive emulsion on the [[Negative (photography)|photographic negative]] is transformed by light passing [[Through-the-lens|through the lens]] and diaphragm of a camera.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson relates this characteristic of the photograph to its objectivity and reliability, echoing Andre Bazin's belief that photography is free from the "sin" of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=40, 41, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument has been made for motion pictures by Stephen Maguire. [[Lev Manovich]] labels cinema ''the art of the index'', its traditional identity lying in its ability to capture reality.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lev Manovich |title=What is digital cinema? |url=http://www.manovich.net/text/digital-cinema |year=1995 |accessdate=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis McQuail]] likewise argues that film is capable of manipulating the "...seeming reality of the photographic message without loss of credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McQuail|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual accuracy==
Gunning states that a photograph must also have "iconicity". To represent "truth" it must resemble the object it represents, which is not an inevitable characteristic of an index.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

==Consequences of the "truth claim"==

===For individuals===
Levinson suggests that icons have a powerful effect on individuals, particularly the "direct image" due to the "sheer ease and [[sensual]] satisfaction" of viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=37, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning attributes the human fascination with photographs with a sense of the relationship between photography and reality, though he claims that the "perceptual richness and nearly infinite detail" of the image itself is more significant than a knowledge of its indexicality. He cites Bazin's idea that photography has an "irrational power to bear away our [[faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Susan Sontag]] relates the belief in a photograph's ability to capture 'reality' to the development of certain human practices. Since a picture confers on events "a kind of immortality (and importance) it would never otherwise have enjoyed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; she explains, the act of taking photographs has become essential to the experience of [[Travel|world travel]]. The possibility of 'true' photographs leads to a compulsion to "[convert] experience into an image" to "make real what one is experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For society===

====Understanding of reality====
David Croteau and William Hoynes suggest that the prevalence of photographic images has blurred the distinction between image and reality, referring to ''pseudo-events'', in Daniel Boorstin's words – such as [[News conference|press conferences]], televised political debates, or 'photo opportunities' - that exist only to create images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Neil Postman]] argues that the photograph has redefined society's understanding of information and truth: "Truth is in the seeing, not in the thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postman suggests that the proliferation of photography led to the replacement of language with images as "our dominant means for constructing, understanding, and testing reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Postman|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sontag shares this view, suggesting that "the 'realistic' view of the world compatible with bureaucracy redefines knowledge as ''techniques of information''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social organisation====
In Sontag's view, a consequence of photography becoming a primary means for understanding reality is the emergence of "[[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] cataloguing". She claims that photography's perceived ability to give information results in the bureaucratic organization of modern states. Institutions of control, such as the police, are able to survey and control "increasingly mobile populations" through photographic documents, such as passports or identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=5, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desensitization====
Sontag also argues that through repeatedly capturing and viewing reality through photographs, their subjects can become less real. She claims that "aesthetic distance seems built into the very experience of looking at photographs," and also that the sheer volume of horrific images throughout the world has produced a "familiarity with atrocity, making the horrible seem more ordinary – making it appear familiar, remote … inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyperreality====
Sontag's view is akin to Jean Baudrillard's theory of 'hyperreality', where "reality itself founders" as a result of an endless "reduplication of the real" via media such as photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the possibility of infinite identical objects creates a "relationship of equivalence, of indifference,"...leading to the "extinction of the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital photography==

It has been argued that the digitisation of photography undermines its ''truth claim''.

===Potential for manipulation===
Levinson suggests that the digitisation of photography undermines "the very reliability of the photograph as mute, unbiased witness of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the fallibility of [[photo manipulation|technological manipulation]] and the potential for human refinement of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lev Manovich likewise questions the indexical identity of motion pictures, rather labelling cinema a [[Genre|subgenre]] of painting, since it is possible to digitally modify frames, generate photorealistic images entirely using 3-D [[computer animation]], and "...to cut, bend, stretch and stitch digitised film images into something which has perfect photographic credibility, although it was never actually filmed."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

===Loss of indexicality===
It has also been argued that digital photographs inevitably lack indexicality, based on an understanding of "crucial distinctions between the analogue and the digital" in the way they record 'reality'.&lt;ref name="Lister_252"&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Frosh describes photographs as "codes without a message" – "repurposable visual content made of malleable info-pixels."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The continuing "reality effect"===
Gunning alternatively argues that [[digital photography]], the process of encoding data about light in a matrix of numbers, is indexically determined by objects outside of the camera like chemical photography.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Likewise, Martin Lister claims that even with a [[digital camera]], "The images produced are rendered [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]], they borrow photography's currency, its deeply historical 'reality effect', simply in order to have meaning."&lt;ref name="Lister_252"/&gt;

==Criticism of the "truth claim"==
[[Susan Sontag]] challenges the "presumption of veracity" associated with photographs, arguing that they are "...as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are." She describes the role of the photographer in determining the exposure, light, texture and geometry of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning points to the physicality of the camera as a mediator between the photograph and reality. He notes that the use of a lens, film, a particular exposure, kind of shutter, and developing process "...become magically whisked away if one considers the photograph as a direct imprint of reality."&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Sontag also describes the inability of a photograph to capture enough information about its subject to be considered a representation of reality. She states, "The camera's rendering of reality must always hide more than it discloses…only what which narrates can make us understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Roland Barthes]] notes that the [[Research subject|human subject]] can be made less real through the process of being photographed. He notes, "Once I feel myself observed by the lens, everything changes: I constitute myself in the process of 'posing', I instantaneously make another body for myself, transform myself in advance into an image."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthes|1982|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Porter|Kennedy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''veridicality''' is a [[semantic]] or [[grammar|grammatical]] assertion of the truth of an utterance. For example, the statement "Paul saw a snake" asserts the truthfulness of the claim, while "Paul ''did'' see a snake" is an even stronger assertion. [[Negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is veridical, though of opposite [[polarity (grammar)|polarity]], sometimes called ''antiveridical'': "Paul didn't see a snake" asserts that the statement "Paul saw a snake" is false.  In English, [[linguistic modality|non-indicative moods]] are frequently used in a nonveridical sense: "Paul may have seen a snake" and "Paul would have seen a snake" do not assert that Paul actually saw a snake (and the second implies that he did not), though "Paul would indeed have seen a snake" is veridical, and some languages have separate veridical [[conditional mood]]s for such cases.

== In semantic theory ==
The formal definition of veridicality views the context as a [[propositional operator]].

# A propositional operator ''F'' is veridical [[iff]] ''Fp'' entails ''p'': ''Fp'' → ''p''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
# Additionally, a nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff ''Fp'' entails ''not p'': ''Fp'' → ¬''p''.

For [[temporal logic#Temporal operators|temporal]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] operators, the definition of veridicality is somewhat more complex:

* For operators relative to instants of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an instant of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''.
* For operators relative to intervals of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an interval of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''.

=== Nonveridical operators ===
Nonveridical operators typically license the use of ''polarity items'', which in veridical contexts normally is ungrammatical:

: * John saw ''any'' students. (The context is veridical.)
: John didn't see ''any'' students. (The context is nonveridical.)

=== Downward entailment ===
All [[Downward entailment|downward entailing]] contexts are nonveridical. Because of this, theories based on nonveridicality can be seen as extending those based on downward entailment, allowing to explain more cases of PI licensing.

Downward entailment predicts that polarity items will be licensed in the scope of [[negation (linguistics)|negation]], downward entailing [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s like ''few N'', ''at most n N'', ''no N'', and the restriction of ''every'':

: No students saw ''anything''.
: John didn't see ''anything''.
: Few children saw ''anything''.
: Every student who saw ''anything'' should report to the police.

=== Non-monotone quantifiers ===
[[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifiers]] like ''exactly three students'', ''nobody but John'', and ''almost nobody'' are non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) but nevertheless admit ''any'':

: % Exactly three students saw ''anything''.
: Nobody but John saw ''anything''.
: Almost nobody saw ''anything''.

=== ''Hardly'' and ''barely'' ===
''Hardly'' and ''barely'' allow for ''any'' despite not being downward entailing.

: John hardly talked to ''anybody''. (Does not entail "John hardly talked to his mother".)
: John barely studied ''anything''. (Does not entail "John barely studied linguistics".)

=== Questions ===
Polarity items are quite frequent in [[question]]s, although questions are not monotone.

: Did you see ''anything''?

Although questions [[loaded question|biased]] towards the negative answer, such as "Do you &lt;nowiki&gt;[even]&lt;/nowiki&gt; give a damn about any books?" ([[tag question]]s based on negative sentences exhibit even more such bias), can sometimes be seen as downward entailing, this approach cannot account for the general case, such as the above example where the context is perfectly neutral. Neither can it explain why [[negative question]]s, which naturally tend to be biased, don't license negative polarity items.

In semantics which treats a question as the set of its true answers, the [[denotation]] of a polar question contains two possible answers:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Did you see John?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt; you saw John ∨ you didn't see John &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Because [[disjunction]] ''p'' ∨ ''q'' entails neither ''p'' nor ''q'', the context is nonveridical, which explains the admittance of ''any''.

=== Future ===
Polarity items appear in [[future tense|future]] sentences.

: John will buy ''any'' bottle of wine.
: The children will leave as soon as they discover ''anything''.

According to the formal definition of veridicality for temporal operators, future is nonveridical: that "John will buy a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' does not entail that "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true at any instant up to and including ''now''. On the other hand, [[past tense|past]] is veridical: that "John bought a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' entails that there is an instant preceding ''now'' at which "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true.

=== Habitual aspect ===
Likewise, nonveridicality of the [[habitual aspect]] licenses polarity items.

: He usually reads ''any'' book very carefully.

The habitual aspect is nonveridical because e.g., that "He is usually cheerful" is true over some interval of time does not entail that "He is cheerful" is true over every subinterval of that. This is in contrast to e.g., the [[progressive aspect]], which is veridical and prohibits negative polarity items.

=== Generic sentences ===
Non-monotone generic sentences accept polarity items.

: ''Any'' cat hunts mice.

=== Modal verbs ===
[[Modal verb]]s create generally good environments for polarity items:

: John may talk to ''anybody''.
: ''Any'' minors must be accompanied by their parents.
: The committee can give the job to ''any'' candidate.

Such contexts are nonveridical despite being non-monotone and sometimes even upward entailing ("John must tango" entails "John must dance").

=== Imperatives ===
[[Imperative mood|Imperatives]] are roughly parallel to modal verbs and intensional contexts in general.

: Take ''any'' apple. (cf. "You may/must take ''any'' apple", "I want you to take ''any'' apple".)

=== Protasis of conditionals ===
[[Protasis (linguistics)|Protasis]] of [[conditional sentence|conditionals]] is one of the most common environments for polarity items.

: If you sleep with ''anybody'', I'll kill you.

=== Directive intensional verbs ===
Polarity items are licensed with [[directive modality|directive]] [[propositional attitude]]s but not with [[epistemic]] ones.

: John would like to invite ''any'' student.
: John asked us to invite ''any'' student.
: * John believes that we invited ''any'' student.
: * John dreamt that we invited ''any'' student.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">'''Verification''' in the field of space systems engineering covers two [[Verification and validation|verification]] processes: Qualification and Acceptance

== Overview ==
In the field of spaceflight verification standards are developed by [[NASA]] and the [[European Cooperation for Space Standardization|ECSS]], and to specify requirements for the verification of a space system product, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/ESA/ECSS-E-10-02A_14991/ Space Engineering Verification], ECSS-E-10-02A, 17 November 1998, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the fundamental concepts of the verification process,
* the criteria for defining the verification strategy and
* the rules for the implementation of the verification programme.

Verification is one main reason that costs for space systems are high. All data are to be documented and to stay accessible for potential, later failure analyses. In previous times that approach was executed down to piece-parts level (resistors, switches etc.) whereas nowadays it is tried to reduce cost by usage of "CAM (Commercial, Avionics, Military) equipment" for non-safety relevant units.

== Qualification and Acceptance ==
Qualification is the formal proof that the design meets all [[requirements]] of the [[specification]] and the [[parameter]]s agreed in the [[Interface Control Document]]s (ICD) including tolerances due to manufacturing imperfections, wear-out within specified life-time, faults etc. The end of the qualification process is the approval signature of the customer on the Certificate of Qualification (COQ) agreeing that all his requirements are met.

Acceptance is the formal proof that the product identified by its serial number meets all requirements of the specification and is free of workmanship and material failures. Acceptance is based on the preceding qualification by reference to the used design / manufacturing documentation. The end of the acceptance process is the approval signature of the customer on the Certificate of Acceptance (COA) agreeing that all his requirements are met by the product to be delivered.

Qualification verification methods are
* Review of design using configuration controlled drawings (for software code review)
* Analysis
* Test (functions under specified environment, mass, dimensions etc.)
* Inspection (especially for Human Factors Engineering requirements with astronauts for manned spacecraft).
Each software element will be tested alone and as part of the overall system configuration until considered as qualified.

Acceptance verification methods are
* Test
* Inspection by Quality Assurance engineers.

'''Zero Waste''' is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of [[natural resource|resource]] life cycles so that all products are [[reused]]. The goal is for no trash to be sent to [[landfills]], [[incinerators]], or the ocean. The process recommended is one [[biomimetics|similar]] to the way that resources are reused in nature. The definition adopted by the ''Zero Waste International Alliance'' (ZWIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zwia.org/|title=Zero Waste International Alliance|author=|date=|website=zwia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zero Waste: The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of all products, packaging, and materials, without burning them, and without discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zero Waste refers to waste management and planning approaches which emphasize waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management.&lt;ref name=Snow&gt;{{cite web|author1=Snow, W. |author2=Dickinson J. |date=2001 |title=The end of waste: Zero waste by 2020|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through [[recycling]] and [[reuse]], it focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web |author=Davidson, G. |date=2011 |title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review|url=https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target.&lt;ref name=Spiegelman&gt;{{cite web|author=Spiegelman, H. |date=2006 |title=Transitioning to Zero Waste - What can local governments do NOW?|url=http://www.rcbc.ca/files/u3/PPI_Zero_Waste_and_Local_Govt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

Advocates expect that government regulation is needed&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design, manufacturing processes, and material selection.&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite journal |author=Townsend, W.

Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution, and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials.

== Cradle-to-cradle / cradle-to-grave ==

Cradle-to-grave is a term used to describe a linear model for materials that begins with resource extraction, moves to product manufacturing, and, ends by a ‘grave’, where the product is disposed of in a [[landfill]].  Cradle-to-grave is in direct contrast to cradle-to-cradle. [[Cradle-to-cradle]] is a term used in life-cycle analysis to describe a material or product that is recycled into a new product at the end of its life, so that ultimately there is no waste.&lt;ref name=McDonough&gt;{{cite web |author1=McDonough, W. |author2=Braungart, M. |date=2003 |title=The cradle-to-cradle alternative.|url=http://www.mcdonough.com/speaking-writing/the-cradle-to-cradle-alternative/#.UzxdSUlzZAg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradle-to-cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed loop cycles which mean fun that waste is minimized, and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle-to-cradle simply goes beyond dealing with issues of waste after it has been created, by addressing problems at the source and by re-defining problems by focusing on [[design]].&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;  The cradle-to-cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

The cradle-to-cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;  In the industrial sector, it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world, in which one organism’s ‘waste’, cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things, cradle-to-cradle materials circulate in closed-loop cycles, providing nutrients for nature or industry.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

An example of a closed loop, cradle-to-cradle product design is DesignTex Fabric. It has designed an upholstery fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, which is a blend of [[pesticide]]- and residue-free wool and organically grown [[ramie]], dyed and processed entirely with [[nontoxic]] chemicals.

== Problems ==

=== Social and economic ===

The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In 2012 the World Bank stated that 1.3billion tonnes of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that that number will reach 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 (Global Solid Waste Management Market - Analysis and Forecast). The increase in solid waste production increase the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non-white populations.  Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance.  Additionally, within the last five years, more than 400 hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stretesky|first=P.|last2=McKie|first2=R.|date=2016|title=A perspective on the historical analysis of race and treatment storage and disposal facilities in the United States.|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001/meta|journal=Environmental. Research. Letters.|volume=11|issue=3|pages=|via=|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment.[[Zero waste#cite note-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste, waste management has to move from a linear system to being more cyclical so that materials, products and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that it may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling, but, more importantly, it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste designs strive for reduced materials use, use of recycled materials, use of more benign materials, longer product lives, reparability, and ease of disassembly at end of life.[[Zero waste#cite note-Davidson-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment, reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses, communities, industrial sectors, schools and homes.

Benefits proposed by advocates include:
* Saving money. Since waste is a sign of inefficiency, the reduction of waste can reduce costs.
* Faster Progress. A zero waste strategy improves upon production processes and improving environmental prevention strategies which can lead to take larger, more innovative steps.
* Supports sustainability. A zero waste strategy supports all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability - economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* Improved material flows. A zero waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Health ===

A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulfide, which is released during the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mataloni|first=F. |last2=Badaloni|first2=C. |last3=Golini|first3=M. |last4=Bolignano|first4=A. |last5=Bucci|first5=S. |last6=Sozzi|first6=R. |last7=Forastiere|first7=F.|last8=Davoli|first8=M.|last9=Ancona|first9=C.|date=2016|title=Morbidity and mortality of people who live close to municipal waste landfills: a multisite cohort study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=806–15 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyw052 |pmid=27222499 |pmc=5005946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials, and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the ground water and the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masoner|first=Jason R. |last2=Kolpin|first2=Dana W. |last3=Furlong|first3=Edward T. |last4=Cozzarelli|first4=Isabelle M. |last5=Gray|first5=James L. |date=2016-04-01 |title=Landfill leachate as a mirror of today's disposable society: Pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern in final leachate from landfills in the conterminous United States |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |language=en |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=906–918 |doi=10.1002/etc.3219 |issn=1552-8618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over, reducing the need for landfill space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Song|first=Qingbin |last2=Li|first2=Jinhui |last3=Zeng|first3=Xianlai |date=2014 |title=Minimizing the Increasing Solid Waste Through Zero Waste Strategy |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=104 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.027 |pages=199–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process.

Health Issues related to landfills:
* Birth Defects and Low birth weight: Associated with close proximity to landfills, exposure to particle matter and Nitrogen dioxide
* Respiratory disease and Lung Cancer: Related to the release of Hydrogen Sulfide
Zero waste’s promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidences of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste also can help preserve local environments and drinking water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem.

== History ==

=== 2002–2003 ===

The movement gained publicity and reached a peak in 1998–2002, and since then has been moving from "theory into action" by focusing on how a "zero waste community" is structured and behaves. The website of the Zero Waste International Alliance has a listing of communities across the globe that have created public policy to promote zero-waste practices. See also the Eco-Cycle website for examples of how this large nonprofit is leading Boulder County, Colorado on a Zero-Waste path and watch a 6-minute video about the zero-waste big picture. Finally, there is a USA zero-waste organization named the GrassRoots Recycling Network that puts on workshops and conferences about zero-waste activities.

The [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] established a zero waste goal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waste360.com/mag/waste_california_adopts_zero |title=California Adopts Zero Waste Goal in Strategic Plan |author= |date=1 April 2002 |website=waste360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.sfenvironment.org/ City and County of San Francisco’s Department of the Environment] established a goal of zero waste in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfenvironment.org/zero-waste/overview/legislation |title=Policies Related to Zero Waste |author= |date=15 October 2011 |website=SF Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the [[San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance|City's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfenvironment.org/article/recycling-and-composting/mandatory-recycling-and-composting-ordinance|title=Recycling &amp; Composting in San Francisco - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|author=|date=16 May 2013|website=sfenvironment.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its ambitious goal of zero waste and policies, San Francisco reached a record-breaking 80% diversion rate in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=113&amp;page=846|title=Mayor Lee Announces San Francisco Reaches 80 Percent Landfill Waste Diversion, Leads All Cities in North America - Office of the Mayor |author= |date= |website=sfmayor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest diversion rate in any North American city. San Francisco received a perfect score in the waste category in the Siemens US and Canada Green City Index, which named San Francisco the greenest city in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US and Canada Green City Index |date=2011 |url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf |author=Economist Intelligence Unit |publisher=Siemens AG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day ===

The tension between zero waste, viewed as post-discard total [[recycling]] of materials only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example is the difference between smashing a [[glass bottle]] (recovering cheap glass) and [[refill]]ing the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container).
	
The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and [[plastics]] that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context.
	
[[Biodegradable plastic]] is the most prominent example. One side argues that [[biodegradation]] of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest.
	
Companies moving towards "zero landfill" plants include [[Subaru]], [[Xerox]] and [[Anheuser-Busch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2008-02-18-green-factories_N.htm|title="Zero landfill" plants|accessdate= 9 March 2011 | work=USA Today|first=Chris|last=Woodyard|date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement continues to grow among the youth around the world under the organization [https://web.archive.org/web/20130528153545/http://zerowasteyouth.org/en/ Zero Waste Youth], which originated in Brazil and has spread to Argentina, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the United States, and Russia. The organization multiplies with local volunteer ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zerowasteyouth.org/en/?page_id=9 |title=Ambassadors |publisher=Zero Waste Youth Movement |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721182349/http://zerowasteyouth.org/en/?page_id=9 |archivedate=2014-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who lead zero waste gatherings and events to spread the zero waste message.

==Packaging example==
{{main|sustainable packaging}}
{{main|reusable packaging}}
[[File:Glass milk bottles.jpg|right|thumb|Returnable glass milk bottles]]
Milk can be shipped in many forms.  One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common:  one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way [[milk bag]]s, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the [[reuse of bottles]] is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is [[silica]]-[[sand]], which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with [[milk]] and distributed to the consumer. A [[reverse logistics]] system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized.  The  material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Recycling and rotting (composting) ==
{{Main|Recycling}}
	
It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste.
	
Some{{who|date=January 2016}} claim that the key component to zero waste is [[recycling]] while others{{who|date=January 2016}} reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of [[soil]] and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the "recycled" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures.
	 
The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the [[computer industry]] where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as [[electronic waste]] each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of [[raw materials]] while most merely enter dumps through export to [[third world countries]]. Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably [[steel]]&lt;!-- not much steel in a computer--&gt;, [[copper]] and [[glass]], reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the [[refurbishment (electronics)|Computer Refurbishing]] industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair.
	
There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application.
	
The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as [[greenwashing]] i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in [[Alameda County, California]], garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling.

=== Reduce, reuse and recycle ===

Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the [[waste hierarchy|waste hierarchy of refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot (compost)]]. In practice, these laws invariably emphasize destruction and recycling, while the reuse component is marginalized.{{opinion|date=July 2016}}
	
A special feature of Zero Waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as "nuclear waste". All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard, both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling, on the other hand, deals only with simple materials.
	
Zero Waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth's rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources, however defined.

The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement.
	 
Zero waste on the other hand, is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero Waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired, refurbished, re-manufactured and generally reused.. ("What is Zero Waste?", para 2).

Online web services, like [[Freecycle Network|Free Cycle]] or the [http://www.regives.com/ reGives] Network have risen in popularity over the last decade where locals can give items that they no longer need to others locally in an effort to keep items out of landfills and work toward a zero waste lifestyle.

== Significance of dump capacity ==

Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the USA and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil, was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004 and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into "light Texas crude" by the application of high pressure steam.

=== Corporate initiatives ===
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is [[General Motors]] (GM). GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its 181 plants worldwide "landfill-free" by the end of 2010. Companies like [[Subaru]], [[Toyota]], and [[Xerox]] are also producing landfill-free plants. Furthermore, The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by: selling scrap materials, adopting [[reusable part]]s boxes to replace [[cardboard]], and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste.

=== Re-use or rot of waste ===

The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials, such as in the production of [[solar energy]] or [[natural fertilizer]] /[[de-composted]] [[manure]] for crops.

It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use.&lt;ref name="roper"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1504/IJETM.2006.009000| volume = 6 | issue = 3/4| pages = 313–345 | last = Roper | first = William E. | title = Strategies for building material reuse and recycle | journal = International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management | year = 2006 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The success of General Motors in creating zero-landfill facilities shows that zero-waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint," says Latisha Petteway, a spokesperson for the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2008-09-04-gm-zero-landfill_N.htm|title=GM plans to dump use of landfills|last=Cary|first=S. S.|date=4 September 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 is a goal, a process, a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re-designed, resource-efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. [[Deconstruction]] can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials, thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse but it is not a favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components, not their creation from rough materials such as lumber, cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms, entire walls, roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre-built and installed as completed components, that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling, deconstruction is a stop-gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now, the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements, windows, doors, and metals, many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley, California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring, brick walls, and structural timbers.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt; The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts, such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard (with partial recycling of rubble and steel), render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics, based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

Roper's comments in the paragraph above are either misquoted or wrong concerning wood flooring, structural wood and bricks needing to be crushed.  Brick, wood and stone are among the oldest truly recyclable materials used in construction.  A historic review of old buildings, barns and bridges clearly shows that brick, stones and timber are reused from older buildings.  Some of the oldest structures on the planet are built with materials that were recycled from previous structures.  One recent example is the [[Mayflower Barn]] at Jordans just north of High Wycombe, UK.  The barn is clearly built of reused timbers, possibly sourced from the salvage of the Mayflower ship.  It is simply a fact of life that historically materials that could be reused were reused.

In more recent construction, structural timber components, including large timbers, glued laminated beams, floor joists, studs and flooring are some of the most valuable structural components salvaged when a structure is demolished if there is an interest in salvaging.  If you need proof, go down to any local construction salvage yard and look at the value of trusses, wood beams, floor joists, studs and flooring.  Today they have value when someone saves them.

One of the barriers of reusing structural materials is the bias of building code officials and building departments that discriminate against reusing materials.  Codes and building departments require compliance to codes, including the source of materials.  Your average contractor cannot just use 100-year-old 2x8 (50x200) salvaged floor joists because the building department requires a graded joist.  The contractor then has to find an engineer or wood technologist to verify the material suitability for its use.  While the codes technically allow this under alternative method, modern attention to cost usually prevents that option.

==Market-based campaigns==

Market-based, legislation-mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Precautionary Principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they will ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald’s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

==How to achieve==

National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding, but on a practical level, waste management programs (e.g. pickup, dropoff, or containers for recycling and composting) are usually implemented by local governments, possibly with regionally shared facilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Towards a Zero Waste Strategy for an English Local Authority |last = Cole|first = C| journal = Resources, Conservation and Recycling |volume=89 |year=2014 |pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.05.005|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and [[industrial designer]]s to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product lifecycle.  Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain.  If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

===Zero Waste Hierarchy===
The "Zero Waste Hierarchy" describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the Zero Waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials.  It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policy-makers to industry and the individual.  It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to Zero Waste.   It enhances the Zero Waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions.All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the 4th R (recovery)prior to disposal was good, many organizations focused on this 4th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this, along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades, Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle including Compost &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zerowastecanada.ca/zero-waste-hierarchy/ |title=Zero Waste Hierarchy |website=Zero Waste Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An example of [[network governance]] approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management (local authority representatives,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; waste industry, government offices etc.) on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davoudi|first=S|author2=Evans |title=The Challenge of governance in regional waste planning|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|year=2005|volume=23|pages=493–517|doi=10.1068/c42m}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open, so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geels|first=F|title=The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: A report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2008|publisher=DEFRA|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favour of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=C-Y |author2=Ni, S-P |author3=Fan, K-A|title=Working towards a zero waste environment in Taiwan|journal=[[Waste Management &amp; Research]]|year=2010|volume=28|pages=236–244|doi=10.1177/0734242x09337659}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan, public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business, who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frosch|first=R|author2=Gallopoulos |title=Strategies for manufacturing|journal=Scientific American|year=1989|volume=261|pages=144–152|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest development in Zero Waste is the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi which promises to be a Zero Waste city. Innovation and technology is encouraged by government creating an innovation friendly environment without being prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"/&gt; To be a successful model of sustainable urban development it will also require the involvement and co-operation from all members of society emphasizing the importance of network governance.
