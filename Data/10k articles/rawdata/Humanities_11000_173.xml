The '''Asia Commons''' is an attempt to see how ideas of the [[Commons]] are specifically applicable to [[Asia]]n conditions, and may be distinctive from other forms.

It is also the name of a conference, held in early June 2006 in [[Bangkok]], the capital in [[Thailand]].  The event was attended by over a hundred people, mostly from Asia.

==The Concept of an 'Asia Commons'==

There are some theses on why the [[Commons]] idea in Asia would be different from those elsewhere. For example: 
* common village land is still in existence in Asia, not in the West;
* the problems of access are more serious in most Asian countries;
* unauthorized copying/sharing of software, music and audio CDs or DVDs is more common than in the West.
 
More specifically, the term Asia Commons is the movement to create and sustain the Commons in Asia.

== The Commons, as a concept ==

There are many type of commons, but the focus could be divided basically into two—natural resources, and man-made resources.

The commons is: 
* any common resource that is available to all (but can be defined locally, or specifically as 'everybody in category x')
* a series of specific institutional formats used to manage such
* the movement that promotes them.

The open/free, [[participatory]]/p2p, and commons are a related the three-legged stool of paradigms: 
* ''Free and open'' - ensures access to the raw material to build the common
* ''Participatory'' - refers to the process of broad participation in order to actually build it
* The commons is the ''institutional format'' - used to prevent private appropriation of said creations
* ''Cyclical'' - The circle is closed when commons-generated material is again free/open raw material for the next cycle of the circulation of the commons.

==The Asia Commons Conference: June 6–8, 2006==

Asia Commons, or the Asian Conference on the Digital Commons, was a conference held between June 6 to 8, 2006 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its website says that during the past two decades, the "''level, scope, territorial extent, and role of copyrights and patents have expanded into new sectors, often without development considerations''".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191031/http://www.asia-commons.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference discussed issues pertaining to the Asian Digital Commons, [[free software|Free/Libre and Open Source Software]], business models and collaborative models, Intellectual Property Rights, patents, copyrights, copylefts, the grey economy and its impact on the Asian "developing world", ideas of the Creative Commons, alternate law practices, [[A2K|access to knowledge (a2k)]], Open Access, open alternatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) practices and open standards.

===Goal, purpose===

The Asia Commons event was aimed at creating "many opportunities where deep discussions and exchange can happen". The conference organisers said they "recognise that all participants have experience and ideas that are relevant and as a result, expect them to contribute to the discussions on issues and topics of interest."

Organisers said (in a conference kit presented to participants) that through an exchange of experience and knowledge, the Asia Commons conference aimed at bringing participants together to:

* Increase understanding of the effects of copyrights and patents, specially software patents, on access to knowledge and culture in Asia.
* Conceptualise locally-relevant models for collaborative creation and dissemination of knowledge and culture.
* Enhance partnerships to build collaboration through collaborative projects.
* Identify information gaps and further areas of research.
* Contribute towards the production of material for wider dissemination and decision-making.

===Participation===

Some 137 participants were listed to take part in the event. They came in from a range of countries from Asia ([[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], China, [[Hong Kong]] (PRC), India, [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]],  [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]]) and beyond (Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Fiji]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ghana]], Israel, [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[South Africa]], [[Uganda]], UK, the United States, [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]).

===Speakers===

Some of the speakers included [[Peter Drahos]] of the [[Australian National University]] and [[James Love (NGO director)|Jamie Love]] of the [[Consumer Project on Technology]], both of whom were joint keynote speakers. [[Bangalore]] based lawyer of the [http://www.altlawforum.org Alternate Law Forum] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150554/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Lawrence_Liang Lawrence Liang], independent writer and researcher [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822205601/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Vijayalakshmi_Balakrishnan Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan] of New Delhi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822090910/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Dr._N.S._Gopalakrishanan Dr N.S.

The participatory spectogram session on "Patents and Innovation" included as keynote speakers, FOSS advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150841/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Fouad_Riaz_Bajwa Fouad Riaz Bajwa] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060804082653/http://fossfp.org/ Free and Open Source Foundation of Pakistan (FOSSFP)] and advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614153420/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Rahul_Matthan Rahul Matthan] of [[Trilegal]], India with the session led by [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110718234259/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-63152-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Laurent Elder] of [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]].

There were sessions on "History of the Commons, Evolution of Copyright and the Emergence of the Digital Economy: Exploring the Relationships", "Copyright and the Information Grey Economy: A Regional Comparison", "Patents and Innovation", and "Open Business Models".

Using the "speed sharing" model, there was also a session on collaborative projects. Each speaker, talked to small groups of participants, and had just three minutes in which to explain their work and concepts. This was followed by a session of 'round tables' on the issue of collaborative models: factors that lead to successful collaborations, opportunities and challenges.

Towards the end, the focus shifted to building an overview of the Asia Commons—ideas and issues, issues and opportunities, what could be done to move forward, and what is being moved forward.

===Organisers===

This event was organised at the Chaophya Park Hotel and organised by [[Bellanet|Bellanet International Secretariat]], the Delhi-based [[Centre for Science, Development and Media Studies (CSDMS)]], [[South Asia Partnership International]], and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] [[Asia Pacific Development Information Programme]]'s [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN).

This event was financially supported by the [[International Development Research Centre|International Development Research Centre (IDRC)]] of Canada and UNDP APDIP's [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN). Local partners in organising the event were the [[Asian Institute of Technology]] based in Bangkok and the [[Thai Rural Net]] (TRN).

It was a [[Global Knowledge Partnership]] (GKP) members' event.

===Open Space===

This event used the 'open space' approach to focus on issues of relevance.

As defined [[Open Space Technology|elsewhere]] in the Wikipedia: "Open Space Technology enables groups of any size to address complex, important issues and achieve meaningful results quickly. It is at its best where more traditional meeting formats fail: when there is conflict, complexity, diversity of thought or people and short decision times. It has been used in widely diverse settings, from designing airplane doors at a large airplane manufacturing company to engaging street kids in defining a sustainable jobs program. Originated by Harrison Owen in 1986, Open Space has been used in over 100 countries and in diverse settings, industries, cultures and situations - for program and product design, knowledge exchange, interdisciplinary thinking, conflict resolution and conferences."

Organisers of the event were quoted as saying that [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020234236/http://www.asia-commons.net/asiaopenspace they had doubts] whether the Open Space approach would be suitable in Asia. But it was.

===Emergent issues ===

One of the issues to emerge from the meeting was a regional (Asia-wide) focus on  Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS, or FOSS). Diosdado "Dong" Calmada of the Philippines held a session with this concern. He was keen to look at why Asia had so many GNU/Linux user groups, but seldom seemed to  care about the big picture. This region, he suggested, was too concerned about its own technical problems. "There's a need to broaden the perspective of our groups. After all, LUGs (Linux-user groups) are potent forces," he was quoted as saying. It was felt that Asia, with all its tech skills and software talent, is all but invisible in the world of Free Software and Open Source. People do not link up with one another, within countries or across borders. There's little communication happening within the otherwise successful FOSS movement across this vast continent.

[[Michel Bauwens]] of the [http://www.p2pfoundation.net P2PFoundation], which has a wide variety of links to P2P or peer-to-peer networking examples, explained his perspective saying, "The basic idea I had was that there's a new social movement emerging, which is really about extending the realm of participation to the whole of life. We live in a representative democracy, which says you can vote every four years, and choose which people who exercise power on your behalf... now we're building tools and resources which say everybody needs to be involved, and everybody should have a voice (in other areas too, apart from just voting)."

[[Paola di Maio]], another participant, narrated her experiences in deploying technology to cope with the fury of nature, as reflected in the December 26, 2004 [[Asian tsunami]]. She commented: "Our emergency collaboration model emerged after we became familiar with the tsunami. I was in Thailand then. My internet was working but all the phone were down. So I got online via my tiny mobile, and was looking for information. We knew something big had happened, but there was simply no news emerging. One or two hours after the wave hit, there were headlines reporting an 'earthquake'."

Sacha of [[Indymedia]] in the US shared his group's experience with building alternatives from the grassroots. Currently, the [[Indymedia]] global network of participatory journalism has local units in 160 cities in 80 countries, and every continent. He said: "Indymedia was created in 1999 to cover the WTO ([[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]]) Ministerial and protests against it in Seattle. There were some 5000 activists taking part. Many strands from the [[Global Justice Movement]] joined in."

[[Lawrence Liang]], a lawyer trained at the prestigious [[National Law School of India]], had a session along with others on "countering IP propaganda". [[Ronaldo Lemos]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] school of law referred to [[Yochai Benkler]]'s book, ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]''. He also pointed to [[Jimmy Wales]], who has said that in the foreseeable future there would be 12 fields that would become free. These things are: the encyclopedia, the dictionary, academic curriculum, music, art in general, file formats, maps, product identifiers, search engines, production made by communities, TV listings, academic publishing. [[Ronaldo Lemos]] felt that things lacking in this list included news and software.

Said Delhi-based independent writer and researcher Vijayalakshmi "Viju" Balakrishnan: "In Asia, the history of (colonial) trade has largely been sea-based trade. And the language and philosophy now governing the way cyberspace is being controlled has strong parallels to what we saw in the seventeenth century. Free trade has functioned through pirate-based models. There were cartels or guild-power. For us in India it was the East India Company. For our friends in South East Asia, it was the VOC or the Dutch East India Company. Today, it is the Wintel (Windows-Intel) combo. In comparison to the state-control model of the past, we now have the story of how Google enters China."

A number of other issues also emerged from the conference, which are aptly captured in the conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091257/http://access5.bellanet.org/asia-commons.net/arc/participants discussion list], [http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons wiki]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and multiple blogs.

===Advisors to the Event===

Members of the Asia Commons advisory group are [http://www.dgroups.org/groups/asiacommons-advisory networked through this list]. Those thanked for giving their "valuable advice" in shaping the Asia Commons conference includes (in a list which "is not complete... and will continue to grow") include [[Lawrence Liang]] of the [[Alternative Law Forum]], [[iCommons]] director [[Paula Le Dieu]], [[Creative Commons South Africa]] director [[Heather Ford]], [[Open Society Foundation]] information programme manager [[Vera Franz]], [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] [[Pan Asia Networking]] team leader [[Laurent Elder]], [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] [[Asia-Pacific|Pan Asia]]'s [[Frank Tulus]], [[International Open Source Network]] manager [[Sunil Abraham]], and [[Association of Asian Confederation of Credit Union]]'s [[Ranjith Hettiarachchi]].

'''Atil''' ({{lang-tr|İtil}}; cf. {{zh|c=阿得/阿得水}} ''A-de Shui''), literally meaning "Big River", was the capital of [[Khazaria]] from the middle of the 8th century until the end of the 10th century. The word is also a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] name for the [[Volga River]].

==History==
[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|right|535px|Map showing the major Varangian trade routes: the [[Volga trade route]] (in red) and the [[Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] (in purple). Other trade routes of the 8th–11th centuries shown in orange (note that Atil is the major commercial outpost from which trade extends into the far reaches of "Deep Asia").]]

Atil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Following the defeat of the [[Khazars]] in the [[Second Arab-Khazar War]], Atil became the capital of Khazaria. The city is referred to as [[Khamlij]] in 9th-century Arab sources, and the name Atil appears in the 10th century. At its height, the city was a major center of trade, and consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison. The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of the Atil, and had many public baths and shops. Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar [[Khagan]] and [[Khagan Bek|Bek]]. The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge. According to Arab sources, one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named [[Khazaran]].

Atil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by [[Jew]]s, [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Shamanism|Shamanists]], and [[Paganism|Pagans]], many of them traders from foreign countries. All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans).

[[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE. [[Ibn Hawqal]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]] refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. [[Al-Biruni]] (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins, and did not mention the later city of [[Saqsin]] which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.

==Alleged site==

The archaeological remains of Atil have never been positively identified. It has been hypothesized that they were washed away by the rising level of the [[Caspian Sea]]. However, beginning in 2003 Dmitri Vasilyev of [[Astrakhan State University]] led a series of excavations at the Samosdelskoye site near the village of [[Samosdelka]] (Russian: Самосделка) in the Volga Delta. Vasilyev connected artifacts from the site with Khazar, Oghuz and Bulgar culture, leading him to believe that he had discovered the site of Saqsin. The matter is still unresolved. In 2006 Vasilyev announced his belief that the lowest stratum at the Samosdelka site was identical with the site of Atil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Vasilyev | first =  D.| title = Итиль-мечта (The Itil Dream) | url = http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/174/VZR/a02.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this team of Russian archaeologists announced that they had discovered the ruins of Atil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirovalev |first=Mansur |title=Scholar claims to find medieval Jewish capital |work=Yahoo News |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-09-20 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080920/ap_on_re_eu/russia_lost_capital |accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927200637/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080920/ap_on_re_eu/russia_lost_capital |archivedate=27 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Bertrams was bought by [[Woolworths Group]] in 2007. The acquisition was reviewed by the [[Competition Commission (United Kingdom)|Competition Commission]].

The retail business of Woolworths Group and its distribution firm [[Entertainment UK]] entered [[Administration (law)|administration]] in November 2008, although Bertrams did not as it operated as a separate division within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bertrams escapes as Woolies fails |author=Graeme Neill |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/bertrams-escapes-woolies-falls.html |newspaper=The Bookseller |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woolworths Group entered into administration itself in January 2009.

Bertrams entered administration on 20 March 2009 and sold on the same day by [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in a "pre-pack" deal to [[Smiths News]] (now Connect Group) for £8,611,622.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bertrams sold to Smiths News |author=Graeme Neill |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/bertrams-sold-smiths-news.html |newspaper=The Bookseller |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brandenburger Tor Potsdam Stadtseite 2015.jpg|thumb|Brandenburg Gate from the city side by Carl von Gontard]]

The '''Brandenburg Gate''' ({{lang-de|Brandenburger Tor}}) on the ''[[Luisenplatz (Potsdam)|Luisenplatz]]'' in '''[[Potsdam]]''', not to be confused with the [[Brandenburg Gate|gate of the same name]] on [[Berlin]]'s ''Pariser Platz'', was built in 1770/71 by [[Carl von Gontard]] and [[Georg Christian Unger]] by order of [[Frederick II of Prussia]]. It stands at the western end of ''Brandenburger Straße'', which runs in a straight line up to the Church of [[St. Peter and St. Paul, Potsdam|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter and St. Paul]].

Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll or excise barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling.

Towards the end of the [[Seven Years' War]], Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory. For that reason the Brandenburg Gate resembles a Roman [[triumphal arch]]. Its prototype was the [[Arch of Constantine]] in [[Rome]]. The Roman influence of its architectural style can be seen, for example, in the double columns of [[Corinthian order]] as well as the design of the [[attic (architecture)|attic]].

A feature of the Brandenburg Gate is that it has two completely different sides, designed by two architects. [[Carl von Gontard]] designed the city side, his pupil, Georg Christian Unger, the field or countryside-facing side. Gontard made the city side as a rendered facade with Corinthian-style [[lesene]]s and trophies, Unger designed the field site in the style of the Arch of Constantine with Corinthian double-columns and ornamentation like the golden trumpets. The two side entrances for pedestrians were not added until 1843, under [[Frederick William&amp;nbsp;IV]], in order to cope with the increase in pedestrian traffic.

At that time people had to pass the Brandenburg Gate if they wanted to make their way to the [[Brandenburg an der Havel|town of Brandenburg]], hence the name. The gate leads walkers into the city centre pedestrian zone of ''Brandenburger Straße'' in an easterly direction up to priory church of St. Peter and St. Paul.

Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.

The '''''Canada Gazette''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Gazette du Canada'''}}) is the official newspaper of the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Collections&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Carole|title=A Glance at the Canada Gazette: Past, Present and Future|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gazette-du-canada/035001-2000-e.html|work=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on October 2, 1841.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deavy|first=Betty|author2=Gauld, Norma|title=The Canada Gazette|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|date=1994|volume=17|issue=2|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=149&amp;art=1005|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally it published all acts of the [[Parliament of Canada]], it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt;  At one time it contained information on bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt; It has been administered by [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]] and the [[Queen's Printer]] since 1841. The ''Gazette'' is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

==Legal status==
While not always widely read by the public, publication in the ''Gazette'' is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] and then the [[Cabinet of Canada]], the regulation is published in the ''Gazette''.&lt;ref name="Can Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernhardt|first=Peter|title=Understanding the Regulation Making Process|url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=245&amp;param=82|work=Canadian Parliamentary Review|accessdate=7 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a regulation has not been published in the ''Gazette'', a person cannot be convicted of the offence.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Statutory Instruments Act|year=1985|section=11|subsection=2|abbr=RSO|chapter=S-22|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] all have their own equivalents of the ''Gazette''.

==Publishing==
From inception in 1841 until 1998, the ''Gazette'' was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt; From 1 April 2014 onwards, it will only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make "electronic publishing its new standard for all documents".&lt;ref name="online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|title=Discontinuance of the Printed Copy of the Canada Gazette — Reminder|publisher=Canada Gazette Directorate|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303200747/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2013/0705-eng.asp|title=Government of Canada moves to e-printing|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structurally, the ''Gazette'' is published in three parts:

===Part I===
Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation.&lt;ref name="Can Review" /&gt; Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

===Part II===
Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.

===Part III===
Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received [[Royal Assent]] and was first published in 1974.  Starting from January 1998 all  publications other than Part III are available in [[HTML]] and are not official.  From  April 1, 2003, the [[PDF]] version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders in council relating to the coming into force of federal acts.

==Exemptions==
Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the ''Gazette''. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defense or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

==Neolithic settlement==
The [[Neolithic]] settlement at Carn Brea was a [[tor enclosure]] occupied between around 3700 and 3400 BC. [[Roger Mercer]] directed archaeological excavations of the site in 1970.&lt;ref name=RJM1970&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-acre (0.8 ha) inner enclosure was surrounded by one of eleven acres (4.5 ha). The ramparts consisted of stone walls with an earth bank and ditch. Traces of fourteen platforms on which would have stood [[Neolithic long house]]s have been found within its ramparts, along with pottery and flint [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]].

The settlement had an estimated population of 100 to 150. There is evidence that the occupants cleared the surrounding land for farming by burning away the undergrowth and removing stones although the acid soil obliterated any environmental evidence. Nearby outcrops of rock suitable for making [[axe]]s would have contributed to the village's economy. Edge grinding stones, [[blank (archeology)|blanks]] and incomplete and finished axes found on the site indicate the inhabitants were accomplished stoneworkers and traded their products. Pottery found on the site appears to have been made from [[gabbro]]ic clay originating nearly 20 miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) to the south in the present day parish of [[St Keverne]] suggesting a complex economic network in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=St. Keverne Local History Society |title=The Prehistoric use of Gabbroic Clay from St Keverne |url=http://www.st-keverne.com/History/arch/gabbroic-clay.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203172106/http://www.st-keverne.com/History/arch/gabbroic-clay.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 700 flint arrowheads were found scattered at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall Archaeological Society. Carn Brea, Early Neolithic tor enclosure, c 3700 BC http://www.royalarchinst.org/jubilee/cas&lt;/ref&gt; Despite nineteenth-century destruction (work to level and widen the entrance track), there was a concentration of arrow heads around a probable entrance to the enclosure, Mercer's site E. These arrows may have been used by a large group of archers in an organized assault upon a defended site.&lt;ref&gt;Shadowland, Wales 300-1500 BC. Steve Burrow, National Museum of Wales  / Oxbow Books, 2011, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; Every timber structure on the site had been burnt, and charcoal was the only organic matter that survived the acid soils. The earthworks may have been deliberately damaged by invaders.

==Iron Age settlement==
In the [[Iron Age]] the site was reoccupied and minerals were mined from the hillside. One hut floor was excavated, and sherds of characteristically Iron Age types, including 'cordoned ware', were found.&lt;ref name=RJM1972/&gt;  The fortified gateway, Mercer's Site G, was of Iron Age form, and Mercer suggests that although Site G produced no Iron Age artifacts, it is post-Neolithic. The crushed-rock road surface showed little sign of contemporary wear and could never have been subjected to even a modicum of traffic.&lt;ref name=RJM1972/&gt;

A [[hoard]] of Gallo-Belgic gold [[stater]]s originating from northeastern Gaul and [[Kent]] were found in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;As referenced in Mercer, 1970: 
BORLASE, WILLIAM, Observations on Antiquities . . . of the County of Cornwall (Oxford, 1754).
ALLEN, D. F., "The origins of coinage in Britain—a reappraisal', in: Frere, S. S., ed.. Problems of the Iron Age in Southern Britain (1960), 97 ff.
ALLAN, J., 'The Carn Brea hoard of 1749', Numism. Chron., 6th ser. 8 (1948), 235-6—this 'does not analyse the hoard correctly' (so ALLEN, D. F., art. cit., 287).
and for the first 20th-century republication of the hoard, Allen, D. (1944). I.—The Belgic Dynasties of Britain and their Coins. Archaeologia, 90, 1-46. doi:10.1017/S0261340900009747&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ravenna Cosmography]], of around AD 700, refers to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), 'a fort or walled settlement of the [[Cornovii (Cornish)|Cornovii]]' (unidentified, but possibly [[Tintagel]] or Carn Brea).

; Basset Monument
At the highest point of the hill is a 90-feet high (27m) [[Celtic cross]] erected as a monument to [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset]] (1757–1835). Basset, a mine owner, gained his titles for erecting earthworks to defend [[Plymouth]] from combined French and Spanish fleets in 1779, and suppressing a miners' "food riot" in 1785.&lt;ref name=CornishWorld&gt;[http://www.cornishworld.net/HISTORYMAKERS/Basset_family.htm "The Bassets of Tehidy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170928/http://www.cornishworld.net/HISTORYMAKERS/Basset_family.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}, Cornish History Reference Files, CornishWorld.net.

In a depression between the monument and the castle are the remains of the "Smugglers' Cave". It was blocked with rocks by the council in the 1980s to stop children entering. The tunnel is rumoured to extend from the top of the carn  into Redruth town, but it is probably an abandoned mine working. It may have been confused with another tunnel from the castle to St Uny's church which was blocked for safety reasons around 1970 by the castle owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tangye|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Historic Environment Service|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{coord|50|13|19|N|5|14|50|W|region:GB_type:landmark|name=Smugglers' Cave}}

; Saint Euny's Well
Saint Euny's Well is at the foot of Carn Brea below the castle near [[Euny|St Euny]]'s Church. It has a plaque by Carn Brea Parish Trails reading ''"St Euny Well. Holy well of St Euny visited by the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Missionary]] 500AD"''. Stories about its sacred use may be confused with St Euny's Well at Sancreed (see [[Carn Euny]]).

==Events==
At Easter Redruth Baptist Church erects a lit cross on the outcrop behind the Castle overlooking Redruth. For many years a Christian sunrise service has been held on Easter Sunday.

The [[Midsummer Eve]] ([[St. John's Eve]], 23 June) bonfire ceremony originated as a [[pagan]] ritual. Prayers are read in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and the bonfire is lit, signalling other fires to be lit at [[Sennen]], [[Sancreed Beacon]], [[Carn Galver]] to the [[River Tamar|Tamar]]. When only the embers remain, young people leap across them to drive away evil and bring luck.&lt;ref name=CN&gt;{{Cite book |last=Noall |first=Cyril |year=1963 |title=The Cornish Midsummer Eve bonfire celebrations |publisher=Federation of Old Cornwall Societies |series=Federation of Old Cornwall Societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34709">The '''conservation and restoration of copper and copper-alloy objects''' is the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[copper]] or [[copper alloy]]. When applied to items of [[cultural heritage]], this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from copper or copper alloy were created for religious, artistic, technical, military, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with copper or copper-alloy objects.

Previously the only tool made of copper had been the awl, used for punching holes in leather and gouging out peg-holes for wood joining. However, the introduction of a more robust form of copper led to the widespread use, and large-scale production of heavy metal tools, including axes, [[adze]]s, and axe-adzes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Bronze Age===
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after "natural bronze" had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from [[Sumer]]ian cities and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite book|pages = 13, 48–66|title = Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology|author = McNeil, Ian |publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|location = London ; New York|isbn = 0-203-19211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Age]] began in Southeastern Europe around 3700 - 3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000-1000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the [[Neolithic]] period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the [[Chalcolithic]] period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Calcholithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|left|100px|In [[alchemy]] the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the goddess and planet [[Venus]].]]
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], Israel.]]

In Greece, copper was known by the name ''chalkos'' (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as ''aes Cyprium'', ''aes'' being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and ''Cyprium'' from [[Cyprus]], where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to ''cuprum'', hence the English ''copper''. [[Aphrodite]] and [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Nomenclature of Copper and its Alloys|author = Rickard, T. A. |journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume = 62|year = 1932|page=281|jstor = 2843960|doi = 10.2307/2843960|publisher =  Royal Anthropological Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's first use of brass occurred around the 3rd–2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on [[Isle Royale]] with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The State of Our Knowledge About Ancient Copper Mining in Michigan|journal = The Michigan Archaeologist|volume = 41|page = 119|author = Martin, Susan R. |year = 1995|url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html|issue =2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD; it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.

The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. [[Julius Caesar]] had his own coins made from brass, while [[Augustus|Octavianus Augustus Caesar]]'s coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, [[Roman metallurgy|Roman copper mining and smelting activities]] reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; the [[Roman province|provinces]] most intensely mined were those of [[Hispania]], [[Cyprus]] and in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.272.5259.246|title = History of Ancient Copper Smelting Pollution During Roman and Medieval Times Recorded in Greenland Ice|pages = 246–249 (247f.)|year = 1996|last1 = Hong|first1 = S.|last2 = Candelone|first2 = J.-P.|issue = 5259|last3 = Patterson|first3 = C.

The gates of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] used [[Corinthian bronze]] made by depletion gilding. It was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.goldbulletin.org/downloads/JACOB_2_33.PDF |title=Corinthian Bronze and the Gold of the Alchemists |author6=Sudhölter, Ernst J.

Ancient Egyptians (~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later on for headaches, burns, and itching. The [[Baghdad Battery]], with copper cylinders soldered to lead, dates back to 248 BC to AD 226 and resembles a galvanic cell, leading people to believe this was the first battery; the claim has not been verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mysteries – Strange Artifacts, Baghdad Battery|url=http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_11.htm|work=World-Mysteries.com|accessdate=22 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505154602/http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_11.htm|archivedate=5 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|right|thumb|[[Acid mine drainage]] affecting the stream running from the disused [[Parys Mountain]] copper mines]]
The [[Great Copper Mountain]] was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It produced two thirds of Europe's copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4yp-x3TzDnEC&amp;pg=PA60|page = 60|title = Mining in World History|isbn = 978-1-86189-173-0|author1 = Lynch, Martin|date = 2004-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a [[History of copper currency in Sweden|copper backed currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold: prices, facts, figures and research: A brief history of money|url=http://www.galmarley.com/FAQs_pages/monetary_history_faqs.htm#Scandinavian%20copper%20money|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uses of copper in art were not limited to currency: it was used by [[Renaissance]] sculptors, in photographic technology known as the [[daguerreotype]], and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. [[Copper plating]] and [[copper sheathing]] for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Copper History|url = http://www.copperinfo.com/aboutcopper/history.html|accessdate = 2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norddeutsche Affinerie]] in Hamburg was the first modern [[electroplating]] plant starting its production in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/adem.200400403|title = Process Optimization in Copper Electrorefining|year = 2004|author = Stelter, M.|journal = Advanced Engineering Materials|volume = 6|issue = 7|page=558|last2 = Bombach|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German scientist [[Gottfried Osann]] invented [[powder metallurgy]] in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. [[Flash smelting]] was developed by [[Outokumpu]] in Finland and first applied at [[Harjavalta]] in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world’s primary copper production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outokumpu.com/files/Technology/Documents/Newlogobrochures/FlashSmelting.pdf |title=Outokumpu Flash Smelting |publisher=[[Outokumpu]] |page=2 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724043222/http://www.outokumpu.com/files/Technology/Documents/Newlogobrochures/FlashSmelting.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries]], formed in 1967 with Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, played a similar role for copper as [[OPEC]] does for oil. It never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karen A.

==Conservation==

===Historical objects===

====Documentation====
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of   materials and procedures used to produce  object and the results of any scientific research  must be  part of  documentation too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

====Research====
*identification of metals,alloys and metallic coatings
*identification of other organic/inorganic materials
*identification of corrosion products and processes
*identification of technology used to produce object

====Decision making====
In preparing the strategy  of the metals conservation project   interdisciplinary approach to the same is  essential.It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take  curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion  of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the  conservator - restorer

==Preventive conservation==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40%(35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes)with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood based products(Particle board, plywood) must be avoided. Also do not use rubber, felt or wool .When you are handling metal objects,always wear clean cotton gloves . Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects,up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials).

Beethoven's and Bruckner's copyists --&gt;
[[File:Art-students and copyists in the Louvre gallery, Paris.jpg|thumb|270px|Art-students and copyists in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre gallery]], [[Paris]], 1868.]]A '''copyist''' is a person who makes copies. 
The term is sometimes used for artists who make copies of other artists' paintings.  However, the modern use of the term is almost entirely confined to music copyists, who are employed by the [[music industry]] to produce neat copies from a [[composer]] or arranger's manuscript.

==Music copyists==
Until the 1990s, most copyists worked by hand to write out scores and individual instrumental parts neatly, using a [[calligraphy]] pen, [[manuscript paper]], and often a ruler. Producing parts for an entire [[orchestra]] from a full score was a huge task. In the 1990s, copyists began using [[scorewriter]]s - computer programs which are the music notation equivalent of a [[word processor]]. (Such programs include ''[[Sibelius (computer program)|Sibelius]]'', ''[[Finale (computer program)|Finale]]'', ''[[MuseScore]]'' or ''[[GNU LilyPond]]''). Scorewriters allow the composer or songwriter to "enter" the melodies, rhythms and lyrics to their compositions into the computer using a mouse or by playing the notes on a [[MIDI]]-equipped keyboard. Once a composition is fully entered into a scorewriting program, the computer can be instructed to print out the parts for all of the different instruments.

Both handwritten and computer-based copying require significant understanding of [[musical notation]], [[music theory]], the musical styles and conventions of different styles of music (e.g., regarding appropriate ornamentation, [[harmony]] rules pertaining to [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s, etc.), and strong attention to detail and past conventions. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] had a contentious relationship with his copyists, who often made mistakes that remained uncorrected until the advent of [[Urtext edition]]s; some [[musicologist]]s have devoted a lot of effort to identifying Beethoven's copyists.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Alan (1970). Autumn. "Notes on Five of Beethoven's Copyists" '''23''' 3 ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syriantravel.jpg|thumb|Plate from ''The Crescent and the Cross'' by [[Elliot Warburton]] entitled "Encampment at [[Baalbek|Baalbec]], lady and dragoman in foreground."]]
A '''dragoman''' was an [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreter]], translator, and official guide between [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking countries and [[polity|polities]] of the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]]an [[Embassy|embassies]], [[consulate]]s, vice-consulates and [[trading post]]s. A dragoman had to have a knowledge of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and European languages.

The position took particular prominence in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where demand for the mediation provided by dragomans is said to have been created by the resistance on the part of the [[Islam|Muslim]] Ottomans to learn the languages of non-Muslim nations. The office incorporated [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] as well as linguistic duties—namely, in the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]'s relation with [[Christendom|Christian countries]]—and some dragomans thus came to play crucial roles in Ottoman politics. The profession tended to be dominated by ethnic [[Greeks]], including the first Ottoman [[Dragoman of the Sublime Porte]], [[Panagiotis Nikousios]], the official interpreter for the ''Divan'' ([[Imperial Council (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Council]]) of the Sultan, and his successor [[Alexander Mavrocordatos]]. But this dominance changed in 1821 with the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1821 the chief dragoman Constantine Mourouzi was executed for suspected disloyalty, and his successor, Stavraki Aristarchi, was dismissed and exiled in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Bosworth, C.E. |title=Tard̲j̲umān| year= 2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_1179|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With unanswered correspondence accumulating, the chief naval instructor, one [[Ishak Efendi]], took over the position and became a pioneer in translation of Western scientific literature into Turkish, a task for which he had to create an entirely new vocabulary. Following Ishak, the grand dragoman and his staff were Muslims, and the Translation Office (''Tercüme Odası'', "Translation Room", in Turkish), with its familiarity with things European, became a new major ladder to influence and power in the [[Tanzimat]] era; this knowledge largely replaced the older ladders of the army, the bureaucracy, and the religious establishment in the mid- and late-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|year=2002|title=What Went Wrong|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-06-051605-5|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became customary that most [[hospodar]]s of the [[Phanariote]] rule (roughly 1711–1821) over the [[Danubian Principalities]] ([[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]) would previously have occupied this Ottoman office, a fact which did not prevent many of them from joining conspiracies that aimed to overthrow Turkish rule over the area.

==Etymology and variants==
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the word is ترجمان (''tarjumān''), in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''tercüman''. Deriving from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[quadriliteral]] root ''t-r-g-m'', it appears in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as "targumannu," in [[Ge'ez]] (Classical Ethiopic) as ''t-r-gw-m'', and in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as ''targemana''. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] makes a distinction between מתרגם (''metargem'')—referring to a translator of written texts—and מתורגמן (''meturgeman'') referring to an interpreter of spoken conversation or speeches. The latter is obviously more closely related to the other languages mentioned, though both are derived from the same Semitic root. There has been speculation of a Hittite origin of the term (Salonen, p.&amp;nbsp;12; Rabin, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–136).

During the Middle Ages the word entered European languages: in [[Middle English]] as ''dragman'', from [[Old French]] ''drugeman'', from [[Medieval Latin]] as ''dragumannus'', from [[Medieval Greek|Middle Greek]] δραγομάνος, ''dragoumanos''. Later European variants include the [[German language|German]] ''trutzelmann'', the [[French language|French]] ''trucheman'' or ''truchement'' (in modern French it is ''drogman''), the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''turcimanno'', and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''trujamán'', ''trujimán'' and ''truchimán''; these variants point to a Turkish or Arabic word "turjuman", with different vocalization. ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' of 1828 lists ''dragoman'' as well as the variants ''drogman'' and ''truchman'' in English.

Consequently, the plural, in English, is "dragomans" (not "dragomen").

The family name of [[Franjo Tudjman]], the first post-Communist President of [[Croatia]], indicates that one of his ancestors might have been a dragoman.

==History==
In the Turkish tradition, the dragoman position is recorded in the pre-Ottoman [[Sultanate of Rum]] during the 13th-century reign of [[Keykubad I]] when two dragomans and two translator clerks were appointed.&lt;ref name="Baker2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mona Baker|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXsDckV5GuMC&amp;pg=PA550|accessdate=22 September 2012|date=9 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36930-5|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ottoman records, the first imperial dragoman recorded was Lutfi Bey or [[Lutfi Pasha]] who was sent to [[Venice]] in 1479 to deliver a treaty.&lt;ref name="Baker2008"/&gt;

These men were instrumental in spreading a wide-ranging curiosity about Islamic culture throughout the Latin parts of Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The dragomans had scholarly language training in Persian, Arabic and Turkish since they were translators, interpreters, authors and were very open to the material and fashionable intricacies of the Ottoman culture.

The first French translation of the [[Quran]] was done by [[André du Ryer]], in 1647. He was from the French consulate in Egypt. Another, Cosmo of Carbognano, from the [[Naples]] embassy, published in Latin: ''The Principles of Turkish Grammar for The Use of Apostolic Missionaries in Constantinople'' (Rome 1794). {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

As a highly trained group of diplomatic professionals, they were employed by embassies, consuls and travelled in diplomatic circles, hence their need to know the culture very well. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There was huge success from the published translation of ''Thousand And One Nights'', by [[Antoine Galland]] (1646-1715). He was attached to the embassy of [[Charles Marie François Olier, marquis de Nointel]], a [[Paris]]ian who was a councilor to the [[Parlement de Paris]], and a French ambassador to the [[Ottoman court]], 1670 to 1679.

One who created a large European interest in the history of Islam, with his published ''History of the Ottoman Empire'' was [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] of Austria, a student at the [[Diplomatic Academy of Vienna]] (the academy was initially established by [[Empress Maria Theresa]] in 1754 as "The Oriental Academy" to train young diplomats to represent the [[Habsburg Empire]] abroad).&lt;ref name="Europe and the Islamic World: A History "&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title="Europe and the Islamic World: A History".|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=245–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mug shots of the 33 convicted members of the Duquesne spy ring (cropped).tif|right|thumb|275px|The 33 convicted members of the Duquesne spy ring (FBI print).]]

The '''Duquesne Spy Ring''' is the largest [[espionage]] case in [[United States history]] that ended in convictions. A total of 33 members of a [[Nazi Germany|German]] espionage network headed by [[Fritz Joubert Duquesne|Frederick "Fritz" Joubert Duquesne]] were convicted after a lengthy investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Of those indicted, 19 pleaded guilty. The remaining 14 were brought to jury trial in [[Federal District Court]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], on September 3, 1941; all were found guilty on December 13, 1941. On January 2, 1942, the group was sentenced to serve a total of over 300 years in prison.

The agents who formed the Duquesne Ring were placed in key jobs in the United States to get information that could be used in the event of war and to carry out acts of [[sabotage]]: one opened a restaurant and used his position to get information from his customers; another worked on an airline so that he could report [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships that were crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; others worked as delivery people as a cover for carrying secret messages.

[[William G. Sebold]], who had been blackmailed into becoming a spy for Germany, became a [[double agent]] and helped the FBI gather evidence. For nearly two years, the FBI ran a [[shortwave radio]] station in New York for the ring. They learned what information Germany was sending its spies in the United States and controlled what was sent to Germany. Sebold's success as a [[counterespionage]] agent was demonstrated by the successful prosecution of the German agents.

One German spymaster later commented the ring's roundup delivered "the death blow" to their espionage efforts in the United States. FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] called his concerted FBI swoop on Duquesne's ring the greatest spy roundup in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="timeobit"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 4, 1956|title=Obituary.

==Convicted members of Duquesne Spy Ring==
===Frederick Joubert Duquesne aka Fritz Joubert Duquesne===
{{main|Fritz Joubert Duquesne}}
[[File:Fbi duquesne.jpg|right|thumb|FBI file photo.]]
Born in [[Cape Colony]], South Africa, on September 21, 1877, and naturalized a citizen of the United States in 1913, Fritz Joubert Duquesne was a [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] in the [[Second Boer War]]&lt;ref name="Ronnie1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ronnie|first=Art|year=1995|title=Counterfeit hero: Fritz Duquesne, adventurer and spy|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=1-55750-733-3|oclc=605599179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a [[Colonel]] in the [[Abwehr]], Germany’s division of military intelligence.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Peter|year=2014|title=Double Agent|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4516-6795-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duquesne was captured and imprisoned three times by the British, once by the Portuguese, and once by the Americans in 1917, and each time he escaped.&lt;ref name="Ronnie1995"/&gt; In [[World War I]], he was a spy and ring leader for Germany and during this time he sabotaged British merchant ships in South America with concealed bombs and destroyed several.&lt;ref name="Ronnie1995"/&gt; Duquesne was also ordered to assassinate an American, [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], Chief of Scouts for the British Army, but failed to do so.&lt;ref name="chances"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burnham|first=Frederick Russell|authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham|title=Taking Chances|publisher=Haynes Corp|year=1944|location=Los Angeles, California|page=293|isbn=1-879356-32-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as "''The man who killed Kitchener''" since he claimed to have sabotaged and sunk [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']], on which [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] was en route to Russia in 1916.&lt;ref name="clementwood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Clement|title=The man who killed Kitchener; the life of Fritz Joubert Duquesne|year=1932|publisher=William Faro, Inc.|location=New York|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1934, Duquesne became an intelligence officer for the Order of 76, an American pro-Nazi organization, and in January 1935 he began working for U.S. government’s [[Works Progress Administration]]. Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the [[Abwehr]], knew Duquesne from his work in World War I and he instructed his new chief of operations in the U.S., Col. [[Nikolaus Ritter]], to make contact. Ritter had been friends with Duquesne back in 1931 and the two spies reconnected in New York on December 3, 1937.&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt;

On February 8, 1940, Ritter sent Sebold, under the alias of Harry Sawyer, to New York and instructed him to set up a shortwave radio-transmitting station and to contact Duquesne, code-named DUNN.&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt; 

Once the FBI discovered through Selbold that Duquesne was again in New York operating as a German spy, director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] provided a background briefing to President [[Franklin Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt; FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, using the name Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near [[Central Park]] and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt; But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, "The Duke had been a spy all of his life and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him&amp;nbsp;... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door and keep going on right around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, walk back to the ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building."&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt; Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt;

In a letter to the ''Chemical Warfare Service'' in Washington, D.C., Duquesne requested information on a new [[gas mask]]. He identified himself as a "well-known, responsible and reputable writer and lecturer".  At the bottom of the letter, he wrote, "Don't be concerned if this information is confidential, because it will be in the hands of a good, patriotic citizen."  A short time later, the information he requested arrived in the mail and a week later it was being read by intelligence officers in Berlin.&lt;ref name="williambreur"&gt;{{cite book|last=Breuer|first=William B.|title=The Spy Who Spent the War in Bed: And Other Bizarre Tales from World War II|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-26739-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served his sentence in [[Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Kansas]], where he was mistreated and beaten by other inmates. In 1954, he was released due to ill health, having served 14 years, and died indigent, at City Hospital on [[Welfare Island]] (now [[Roosevelt Island]]), New York City on May 24, 1956, at the age of 78.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014" /&gt;

===Max Blank===
[[File:Fbi maz blank.jpg|right|thumb|FBI file photo.]]
Blank boasted to agent Sebold that he had been in the espionage business since 1936, but that he had lost interest in recent years because payments from Germany had fallen off.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/duquesne-spy-ring|title=Duquesne Spy Ring - FBI|date=May 19, 2016|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blank pleaded guilty to violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He received a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

===Heinrich Clausing===
Around 1938, Heine was recruited to find American automobile and aviation industry secrets that could be passed to Germany through the Duquesne Spy Ring.&lt;ref name="FBI2016" /&gt;

Later it was discovered that Heine was also the mysterious "Heinrich" who supplied the spy ring with aerial photographs.&lt;ref name="FBI2016" /&gt;

After obtaining technical books relating to magnesium and aluminum alloys, Heine sent the materials to Heinrich Eilers. To ensure safe delivery of the books to Germany in case they did not reach Eilers, Heine indicated the return address on the package as the address of Lilly Stein.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

Upon conviction of violating the Registration Act, Heine received a $5,000 fine and a 2-year prison sentence

===Herman W. Lang===
[[File:Fbi herman w lang.jpg|right|thumb|85px|FBI file photo]]
Herman W. Lang had participated with [[Adolf Hitler]] in the Munich [[beer hall putsch]] of 1923.&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt; 

Until his arrest, Lang had been employed by the Carl L. Norden Corp., which manufactured the [[Classified information#Top Secret (TS)|top secret]] [[Norden bombsight]]. Ritter then hid the plans in the wooden casing for an umbrella, and, on January 9, 1938, personally handed the umbrella off to a German steward and secret courier on the ship ''Reliance'' bound for [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt;

The Norden bombsight had been considered a critical wartime instrument by the [[United States Army Air Forces]], and American bombardiers were required to take an oath during their training stating that they would defend its secret with their own life, if needed.&lt;ref name="Ross: ''Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II''"&gt;Ross: ''Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II''&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps because of Lang that the bombsight instruments used by [[Luftwaffe]] bombers during the war were fairly similar to the United States' Norden bombsight.

The Lotfernrohr 3 and the BZG 2 in 1942 used a similar set of [[gyroscopes]] that provided a stabilized platform for the bombardier to sight through, although the more complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot was not used. Later in the war, Luftwaffe bombers used the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] [[Lotfernrohr 7]], or Lotfe 7, which had an advanced mechanical system similar to the Norden bombsight, but was much simpler to operate and maintain.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} At one point, Sebold was ordered to contact Lang as it became known that the technology he had stolen from Norden was being used in German bombers. The Nazis offered to spirit him to safety in Germany, but Lang refused to leave his home in [[Ridgewood, Queens]].&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt;

Upon conviction, Lang received a sentence of 18 years in prison on espionage charges and a two-year concurrent sentence under the Registration Act. Lang was deported to Germany in September 1950.&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt;

===Evelyn Clayton Lewis===
[[File:Fbi evelyn clayton lewis.jpg|right|thumb|FBI file photo.]]
A native of [[Arkansas]], Evelyn Clayton Lewis had been living with Duquesne in New York City. Lewis had expressed her anti-British and [[anti-Semitic]] feelings during her relationship with Duquesne. She was aware of his espionage activities and condoned them. While she was not active in obtaining information for Germany, she helped Duquesne prepare material for transmittal abroad. Upon a guilty plea, Lewis was sentenced to serve one year and one day in prison for violation of the Registration Act.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

===Rene Emanuel Mezenen===
[[File:Fbi rene emanuel mezenen.jpg|right|thumb|FBI file photo.]]
Rene Emanuel Mezenen, a [[French people|Frenchman]], claimed U.S. citizenship through the naturalization of his father. Prior to his arrest, he was employed as a steward in the [[Pan Am Airlines|Pan American]] transatlantic clipper service.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

The [[Abwehr|German Intelligence Service]] in Lisbon, Portugal, asked Mezenen to act as a courier, transmitting information between the United States and Portugal on his regular commercial aircraft trips. As a steward he was able to deliver documents from New York to Lisbon in 24 hours. He accepted this offer for financial gain. In the course of flights across the Atlantic, Mezenen reported his observance of convoys sailing for England. He also became involved in smuggling [[platinum]] from the United States to Portugal.  When discussing his courier role with agent Sebold, Mezenen boasted that he hid the spy letters so well that if they were found it would have taken two to three weeks to repair the airplane.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

Following a plea of guilty, Mezenen received an eight-year prison term for espionage and two concurrent years for registration violations.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

===Carl Reuper===

Sebold had delivered microphotograph instructions to Roeder, as ordered by German authorities. Roeder and Sebold met in public places and proceeded to spots where they could talk privately. In 1936, Roeder had visited Germany and was requested by German authorities to act as an espionage agent. Primarily due to monetary rewards he would receive, Roeder agreed.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

Among the Sperry development secrets Roeder disclosed were the blueprints of the complete radio instrumentation of the new Glenn Martin bomber, classified drawings of range finders, blind-flying instruments, a bank-and-turn indicator, a navigator compass, a wiring diagram of the Lockheed Hudson bomber, and diagrams of the Hudson gun mountings.&lt;ref name="evans2014"/&gt; From Roeder the Abwehr also obtained the plans for an advanced automatic pilot device that was later used in Luftwaffe fighters and bombers.* &lt;ref name="CIA2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Fischer|title=A.k.a.

Waalen gathered information about ships sailing for England. He also obtained a confidential booklet issued by the FBI which contained precautions to be taken by industrial plants to safeguard national defense materials from sabotage. He secured government contracts listing specifications for materials and equipment, as well as detailed sea charts of the United States Atlantic coastline.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

In May 1941, the [[SS Robin Moor|SS ''Robin Moor'']] was carrying nine officers, 29 crewmen, seven or eight passengers, and a commercial cargo from New York to [[Mozambique]] via South Africa, without a protective convoy.  On 21 May, the ship was stopped by [[German submarine U-69 (1940)|''U-69'']] in the tropical Atlantic 750 miles west of the British-controlled port of [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Although the SS ''Robin Moor'' was flying the flag of a neutral country, her [[chief mate|mate]] was told by the U-boat crew that they had decided to "let us have it." After a brief period for the ship's crew and passengers to board her four lifeboats, the U-boat fired a torpedo and then shelled the vacated ship.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Once the ship sank beneath the waves, the submarine's crew pulled up to Captain W.E. Myers' lifeboat, left him with four tins of ersatz bread and two tins of butter, and explained that the ship had been sunk because she was carrying supplies to Germany's enemy. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In October 1941, federal prosecutors adduced testimony that Waalen, one of the fourteen accused men who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, had submitted the sailing date of the SS ''Robin Moor'' for radio transmission to Germany, five days before the ship began her final voyage.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1940, Zenzinger received a pencil for preparing invisible messages for Germany in the mail from Siegler. He sent several letters to Germany through a mail drop in Sweden, outlining details of national defense materials.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

Zenzinger was arrested by FBI agents on April 16, 1941. Pleading guilty, he received 18 months in prison for violation of the Registration Act and 8 years' imprisonment for espionage.&lt;ref name="FBI2016"/&gt;

==Liaisons to the Duquesne Spy Ring==
===Takeo Ezima===
[[File:Takeo Ezima.jpg|right|thumb|Takeo Ezima discusses intelligence documents with Abwehr agent Harry Sawyer (FBI agent Sebold), 1941.]]
Lieut Commander '''Takeo Ezima''' of the Imperial Japanese Navy operated in New York as an engineer inspector using the name: E. Satoz;&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt; code name: KATO.&lt;ref name="USNavy1941"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Intelligence and Propaganda in the United States during 1941|url=http://www.mansell.com/eo9066/1941/41-12/IA021.html|year=1941|publisher=Counter Subversion Section, Office of Naval Intelligence, Navy Department|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived on the Heian Maur in Seattle in 1938.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt; On October 19, 1940, Sebold received a radio message from Germany that CARR (Abwehr Agent Roeder) was to meet E. Satoz at a Japanese club in New York.&lt;ref name="chicagotrib1942"&gt;{{cite web| title=Reveal Nazi-Jap Spy Link in U.S. prior to Dec. 7: Tell how Tokio Agent fled as FBI raided ring|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1942/09/21/page/7/article/reveal-nazi-jap-spy-link-in-u-s-prior-to-dec-7|date=September 21, 1942|publisher=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezima was filmed by the FBI while meeting with agent Sebold in New York, conclusive evidence of German-Japanese cooperation in espionage, in addition to meeting with Kanegoro Koike, Paymaster Commander of the Japanese Imperial Navy assigned to the Office of the Japanese Naval Inspector in New York.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roehner2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roehner|first=Bertrand M.|title=Relations between Military Forces and the Population of Hawaii|url=http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~roehner/och.pdf|year=2014|publisher=University of Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezima obtained a number of military materials from Duquesne, including ammunition, a drawing of a hydraulic unit with pressure switch A-5 of the Sperry Gyroscope, and an original drawing from the Lawrence Engineering and Research Corporation of a soundproofing installation, and he agreed to deliver materials to Germany via Japan.&lt;ref name="USNavy1941"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roehner2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newark2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newark|first=Tim|title=The Mafia at War: The Shocking True Story of America's Wartime Pact with Organized Crime|year=2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British had made the Abwehr courier route from New York through Lisbon, Portugal difficult, so Ezima arranged an alternate route to the West Coast with deliveries every two weeks on freighters destined for Japan.&lt;ref name="chicagotrib1942"/&gt;

As the FBI arrested Duquesne and his agents in New York in 1941, Ezima escaped to the West Coast, boarded the Japanese freighter Kamakura Maru, and left for Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Newark2013"/&gt; One historian states that Ezima was arrested for espionage in 1942 and sentenced to 15 years;&lt;ref name="Roehner2014"/&gt; however, U.S Naval Intelligence documents state that "at the request [of] the State Department, Ezima was not prosecuted."&lt;ref name="USNavy1941"/&gt;

===Nikolaus Adolph Fritz Ritter===
[[File:Nikolaus Ritter.jpg|right|thumb|115px|Nikolaus Ritter, 1940.]]
Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant colonel) Nikolaus Ritter led spy rings in the United States, Great Britain, and North Africa from 1936 to 1941. Ritter was born in Germany and had served as an officer in the First World War on the Western Front in France where he was twice wounded. He emigrated to New York in 1924, married an American, and returned to Germany in 1936 to join the Abwehr as Chief of Air Intelligence based in Hamburg operating under the code name: DR. RANTZAU.

He first met Fritz Duquesne in 1931, and the two spies reconnected in New York on December 3, 1937. Ritter also met Herman Lang while in New York, and he arranged for Lang to later go to Germany help the Nazis finish their version of the topsecret [[Norden bombsight]]. Ritter achieved several major successes with the Abwehr, most notably the Norden bombsight, in addition to an advanced aircraft auto-pilot from the Sperry Gyroscope Company, and also intelligence operations in North Africa in support of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]. But some of Ritter's recruits became double-agents who catastrophically exposed his spy rings.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt;

Ritter recruited William Sebold who later joined the FBI which resulted in the arrest of the 33 Abwehr agents of the Duquesne Spy Ring.  In Great Britain, he recruited [[Arthur Owens]], code named JOHNNY, who became an agent for [[MI5]] (British Intelligence) operating under the code name SNOW. Owens exposed so many Abwehr covert agents operating in Britain that by the end of the war MI5 had enlisted some 120 double agents. Although Ritter was never captured, it was the arrest of the Duquesne Spy Ring that ultimately resulted in Ritter's fall from the Abwehr and his reassignment in 1942 to air defenses in Germany for the remainder of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Duffy2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">'''Failure to refer''', also '''reference failure''' or '''failure of reference''', is the concept that names can fail to name a real object. According to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s theory of truth, there is only one actual world, and a statement's [[truth value]] depends on whether the statement obtains in the actual world. Continuing the tradition of [[Gottlob Frege]], Bertrand Russell posited that a name picks out, or refers to, a real object in the world (Russell's [[correspondence theory of truth]]). The name ''[[Genghis Khan]]'' thus picks out the 12th and 13th century [[Mongol]] leader we know by that name. Any sentence in which we attach a predicate to the name ''Genghis Khan'' is true if the predicate obtained in the actual world. Any sentence in which the predicate does not obtain for Genghis Khan is false.  The Wikipedia statement “''Genghis Khan founded the largest contiguous empire in world history''” is thus true, and the statement “''Genghis Khan was [[Oscar Wilde|one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London]]''” is false.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-674-29966-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas G. Pavel|title=Fictional Worlds|year=1986|publisher=Harvard College|isbn= 0-674-29966-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example for a name that fails to refer to a real object, Russell used “''the present king of France''“ in a 1905 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bertrand Russell| title=On Denoting| journal=Mind| year=1905| volume=14| pages=479–493| url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html| doi=10.1093/mind/xiv.4.479}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Truth values in fictional world==
=== Distinguishing between fictional statements and false statements ===
According to the Russellian theory of reference, the statement  “[[Long John Silver]] has a wooden leg” and the statement “[[moon|Earth's moon]] has a diameter of 2856 kilometers” are both false. The first statement suffers reference failure, because it fails to pick out an individual in the actual world. The second sentence refers to an object in the actual world, but the predicate does not obtain in the actual world. Russell's theory thus does not assign different [[truth-value]]s to the two statements.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-674-29966-3"/&gt;

=== True and false statements in fiction ===
In the Russellian system, the statement “Long John Silver has a wooden leg” and the statement “Long John Silver was one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London” have the same truth value: false. This equality may present problems for those wishing to distinguish such statements in terms of truth value.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-674-29966-3"/&gt;

=== Real referents in fictional worlds ===
Some statements are false with reference to the actual world but potentially true in reference to some fictional world.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0-674-29966-3"/&gt;
[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] poem "[[Kubla Khan]]" ("In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree") does not, strictly speaking, suffer reference failure. The 18th century version of the name Kublai Khan picks out a Mongol emperor, the grandson of Genghis Khan. But since few of the events in Coleridge's narrative poem obtain in the actual world, according to Russellian logic, most statements in the poem are false.

A '''focus of infection''' is a place containing whatever epidemiological factors are needed for transmission of an infection. Any focus of infection will have a source of infection, and other common traits of such a place include a human community, a vector population, and environmental characteristics adequate for spreading infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Porta |editor-first1=M |editor1-link=Miquel Porta |editor2-last=Greenland |editor2-first=S |editor3-last=Hernán |editor3-first=M |editor4-last=dos Santos Silva |editor4-first=I |editor5-last=Last |editor5-first=JM |year=2008 |title=A dictionary of epidemiology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kZmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 |edition=6th |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=112 |isbn=978-0-19-997672-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of foci of infection==

===Water pump in 1854 London===
[[File:John Snow memorial and pub.jpg|thumb|right|This pump on [[Broadwick Street]] is a monument to public health intervention]]
{{main|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
In 1854 London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] discovered that people who drank from a particular water pump contracted [[cholera]], and proposed that drinking this water from this pump was the cause of the illness.&lt;ref name="Ghost Map"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Steven |authorlink1=Steven Johnson (author)|title=[[The Ghost Map|The ghost map : the story of London's most terrifying epidemic--and how it changed science, cities, and the modern world]]|date=2006|publisher=Riverhead Books|location=New York|isbn=1594489254|edition=[1st pbk. ed., 14th print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time people did not readily believe [[germ theory of disease]], instead favoring [[miasma theory]].&lt;ref name="Ghost Map"/&gt; The discovery of the water pump as a source of infection set a precedent which helped establish epidemiology as a science.&lt;ref name="Ghost Map"/&gt;

===Gay bathhouses, particularly in 1980s===
A [[gay bathhouse]] is a place where [[men who have sex with men]] meet for sex. In the 1980s at the advent of [[HIV/AIDS]] many men who used bathhouses for sex developed AIDS as a consequence of their having sex without using [[safe sex]] practices for the [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Binson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=editors|first1=William J. Woods, Diane Binson,|title=Gay bathhouses and public health policy|date=2003|publisher=Harrington Park Press|location=New York|isbn=1560232730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, public health policies found bathhouses to be a place to target for public health intervention.&lt;ref name="Binson"/&gt;

===Child daycare===
[[Childcare infection]] is the spread of infection during [[childcare]], typically because of contact among children in [[daycare]] or school.&lt;ref name=Nesti&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesti|first1=MM|last2=Goldbaum|first2=M|title=Infectious diseases and daycare and preschool education|journal=Jornal de Pediatria|date=Jul–Aug 2007|volume=83|issue=4|pages=299–312|pmid=17632670|doi=10.2223/jped.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens when groups of children meet in a childcare environment, and there any individual with an infectious disease may spread it to the entire group. Commonly spread diseases include [[influenza-like illness]] and enteric illnesses, such as diarrhea among babies using diapers. It is uncertain how these diseases spread, but [[hand washing]] reduces some risk of transmission and increasing hygiene in other ways also reduces risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren-Gash|first1=C|last2=Fragaszy|first2=E|last3=Hayward|first3=AC|title=Hand hygiene to reduce community transmission of influenza and acute respiratory tract infection: a systematic review.|journal=[[Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses]]|date=Sep 2013|volume=7|issue=5|pages=738–49|pmid=23043518|doi=10.1111/irv.12015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=MB|last2=Greig|first2=JD|title=A review of enteric outbreaks in child care centers: effective infection control recommendations.|journal=[[Journal of Environmental Health]]|date=Oct 2008|volume=71|issue=3|pages=24–32, 46|pmid=18990930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">A '''form book''' is a tool used by [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to aid in the filing of [[pleading]]s, [[Motion (legal)|motions]] and other [[legal document]]s with a [[court]] or similar decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=https://law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/legalforms/|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form book may be a bound volume or binder containing loose-leaf pages, containing forms, clauses and model documents that the attorney might use when preparing a legal document or court pleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunsch|first1=Kelly|title=Drafting Legal Documents: A Resource Guide|url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/btg/2001/drafting.htm|website=Seattle University Law Library|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Due to the exacting nature of legal forms and the time and effort required to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics Of Court Forms And Filings|url=http://www.civillawselfhelpcenter.org/self-help/getting-started/48-basics-of-court-forms-and-filings|website=Civil Self-Help Center|publisher=Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.

Forms can contain standard language to be used in court proceedings, or may more closely resemble a template which is to be filled in based on case specifics. Forms found in form books are often used as a reference, as the document that will be used must be tailored specifically to the court and situation in which it will be presented.  In some cases, such as [[patents|patent]] and [[bankruptcy]], certain forms are legally required.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/formbks|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form books may be arranged chronologically, alphabetically, by subject, or by [[jurisdiction]]. They may also include additional resources such as outlines, research references, annotations, state considerations, and law practice checklists in addition to the forms.

The style, format, and information required in court documents differs from one jurisdiction to another, between different levels of courts in a system, and between different areas of law. Therefore, the companies that publish [[casebooks|casebook]] and other legal materials often publish form books as well, offering selections specific to the location and type of practice in which their customers are engaged. Many publishers offer the forms in their books on computer discs. Some books may be accompanied by CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs.

The advent of the [[Internet]] has lessened demand for printed form books. Many forms are now distributed freely by various courts, and others are available for free or online purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Finding Free Legal Forms Online - And Using Them Safely|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/research/legal_forms.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Catey|title=Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=MarketWatch|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms online may be offered with drafting tools and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FYI: Document Assembly|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/docassembly.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Form Books==
There are several different categories of form books available. These differ in their organization, subject, and the nature of the information contained.

===General Form Books===
General form books usually fall into one of two categories: transactional, or covering pleading and practice processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Form Books|url=http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|website=Cooley Law School|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517065143/http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional (or legal) forms give examples of [[contract]]s, [[Will (law)|wills]], [[lease]]s, [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]], and other substantive matters. Pleading and practice forms provide formatting and examples for legal language to be used in various court motions such as complaints, answers, and motions to dismiss. General form books are not state specific, and are annotated and cross-referenced. They are usually arranged alphabetically or encyclopedically and may provide a topical index to aid researchers in finding specific forms.

===Form Books for Specific Subjects or Proceedings===
Publishers can provide form books that discuss a specific type of practice. Topics which might have their own form books include [[real estate]], [[business law]], and [[taxes|tax]].

===Form Books Specific to Geographic Jurisdictions===
Most states have form books containing state-specific forms. These can be published by various entities such as state courts or individual [[state bar|state bar association]] organizations. Other court systems may publish their own materials as well.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Forms|url=http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=456|website=Florida Southern District Court|publisher=U.S. Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Types of Form Books===
Another type of form book is designed for those seeking legal forms but not trained as lawyers, commonly referred to as a “self-help” form book.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"/&gt; Topics included could be leases, wills, and contracts.

==Topics Covered in Form Books==
Typical forms included in a form book are a model [[complaint]], [[answer (law)|answer]], motion to compel [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], motion for [[summary judgment]], and request for permission to [[appeal]]. Other types of forms include:
Transactional forms used to draft wills, contracts, and documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=Elizabeth|title=Form Books|url=http://guide.library.law.emory.edu/practicing_attorney|website=Hugh F. McMillan Law Library|publisher=Emory Law|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary Edward''' "'''Garrison'''" '''Keillor''' (born August 7, 1942) is an American author, storyteller, [[humorist]], voice actor, and radio personality. He is best known as the creator of the [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (called ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show'' in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town [[Lake Wobegon]], the setting of many of his books, including ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]] ''and ''[[Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories]]''. Other creations include [[Guy Noir]], a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in ''A Prairie Home Companion'' comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program ''[[The Writer's Almanac]]'', which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.

In November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for ''A Prairie Home Companion''. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'' to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of ''The Writer's Almanac'' on his website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:GarrisonKeillor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Keillor in 2010, wearing his signature red shoes]]

Keillor was born in [[Anoka, Minnesota]], the son of Grace Ruth (''née'' Denham) and John Philip Keillor. His father was a carpenter and postal worker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Joyce | last=Wadler| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/07/HOG8GJ8NBR1.DTL | title=Where all the rooms are above average / Garrison Keillor's home not a little house on the prairie |work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California| date=June 7, 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414130150/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F06%2F07%2FHOG8GJ8NBR1.DTL | archivedate=April 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsend.com/cd/fp/help/0,,1_36877_36882_37199_,00.html Landsend.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403023558/http://www.landsend.com/cd/fp/help/0%2C%2C1_36877_36882_37199_%2C00.html |date=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was half-[[Canadians|Canadian]] with [[English people|English]] ancestry; Keillor's paternal grandfather was from [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/19169102.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+26%2C+1996&amp;author=By+Peter+Goddard+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Garrison+Keillor+sounds+at+home+on+CBC+Radio&amp;pqatl=google |title=Garrison Keillor sounds at home on CBC Radio |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1996-02-26 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/keillor.html |title=Ancestry of Garrison Keillor |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308163850/http://www.wargs.com/other/keillor.html |archivedate=March 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] emigrants from [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irss.uoguelph.ca/article/download/176/218 Irss.uoguelph.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109201408/http://www.irss.uoguelph.ca/article/download/176/218 |date=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2012/07/grace-keillor-mother-of-garrison-passes-away-at-age-97.shtml |title=Grace Keillor, mother of Garrison, passes away at age 97 &amp;#124; State of the Arts &amp;#124; Minnesota Public Radio News |publisher=Minnesota.publicradio.org |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018220007/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2012/07/grace-keillor-mother-of-garrison-passes-away-at-age-97.shtml |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keillor's family belonged to the [[Plymouth Brethren]], an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] movement that he has since left. In 2006, he told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that he was attending the St. John the Evangelist [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], after previously attending a [[Lutheran]] church in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/movies/interviews/2006/garrisonkiellor.html?start=2 |title=From the Radio to the Big Screen |publisher=Christianity Today |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Room|url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/about/press|website=Prairiehome.publicradio.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713173959/http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/about/press/|archivedate=July 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keillor graduated from [[Anoka High School]] in 1960 and from the [[University of Minnesota]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in English in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Keillor| first=Garrison| date=April 15, 2010| title=Post to the Host: 7th Grade Report| work=A Prairie Home Companion| url=http://www.publicradio.org/columns/prairiehome/posthost/2010/04/15/some_facts.php| accessdate=2010-09-05| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921042203/http://www.publicradio.org/columns/prairiehome/posthost/2010/04/15/some_facts.php| archivedate=September 21, 2010| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as [[Radio K]].

In his 2004 book ''Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America'', Keillor mentions some of his noteworthy ancestors, including [[Joseph Crandall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keillor | first = Garrison | authorlink = | title = Homegrown Democrat | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 2004 | location = New York | pages = 39–40, 84 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-303768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was an associate of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], who founded [[Rhode Island]] and the first American [[Baptist]] church; and [[Prudence Crandall]], who founded the first African-American women's school in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keillor | first = Garrison | authorlink = | title = Homegrown Democrat | publisher = Penguin Books | year= 2004 | location = New York | page = 84 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-303768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Radio===
Garrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio (MER), later [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR), which today distributes programs under the [[American Public Media]] (APM) brand. He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called ''A Prairie Home Entertainment'', on KSJR FM at [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota|Collegeville]]. The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual [[classical music|classical]] fare. During this time he submitted fiction to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, where his first story for that publication, "Local Family Keeps Son Happy," appeared in September 1970.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news|first=J. Y.|last=Lee|title=Garrison Keillor:  A Voice of America|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=Jackson, Mississippi|year=1991|ISBN=978-0-878-054732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keillor resigned from ''The Morning Program'' in February 1971 in protest of what he considered interference with his musical programming; as part of his protest, he played nothing but the [[Beach Boys]]' "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]" during one broadcast. When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed ''A Prairie Home Companion''.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

Keillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MER announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' with live musicians.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keillor to Quit Daily Show, Others Leave KSJN|work=[[Minneapolis Tribune]]|publisher=Star Tribune Media Company LLC|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|date=August 24, 1973|page=14B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (''PHC'') debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show is punctuated by spoof commercial spots for [[A Prairie Home Companion#Sponsors|''PHC'' fictitious sponsors]] such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM);&lt;ref&gt;''Garrison Keillor,'' pp. 35, 85. University Press of Mississippi, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; it presents parodic serial melodramas, such as ''The Adventures of [[Guy Noir]], Private Eye'' and ''The Lives of the Cowboys.'' Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show airs from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].

After the show's intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called ''The News from Lake Wobegon'', a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's own hometown of [[Anoka, Minnesota]], and on [[Freeport, Minnesota|Freeport]] and other small towns in [[Stearns County, Minnesota]], where he lived in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Garrison | last = Keillor | authorlink = Garrison Keillor | title = In Search of Lake Wobegon | publisher = Viking Studio | location = New York| year = 2001 | pages = 12–13 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-670-03037-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Wobegon]] is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place "... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average."

[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|thumb|left|Keillor with [[Richard Dworsky]] on the 40th anniversary of ''A Prairie Home Companion'']]
The original ''PHC'' ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, ''The American Radio Company of the Air'', which had essentially the same format as ''PHC''. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to ''A Prairie Home Companion''; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |title=A Prairie Home Companion |publisher=A Prairie Home Companion |access-date=2016-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115070843/https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |archivedate=November 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a typical broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Keillor's name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor reads, he gives himself no billing or credit except "written by [[Cerebellum|Sarah Bellum]]," a joking reference to his own brain.

Keillor regularly takes the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically features local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show''.) Keillor has produced broadcast performances similar to ''PHC'' but without the "Prairie Home Companion" brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonbachfestival.com/pressroom/news/267|title=Oregon Bach Festival pressroom|accessdate=August 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128155233/http://oregonbachfestival.com/pressroom/news/267|archivedate=November 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the host of ''[[The Writer's Almanac]],'' from 1993 to 2017, which, like ''PHC'', was produced and distributed by American Public Media.

This tour this summer is the farewell tour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/garrison-keillor-retire-prairie-home-2016-article-1.2298464|title=Garrison Keillor to retire from 'Prairie Home' in 2016|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723170139/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/garrison-keillor-retire-prairie-home-2016-article-1.2298464|archivedate=July 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
At age thirteen, Keillor adopted the pen name "Garrison" to distinguish his personal life from his professional writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/mnauthors/index.php/10001072 |title=Minnesota Author Biographies: Garrison Keillor |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417214633/http://collections.mnhs.org/mnauthors/index.php/10001072 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commonly uses "Garrison" in public and in other media.
[[File:2016GK.jpg|thumb|Keillor in 2016]]
Keillor has been called "[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life" by [[Randall Balmer]] in ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism.''&lt;ref&gt;Randall Balmer: ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism''. Revised and expanded edition 2004, Baylor University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. In addition to writing for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' he has written for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' and ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0012/feature5/index.html |title=In Search of Lake Wobegon @ |publisher=Nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211061532/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0012/feature5/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written for [[Salon.com]] and authored an [[Agony aunt|advice column]] there under the name "Mr. Blue." Following a heart operation, he resigned on September 4, 2001, his last column being titled "Every dog has his day":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Laura |last=Miller |url=http://www.salon.com/books/col/keil/2001/09/04/adieu/index.html |title=Every dog has his day |work=[[Salon.com]] |publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=September 4, 2001 |accessdate=March 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126114425/http://www.salon.com/books/col/keil/2001/09/04/adieu/index.html |archivedate=January 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Illness offers the chance to think long thoughts about the future (praying that we yet have one, dear God), and so I have, and so this is the last column of Mr. Blue, under my authorship, for Salon. Over the years, Mr. Blue's strongest advice has come down on the side of freedom in our personal lives, freedom from crushing obligation and overwork and family expectations and the freedom to walk our own walk and be who we are. And some of the best letters have been addressed to younger readers trapped in jobs like steel suits, advising them to bust loose and go off and have an adventure. Some of the advisees have written back to inform Mr. Blue that the advice was taken and that the adventure changed their lives. This was gratifying.

So now I am simply taking my own advice. Cut back on obligations: Promote a certain elegant looseness in life. Simple as that. Winter and spring, I almost capsized from work, and in the summer I had a week in [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Mary's Hospital]] to sit and think, and that's the result. Every dog has his day and I've had mine and given whatever advice was mine to give (and a little more). It was exhilarating to get the chance to be useful, which is always an issue for a writer (What good does fiction do?), and Mr. Blue was a way to be useful. Nothing human is beneath a writer's attention; the basic questions about how to attract a lover and what to do with one once you get one and how to deal with disappointment in marriage are the stuff that fiction is made from, so why not try to speak directly? And so I did. And now it's time to move on.}}

In 2004 Keillor published a collection of political essays, ''Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America,'' and in June 2005 he began a column called ''The Old Scout'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmsfeatures.com/columns/political/liberal/garrison-keillor/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113155530/http://www.tmsfeatures.com/columns/political/liberal/garrison-keillor/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-13 |title=Liberal - Political |publisher=www.tmsfeatures.com |accessdate=2015-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ran at Salon.com and in [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010 so that he "... [could] finish a screenplay and start writing a novel."

Keillor wrote the screenplay for the 2006 movie ''[[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]],'' directed by [[Robert Altman]]. He also appears in the movie.

===Bookselling===
On November 1, 2006, Keillor opened an [[independent bookstore]], "Common Good Books, G. Keillor, Prop." in the [[Blair Flats|Blair Arcade Building]] at the southwest corner of Selby and N. Western Avenues in the Cathedral Hill area in the [[Summit-University]] neighborhood of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Webb|first=Tom|title=Keillor's bookstore outgrows St. Paul space and will move to Macalester College campus|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_19456988|accessdate=May 28, 2013|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=December 2, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213129/http://www.twincities.com/ci_19456988|archivedate=October 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon opening the bookstore, Keillor wrote this poem:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Good Books Opens at Macalester|url=http://www.macalester.edu/news/2011/12/common-good-books-opens-at-macalester|accessdate=January 29, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122834/http://www.macalester.edu/news/2011/12/common-good-books-opens-at-macalester/|archivedate=January 30, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|
A bookstore is for people who love books and need
To touch them, open them, browse for a while,
And find some common good – that's why we read.
Readers and writers are two sides of the same gold coin.
You write and I read and in that moment I find
A union more perfect than any club I could join:
The simple intimacy of being one mind.
Here in a book-filled room on a busy street,
Strangers — living and dead — are hoping to meet.

===Voice-over work===
Probably owing in part to his distinctive [[North-Central American English|North-Central]] accent, Keillor is often used as a [[voice-over]] actor. Some notable appearances include:
* Voiceover artist for Honda UK's "the Power of Dreams" campaign. The campaign's most memorable advertisement is the 2003 [[Honda Accord]] commercial ''[[Cog (television commercial)|Cog]]'', which features a [[W. Heath Robinson|Heath Robinson]] contraption (or [[Rube Goldberg Machine]]) made entirely of car parts. The commercial ends with Keillor asking, "Isn't it nice when things just work?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeclub.co.uk/prelogin/mg.aspx?m=tv&amp;r=208543&amp;ref= Creativeclub.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929010925/http://www.creativeclub.co.uk/prelogin/mg.aspx?m=tv&amp;r=208543&amp;ref= |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Keillor has voiced the tagline for most if not all UK Honda advertisements, and even sang the voiceover in the 2004 Honda Diesel commercial ''[[Grrr (advert)|Grrr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|puGvk1RgmrE|Grr Commercial}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent ad was a reworking of an existing commercial with digitally added England flags to tie in with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Keillor's tagline was "Come on, England, keep the dream alive."

==Reception==
In ''[[Slate.com|Slate]]'', Sam Anderson called Keillor "very clearly a genius. His range and stamina alone are incredible—after 30 years, he rarely repeats himself—and he has the genuine wisdom of a [[Bill Cosby|Cosby]] or [[Mark Twain]]." But Keillor's "willful simplicity," Anderson wrote, "is annoying because, after a while, it starts to feel prescriptive. Being a responsible adult doesn't necessarily mean speaking slowly about tomatoes." Anderson also noted that in 1985, when ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called Keillor the funniest man in America, [[Bill Cosby]] said, "That's true if you're a [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|pilgrim.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Anderson|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2006/06/a_prairie_home_conundrum.html|title=A Prairie Home Conundrum|date=June 16, 2006|work=Slate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211155047/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2006/06/a_prairie_home_conundrum.html|archivedate=February 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Keillor's style, particularly his speaking voice, has often been [[parody|parodied]].
*''[[The Simpsons]]'' parodied him in [[Marge on the Lam|an episode]] in which the family is shown watching a Keillor-like monologist on television; they are perplexed at why the studio audience is laughing so much, prompting [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to ask "What the hell's so funny?" and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to suggest "Maybe it's the TV." Homer then hits the set, exclaiming: "Stupid TV! Be more funny!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F03.html Snpp.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204084357/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F03.html |date=December 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of ''A Prairie Home Companion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnrosengren.net/garrison-keillor |title=Garrison Keillor |publisher=John Rosengren |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313055253/http://www.johnrosengren.net/garrison-keillor |archivedate=March 13, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor [[stroke]]. He returned to work a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walsh |first=Paul |title=Minor stroke puts Keillor in hospital |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/style/58076947.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUs |publisher=''[[Star Tribune]]'' |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070138/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/style/58076947.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O%3ADW3ckUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUUs |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
In 2005, Keillor's attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to MNSpeak.com regarding their production of a T-shirt bearing the phrase "A Prairie Ho Companion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=Higgins|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2005/09/lake-o-be-gone-sean-higgins/|title=Lake-O-Be-Gone|work=[[National Review]]|publisher=National Review, Inc.|location=New York City|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after a visit to a [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist church]] in [[Highland Park, Texas]], Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umportal.org/main/article.asp?id=1252 Umportal.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229215707/http://www.umportal.org/main/article.asp?id=1252 |date=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of [[torture]] and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: "I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church and that it would be better if I didn't talk about politics." In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two "burly security men" were a local policeman and the church's own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor's publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jacquielynn|last=Floyd|title=Keillor's Dallas jabs read like fictional tale|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/localnews/columnists/jfloyd/stories/100506dnmetfloyd.71c17bc.html|work=[[Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=[[A.H.

Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Wilonsky|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/and-he-sounds-like-such-a-nice-boy-on-the-radio-7121351|title=And He Sounds Like Such a Nice Boy on the Radio ...|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|location=Dallas, Texas|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized "stereotypical" gay parents, who he said were "sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Garrison|last=Keillor|authorlink=Garrison Keillor|url=https://www.salon.com/2007/03/14/keillor_81/|title=Stating the obvious|work=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=Salon Media Group Inc.|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:

{{quote|I live in a small world – the world of entertainment, musicians, writers – in which gayness is as common as having brown eyes ... And in that small world, we talk openly and we kid each other a lot. But in the larger world, gayness is controversial ... and so gay people feel besieged to some degree and rightly so ... My column spoke as we would speak in my small world, and it was read by people in the larger world and thus the misunderstanding. And for that, I am sorry.

In 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbor's plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for "light and air" and a view of "open space and beyond". Keillor's home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbor's with its planned addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike|last=Nizza|url=https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/garrison-keillor-leaves-home-for-greener-prairies/ |title=Garrison Keillor Leaves Home for Greener Prairies |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=February 26, 2015|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anthony|last=Lonetree|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/13973526.html |title=Mediation ends Keillor's feud with neighbor |work=[[Star Tribune]] |publisher=Star Tribune Media Company LLC|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|date=January 23, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190613/http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/13973526.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, one of Keillor's "Old Scout" columns contained a reference to "lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys" and a complaint about "[[Silent Night]]" as rewritten by [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]s, upsetting some readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Garrison|last=Keillor|authorlink=Garrison Keillor|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-12-16/news/bal-op.keillor16dec16_1_silent-night-unitarian-christmas |title=Garrison Keillor Christmas &amp;#124; Nonbelievers, please leave Christmas alone |work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320191950/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-12-16/news/bal-op.keillor16dec16_1_silent-night-unitarian-christmas |archivedate=March 20, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, "Listening to him talk about us over the years, it's becoming more and more evident that he isn't laughing with us — he's laughing at us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cynthia|last=Landrum |url=http://revcyn.blogspot.com/2009/12/garrison-keillor-is-no-companion-for.html?m=0 |title=Rev.

==== Separation from MPR ====
On November 29, 2017, the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported that [[Minnesota Public Radio]] was terminating all business relationships with Keillor as a result of "allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him." In January 2018, MPR CEO Jon McTaggart elaborated that they had received allegations of "dozens" of sexually inappropriate incidents from the individual, including requests for sexual contact.&lt;ref name="mpr-yuen"&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Laura|last1=Yuen |first2=Matt|last2=Sepic|first3=Euan|last3=Kerr|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/01/23/keillor-workplace |title=For some who lived in it, Keillor's world wasn't funny |work=[[MPR News]] |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]]|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=January 23, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123220449/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/01/23/keillor-workplace |archivedate=January 23, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keillor has denied any wrongdoing and said his firing stems from an incident when he touched a woman's bare back while trying to console her. He stated he apologized to her soon after, that they had already made up, and that he was surprised to hear the allegations when her lawyer called.

In its statement of termination, MPR announced that Keillor would keep his executive credit for the show, but that since he owns the trademark for the phrase "prairie home companion", they would cease rebroadcasting episodes of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' featuring Keillor and remove the trademarked phrase from [[A Prairie Home Companion with Chris Thile|the radio show hosted by Chris Thile]].

==== Settlement and access to archived shows ====

Keillor received a letter from the MPR CEO, Jon McTaggart, dated April 5, 2018, confirming that both sides wanted archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'' to be publicly available again. The archives were restored at the end of April 2018, to be hosted by MPR for no longer than three years per the agreement between Keillor and MPR, after which the archives will move to a new online home.&lt;ref name="Settlement"&gt;{{cite web |first1= Laura |last1=Yuen|first2=Euan|last2=Kerr |url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/04/13/mpr-reaches-agreement-with-keillor-on-public-access-prairi-home-companion-writers-almanac |title=MPR-Keillor deal preserves Prairie Home, Writer's Almanac archives |work=[[MPR News]] |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]]|date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gheo-shih''' (5000 BC-3000 BC), which translates to “''River of the Gourd Trees''” in the [[Zapotec language]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Andrew. “The Oldest Ritual?” American Archaeology, (2005). Andrew Lawler. 28 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  is an open-air site found in the [[Oaxaca Valley]] that holds what is considered as the earliest representation of civic-ceremonial architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Susan Toby. Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this site is a cleared area lined by boulders that is thought to have been used for rituals, dances or athletic competitions.  This site could have held 25-30 people&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. “''The Coevolution of Ritual and Society: New 14C Dates from Ancient Mexico.''” PNAS (2004). 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to be a congregation site for microbands during the rainy seasons of the Archaic period.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Geography==

Gheo-Shih is located in the Oaxaca Valley, which is in the Southwestern highlands of present day Mexico.  The site is roughly 100 by 150 m (about 1.5 ha),&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. The Radiocarbon Dating of Public Buildings and Ritual Features in the Ancient Valley of Oaxaca. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and has an elevation of 1,660 m.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. “The Coevolution of Ritual and Society: New 14C Dates from Ancient Mexico.” PNAS (2004). 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  During the rainy season (June through September) there was an abundance of mesquite pods and fruit as well as planted squash and gourds.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Susan Toby. Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological History==

Excavation of Gheo-shih began in 1967 through the University of Michigan, the lead archaeologists were Frank Hole&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Bryan Jon. “Gheo-shih: An Ancient Pre-Columbian Plaza.” Landscape Research 17 (1992): 74-78. Taylor &amp; Francis Online. 28 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife team Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus.  Original excavation found two stratigraphic components, the uppermost being dated to 5000-4000 BC and the lower portion being dated to roughly 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. “The Coevolution of Ritual and Society: New 14C Dates from Ancient Mexico.” PNAS (2004). 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation of the lower section uncovered the most prominent feature of the site, a set of parallel lines of boulders 7 by 20 m in size, this cleared area was almost completely devoid of artifacts.  Although there are many theories of what this area may have been used for, the most commonly accepted are those of Flannery and Marcus.  In correlation with the understanding of the social structure and culture of micro/macrobands Flannery and Marcus believe that this open area was used for rituals, dances and possibly athletic competitions.  This theory correlates with the understanding that macroband rituals of the Archaic period were “ad hoc,” meaning that they were not associated with dates or times but performed when there was the largest number of people possibly present.    

Also found at this site were [[metate]] and [[mano (stone)]] fragments, [[atlatl]] points as well as areas of lapidary work with pebbles and chipped stone manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. The Radiocarbon Dating of Public Buildings and Ritual Features in the Ancient Valley of Oaxaca. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also oval rings of stone that are believed to be the remnants of walls from residential structures.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Susan Toby. Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these finds were found around the cleared area.

The dates for this site were found using [[Carbon-14]] dating on two pieces of charcoal, most likely burnt twigs, found in the lower stratified portion.  The dates associated with these pieces are 7630-7570 BC and 7720-7560 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. The Radiocarbon Dating of Public Buildings and Ritual Features in the Ancient Valley of Oaxaca. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Significance==

===Social Structure===

Gheo-shih is thought to have been occupied during the Archaic period when bands and microbands were prominent.  Archaeologists think that at this time family-sized microbands spent lean seasons apart from each other and then came together at larger sites during abundant seasons to form macrobands.  Because of archaeological evidence such as abundant food sources and evidence of nonsubsistence actives such as lapidary work, Gheo-shih  is thought to be one of these larger sites occupied by macrobands.  It is also believed that when these macrobands were formed “ad hoc” rituals and/or athletic competitions would be performed because the maximum number of people would be present.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. “The Coevolution of Ritual and Society: New 14C Dates from Ancient Mexico.” PNAS (2004). 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  This explains the common theories behind Gheo-shih's main feature, the boulder lined cleared area.

===Lapidary Work===

There is archaeological evidence of lapidary work at Gheo-shih.  Small pebbles with carved holes in them have been found and it is believed that these were mainly decorative ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Susan Toby. Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joyce and Kent V. Flannery. “The Coevolution of Ritual and Society: New 14C Dates from Ancient Mexico.” PNAS (2004). 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  This find is significant as it shows that the people living there had the time and manpower to devote to nonsubsistence related activities.  This as well supports the macroband theory.

==Controversy==

There is some controversy surrounding Gheo-shih in the field of archaeology.  Some archaeologists disagree with Flannery and Marcus' theories about the boulder lined cleared area found there.  Many argue that the rocks could have moved over time, or that with many time periods represented in one place it is hard to distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Andrew. “The Oldest Ritual?” American Archaeology, (2005). Andrew Lawler. 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologist Marcus Winter from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History in Oaxaca believes that the boulders may in fact be a road built in the Spanish colonial times.  Marcus argues  in response that there are no other artifacts from the colonial times found at that site and that there is distinct stratigraphy to demarcate time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Andrew. “The Oldest Ritual?” American Archaeology, (2005). Andrew Lawler. 28 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ac dirkhartogplate.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Original of Dirk Hartog's plate in the [[Rijksmuseum]]]]
'''Hartog Plate''' or '''Dirk Hartog's Plate''' is either of two plates, although primarily the first, which were left on [[Dirk Hartog Island]] during a period of [[European maritime exploration of Australia|European exploration]] of the western coast of Australia prior to European settlement there.  The first plate, left by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Dirk Hartog]], is the oldest-known artifact of European exploration in Australia still in existence. The original dish was returned to the Netherlands where it is on display in the [[Rijksmuseum]].  A replacement and additional dish were subsequently discovered on three additional visits over the next 200 years

==Dirk Hartog, 1616==

Dirk Hartog was the first confirmed European to see Western Australia, reaching it in his ship, the ''[[Eendracht (1615 ship)|Eendracht]]''.  On 26 October 1616, he landed at Cape Inscription on the very northernmost tip of the island. Before departing, Hartog left behind a [[pewter]] dinner plate, nailed to a post and placed upright in a fissure on the cliff top.

The plate bears the inscription:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1616, DEN 25 OCTOBER IS HIER AENGECOMEN HET SCHIP D EENDRACHT&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated into English:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Willem de Vlamingh, 1697==
[[File:Shark Bay.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Shark Bay area showing Dirk Hartog Island and Cape Inscription]]

81 years later, in 1697, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] sea captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] also reached the island and discovered Hartog's pewter dish with the post almost rotted away.  He removed it and replaced it with another plate which was attached to a new post.  The new post was made of a cypress pine trunk taken from [[Rottnest Island]].&lt;ref name=VOCHS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.voc.iinet.net.au/hartog.htm|title= Dirck Hartogh and his discovery of Western Australia|publisher= VOC Historical Society|location= [[Perth, Western Australia]]|accessdate= 12 November 2006|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050703083633/http://www.voc.iinet.net.au/hartog.htm|archivedate= 3 July 2005|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original dish was returned to the Netherlands, where it is still kept in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]. De Vlamingh's replacement dish contains all of the text of Hartog's original plate as well as listing the senior crew of his own voyage.  It concludes with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

==Emmanuel Hamelin, 1801==
In 1801, the French captain of the ''Naturaliste'' [[Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin]], second in command of an expedition led by [[Nicolas Baudin]] in the ''Geographe'' entered [[Shark Bay]] and sent a party ashore. The party found Vlamingh's plate, even though it was half buried in the sand, as the post had rotted away with the ravages of the weather. When they  took the plate to the ship, Hamelin ordered it to be returned, believing its removal would be tantamount to sacrilege. He also had  a plate, or similar, of his own prepared and inscribed with details of  his voyage (at 16 July 1801) and he had both erected at the  Vlamingh site, adding even a small Dutch flag to the plaque. It was then named Cape Inscription.&lt;ref name=VOCHS/&gt;

==Louis de Freycinet, 1818==
In 1818 in the ''Uranie'', French explorer [[Louis de Freycinet]], who had been an officer in Hamelin's 1801 crew, sent a boat ashore to recover Vlamingh's plate and substituted a lead plate, which has never been found.&lt;ref name=VOCHS/&gt; His wife Rose de Freycinet, who was on board, having stowed away with her husband's assistance,  recorded the event in what was in effect a diary of her circumnavigation.&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, M.S., 1996, ''A Woman of Courage: The journal of Rose de Freycinet on her voyage around the world 1817–1820''. National Library of Australia. Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being shipwrecked in the Falkland Islands  the plate and other materials from the ''Uranie'' voyage were later transferred to another ship and taken to  France, where it was presented to the [[Académie française]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/uranie/rose_etc.html The Uranie Voyage] at Western Australian Marine Museum, Fremantle&lt;/ref&gt;

After being lost for more than a century, the Vlamingh plate was rediscovered in 1940 on the bottom shelf of a small room, mixed up with old copper engraving plates.{{Where?|date=October 2016}}  In recognition of Australian losses in the defence of France during the two world wars, the plate was eventually returned to Australia in 1947 and is currently housed in the [[Western Australian Museum|Western Australian Maritime Museum]] in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=VOCHS/&gt;

==Cape Inscription Lighthouse plaques==
Marking the location in 1938, the Commonwealth government commemorated Dirk Hartog's landing with a brass plaque.

Just short of 60 years later, on 12 February 1997, the then premier of Western Australia [[Richard Court]] unveiled a bronze plaque to mark the tricentennial of Vlamingh's visit.&lt;ref&gt;Playford 1998 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

The lighthouse and plaques are located at {{Coord|25|28|55|S|112|58|19|E|region:AU-WA_type:landmark|display=inline}}.

'''Incremental reading''' is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, helping with the creation of [[flashcard|flashcards]] out of electronic articles read in portions inside a prioritized reading list.

It is particularly targeted to people who are trying to [[lifelong learning|learn for life]] a large amount of information, particularly if that information comes from various sources.

"Incremental reading" means "reading in portions". Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. Articles in the reading list are prioritized by the user.

In the course of reading, key points of articles are broken up into [[flashcard|flashcards]], which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period of time with the help of a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.

This use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on psychological principles of [[long-term memory]] storage and retrieval, in particular the [[spacing effect]] (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the [[testing effect]] (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing).

Current implementations include [[spaced repetition]] software [[Anki (software)|Anki]] – through an add-on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and [[SuperMemo]]. There is also incremental reading support for the text editors [[Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalReading |title=Incremental Reading |publisher=EmacsWiki |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yi (editor)|Yi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://code.haskell.org/yi/src/Yi/Mode/IReader.hs&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The method itself is often credited to the Polish software developer [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]. He implemented the first version of incremental reading in 1999 in [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 99]], providing the essential tools of the method: a prioritized reading list, and the possibility to extract portions of articles and to create [[Cloze test|cloze deletions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 99 made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing reading lists and the first primitive reading tools: extracts and clozes. Reading lists are prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts make it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions. Clozes make it possible to convert short sentences into question-answer format by means of cloze deletions.|accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "incremental reading" itself appeared the next year with [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 2000 greatly increased the efficiency of reading by introducing the concept of incremental reading.|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later SuperMemo programmes subsequently enhanced the tools and techniques involved, such as webpage imports, material overload handling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited incremental reading support for the text editor [[Emacs]] appeared in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=IncrementalReading|title=Emacs Wiki: recent changes to "Incremental Reading"|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Anki (software)|Anki]] add-on for incremental reading was later published in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frankraiser.de/drupal/AnkiIR|title=Anki Incremental reading|author=Frank Raiser|date=2011-03-15|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Anki 2.0 and 2.1, another add-on is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incremental reading was the first of a series of related concepts invented by [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]: incremental image learning, incremental video, incremental audio, incremental mail processing, incremental problem solving, and incremental writing. "Incremental learning" is the term Wozniak uses to refer to those concepts as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Components_of_incremental_learning|title=Components of incremental learning|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

When reading an electronic article, the user extracts the most important parts (similar to underlining or highlighting a paper article) and gradually distills them into [[flashcards]]. Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making [[active recall]] possible). [[Cloze deletions]] are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create out of text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.

With time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts, and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.

Contrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with [[active recall]]. This means that extracts such as "George Washington was the first U.S. President" must ultimately be converted into questions such as "Who was the first U.S. President?" (Answer: George Washington), or "Who was George Washington?" (Answer: the first U.S. President), etc, or [[cloze deletion|cloze deletions]] such as "[BLANK] was the first U.S. President", "George Washington was [BLANK]", etc.

This flashcard creation process is semi-automated – the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions, while the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards, and does the scheduling: it calculates the ideal time for the reader to review each chunk, according to the rules of [[spaced repetition]]. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.

Individual articles are read in portions proportional to the [[attention span]], which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piotr Wozniak |url= https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm#Attention|title=Advantages of incremental reading: attention|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.

[[Image:Dolmen plaque Mont de la Ville Jersey.jpg|thumb|In 1785 part of Le Mont de la Ville was levelled as a parade ground, which led to the discovery of a dolmen which the [[Vingtaine de la Ville]] presented to the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]], Marshal Conway, who subsequently transported it to his estate at [[Henley-on-Thames]] where it was re-erected. As it is now a [[Listed building|listed monument]] in the United Kingdom, attempts to have it returned to Jersey have been to no avail.]]
The '''dolmens of Jersey''' are [[neolithic]] sites, including [[dolmen]]s, in [[Jersey]]. They range over a wide period, from around 4800 BC to 2250 BC, these dates covering the periods roughly designated as Neolithic, or “new stone age”, to [[Chalcolithic]], or “copper age”.

Before that, the dolmen [[La Cotte de St Brelade]] has evidence of habitation both by our near cousins, the [[Neanderthal]]s, and early man. These come from the [[Paleolithic]] or “old stone age”, and belong to the period of the hunter-gatherer, where the tribe would forage in pursuit of food. In the case of La Cotte, as we know from remains, [[woolly mammoth]] was part of the diet.

==History of dolmens in Jersey==

By the time the dolmens came to be built, people were settled in Jersey, although it was still at that time connected by a [[land bridge]] to the continent of Europe (until around 6800 BC). The new stone age differs from the old in that stone tools were still used – axes, daggers etc. – but the community was now settled and farmed the land; they did not hunt and follow prey.

Of their habitations, no trace remains; it is likely from the evidence found elsewhere that they had fairly basic wooden huts, sealed with mud and clay, which have been lost. Only the dolmens and [[menhir]]s remain.

The Neolithic sites such as dolmens, [[passage grave]]s and the like used to be considered to be primarily tombs of chieftains.

Possibly drawing from the Egyptian model, a tribe was imagined as labouring away to build a burial site of stone for a mighty chieftain, much as the workers in Egypt had done for the pharaohs. Beliefs of ancient Egypt have survived in written form, and it seems clear that the embalmed body of the king was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife, and a place among the gods. A new pharaoh would mean a new tomb, a new pyramid, often built in fairly close proximity to others.

But the Neolithic sites do not seem to function like that. They are scattered. There is no easy way of seeing that someone was special, singled out. Bodies were often defleshed (left so that the flesh rotted away) or burnt before interment. Ancient Jewish burials – where a tomb was used – then the bones gathered up and placed in a burial casket – show a similarity of practice.

This is also completely unlike Celtic burials, where tribal chieftains were often buried with their chariots, and [[grave goods]] ( though horses were apparently usually too valuable to bury with their owner). It is immediately clear with these burials that they were for a man of stature and importance within the tribe. The one site – unfortunately inaccessible – in Jersey where this is seen is Hougue Boete.

But with the dolmens, as [[Mark Patton (archaeologist)|Mark Patton]] has pointed out, the human remains found are few in number, and sometimes (as La Sergenté) non-existent. This is also the case in [[Brittany]], where animal bones can be found, and not human bones, suggesting that these "passage graves" were never intended for burials, and certainly not for burials of chieftains. On the most prominent Jersey site,  he comments: “the bones are scattered in the passage and chamber with no apparent organisation, as at La Hougue Bie, Jersey”..
 
In fact, on many sites in Britain and Europe, over the Neolithic period, these tombs were opened and new interments made. One site had five different methods of burial for only twice that number of people.

So if these sites were not tombs, what were they for? Mark Patton suggest that a useful analogy is that of churches and cathedrals. He argues: "If one were to excavate [[Westminster Abbey]], one would find human bones, as in most cathedrals and churches, yet Westminster Abbey, although it contains burials, would not in itself be described as a tomb or [[mausoleum]]", and suggests that we look at the dolmens in this light. The historian Ronald Hutton comes to much the same conclusion, that these sites were mainly used as religious centres, and each would have been a "focus for a group of scattered farms or a settlement, bonded as a clan or family" - very much a precursor to the idea of a "parish".

So how are to understand the dolmens. Mark Patton suggests that we can imagine the tribes coming together, for various significant times of the year, to celebrate in ritual the passage of the seasons.

Bihet notes that pouques or fairies have a particularly strong connection to the folklore of the dolmens.&lt;ref&gt;-‘Pouques and the Faiteaux: Channel Islands’, Young, S. and Houlbrook, C. (eds.) Magical Folk: British and Irish Fairies 500 AD to the Present (London, 2017), pp. 151-164. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== La Pouquelaye de Faldouet  ===
[[Image:Dolmen du Faldouet panoramic picture Jersey august 2006.jpg|thumb|La Pouquelaye de Faldouet]]
This Neolithic passage grave is in the Parish of [[Saint Martin, Jersey|St Martin]]. It is a 5 metre long passage leading into a large circular chamber beyond which is a large [[Caprock|capstoned]] end chamber. Several smaller side chambers and [[cist]]s form the edges of the main chamber. Human bones from at least three individuals have been recovered as well as pottery, stone axes and [[flint]]s.

=== Les Monts de Grantez ===
[[Image:Dolmen des Monts Grantez, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Les Monts Grantez]]
This Neolithic passage grave is in the Parish of [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St Ouen]].

It has a fine passage chamber with one side chamber to the north. The passage and side chamber retain their capstones. Excavation in 1912 located the skeletons of eight people, seven adult and one child. Seven were lying on their sides in a crouched position and the eighth in a seated position within the passage. Animal bones, pottery, shells and pebbles were also found.

Mark Patton (1987) noted that there was a considerable degree of variation in terms of funerary practices and how the dead were treated. In  Mont Grantez,&lt;ref&gt;(Nicolle et al. 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; "seven articulated skeletons were found (six were in flexed positions in the chamber, the seventh was apparently placed in a seated position in the chamber). Disarticulated remains, however, are more usual, suggesting prior exposure or burial of the corpse."

=== La Sergenté  ===
[[Image:Dolmen La Sergenté, Jersey.jpg|thumb|La Sergenté]]
This unusual passage grave is found in the Parish of [[Saint Brélade, Jersey|St Brelade]]. It is a circular chamber with a short passage entrance. The original excavation in 1923 found a large amount of rubble within that was probably the fallen remains of a [[corbel]]led, bee-hive shaped vault. The style is unique to the [[Channel Islands]].

It is sited on open land west of Le Parcq de L'Oeillière, with a line of sight to La Table des Marthes.

Mark Patton noted that the corbelled vault required a rock such as schist, which fractures to give long, flat slabs, and in Jersey, the available rock was not suitable. Consequently, while La Sergenté is the earliest passage grave in Jersey, it collapsed soon after its construction, because of the unsuitable building materials available, and was not repeated elsewhere in the Islands.(Patton 1987a).

=== La Hougue des Géonnais ===

A neolithic passage chamber in the parish of St Ouen; it was largely ruined by quarrying prior to the initial excavation in 1929. More recent excavations (1985-1990) revealed a D shaped chamber that was extended to form an open rectangular chamber probably in Neolithic times. A vast number of finds included pottery, flint scrapers, arrowheads and broken [[quern-stone|querns]].

Mark Patton comments: “There are three passage graves in Jersey (Le Mont de la Ville, Faldouet and La Hougue des Géonnais) which have large, open chambers. The chambers of these monuments cannot have been roofed with capstones (the uprights are too small to have supported capstones large enough to span the chambers), and corbelled vaulting would be impractical given the character of the available stone. It is conceivable that these chambers had wooden roofs, but recent excavations at La Hougue des Géonnais &lt;ref&gt;(Forrest and Rault forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; provided no evidence for this. Assuming that the chambers were open, the cairns of these monuments cannot have covered the chambers whilst they were in use, and must rather have formed a sort of platform around an open ‘arena’.”

=== La Table des Marthes ===

[[File:La Table des Marthes Jersey.jpg|thumb|La Table des Marthes]]A large flat granite slab at the western end of The Railway Walk where it meets La Rue de la Corbière. When examined in 1850 it was found to be supported at each end by pillars of stones and earth. Pottery, burnt stones and broken stone axes were found. It is unknown what kind of purpose it was used for or what kind of structure it is part of.

It has been suggested that it is a huge capstone from the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age (about 2500 to 3000 BC). In historical times, it was used by the Jersey people as a place for signing contracts. Because of this it may have been allowed to stand by the side of the now disused [[Jersey Railway|St Helier to La Corbière railway]], while so many other sites were partially destroyed for building material.

The name, which may be interpreted as ''La Table des Martyres'' and consequently translated as "The Witnesses' Table", probably derives from this known custom of signing important documents at the slab.

=== Le Pinacle ===
{{main|Le Pinacle}}
[[Image:Le Pinacle Jersey.jpg|thumb|Le Pinacle]]
Le Pinacle is a natural rock formation that resembles a gigantic [[menhir]]. The site itself is positioned below the imposing Le Pinacle, which is on the west of Le Chemin des Landes. The path down to the site is treacherous, and in recent times has seen two tragic deaths. It is inadvisable to go down unless with properly qualified climbers.

There are two earth and rubble ramparts that archaeologists have attributed to the Neolithic/Chalcolithic periods and a third that they have attributed to the [[Bronze Age]]. Six pieces of iron found at the site have been attributed to [[Iron Age]] occupation. In Roman times the site held a rectangular [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Fanum|Gallo-Roman temple]]. Amongst the large number of finds from various excavations are flints, hammers, rubbers, polishing stones, a copper arrow head, bronze spear head, wheel turned pottery and a Roman coin.

Mark Patton comments: “Recent research&lt;ref&gt;Renouf and Urry 1986, Patton 1987a and in press&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated the existence of an axe production centre at Le Pinacle, Jersey, and ‘Type P’ [[dolerite]] axes produced at Le Pinacle have been identified in assemblages from Guernsey, Sark and Alderney as well as Jersey. Axes of Type P dolerite, however, seem not to be found on the [[Armorica]]n mainland. “

=== La Hougue Boëte ===

This is a high oval mound in the Parish of [[Saint John, Jersey|St John]]. Here a four sided Neolithic chamber was found when tunnelled into by excavators in 1911. The cist was found to contain an unusual burial, that of a man lying on top of a horse. Other reported finds included a round bottomed vessel and fragment of a [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] axe. The horse bones were carbon dated to the [[Celts|Celtic]] period. It seems likely that the site was built in Neolithic times then re-used in Celtic times for a chieftain’s burial.

This is the only known megalithic [[cist]] with a round mound of its type in the Channel Islands and may be culturally linked to early Neolithic cists in south Brittany. The site is also of interest as the location of a seigniorial court.

The [[Duke of Normandy]] granted lands here in Jersey to his favoured subjects. They became Seigneur of a [[fief]], often living in a manor house, centrally placed in the area. Anyone living in a fief became a 'tenant' paying rent to the church (usually a tenth of their grain crops) and working for an agreed number of days on the Seigneur's land. The system worked well because tenants had the use of the Seigneurial mill, saving them many hours of work, and disputes between tenants were settled by the Seigneurial court. Incidentally, the Seigneur did not preside over the court most of the time, but left it to deputies, or “[[prévôt]]s”.

Originally every Seigneurial Court had its Prévôt. appointed annually on some Fiefs by the Seigneur, on others by the Tenants, "to guard the rights of the Seigneur and the tenants, to make good all summonses and loyal records, and to pay the corn-rentes, fermes, and extracts". He had to enforce all orders of the Court and all bye-laws of the Fief.

=== Mont Ubé ===

This is a Neolithic passage grave in Parish of St Clement.

When it was discovered it 1848, the capstones were blasted and removed by quarrymen for building materials. Inside were found   human bones, urns, axes and a polished stone pendant. The local farmer who was responsible for the blasting then used the remaining upright stones as a pigsty until it was reclaimed as a historic site.

=== Le Couperon ===
[[Image:Dolmen du Couperon, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Le Couperon]]
This is a gallery grave in the Parish of St Martin. Le Couperon is about an eight-meters long capstoned chamber that a long mound had originally covered. It was surrounded by a ring of eighteen outer stones, known as peristaliths. It was well-known at least as early as 1748 as [[Daniel Defoe]] mentions it in his tour guide to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Defoe (1748), p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first excavated in 1868. By that time the capstones had fallen into the chamber. The excavators lifted these and a porthole stone, and restored the dolmen to what the excavators believed was its original form. Unfortunately, a farmer digging up the mound had scattered the peristaliths.  In 1919, the Société Jersiaise moved the porthole stone to its current position at the eastern end of the chamber. However, archeologists believe that originally porthole stone may have stood within the chamber, dividing it into two segments of unequal length, each with its own entrance. Finds at the site included a few flint flakes and pottery fragments.

The dolmen stands within a few metres of the [[Le Couperon guardhouse]], which was built in 1689, and which for more than a century off-and-on housed the garrison of a nearby battery.

== Beaker People or Culture? ==

When [[Jacquetta Hawkes]] wrote "The Archaeology of the Channel Islands", she mentioned "the [[Beaker people]]" who spread across Europe, possibly from the [[Iberian peninsula]]. They were defined by a distinctive pottery style - a beaker with a distinctive bell-shaped profile - that spreads across the Western continent around 2000 B.C. Burial customs of the Beaker people included placing their dead in round barrows, often with a beaker, perhaps to hold a drink for the dead on their final journey. Evidence of such beakers and artefacts have been found in Jersey at Ville ès Nouaux.

The existence of the migratory "Beaker people" is still very much the popular position. Richard R. Doornek writing in the magazine "School Arts" in 1989 on [[Stonehenge]] mentions that about 2100 BC, "the Beaker people, named after their highly sophisticated pottery, arrived in Britain from the Continent through the Low Countries. Geoffrey Humphrys also writes on Stonehenge in the magazine "Contemporary Review" (1994), and again we hear that "about 2100 BC, the Beaker people are reckoned to have started erecting two circles of bluestones".

But many historians and archaeologists now believe that the Beaker people did not exist as a group; as Mark Patton explains, the beakers and related artefacts that are attributed to the Beaker people may well indicate the migration of a "beaker culture" rather than a "beaker people". This is most succinctly summed up by Ronald Hutton:

"One of the major developments in British archaeology during the past twenty years has been the loss of confidence by its practitioners in their ability to recognise the movement of peoples. The problem is that an existing population can adopt foreign artefacts and fashions so completely as to appear to have been replaced by foreigners. Thus, according to traditional archaeological practice, had modern Britain been an illiterate society then it would have been natural to have spoken of the invasion of the 'Washing Machine People' in the 1950s and large-scale Japanese immigration in the 1970s."

The recent discovery of the burial of the "[[Amesbury Archer]]" in Wiltshire, however, has brought the idea of a "Beaker people" to the fore again. This individual was clearly a high status male, buried with copper tools and gold jewellery as well as beakers, and oxygen isotope analysis on his teeth indicates that he grew up in central Europe, possibly Switzerland or Austria. Immigration clearly happened, but not necessarily on a large scale: the arrival of a small number of immigrants, bringing with them new technologies, skills and ideas, may have provoked a profound change in the nature of society.

==Philately==
In 2012, Jersey Post issued a five-stamp set of stamps, designed by Andrew Robinson, each of which featured one of five dolmens: Mont Ubé, Le Couperon, Ville-és-Nouaux, Les Monts Grantez and La Pouquelaye de Faldouet. Le Couperon is on the 55 pence stamp.

{{Neolithic|258}}
The '''Levantine corridor''' is the relatively narrow strip between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the northwest and [[desert]]s to the southeast which connects [[Africa]] to [[Eurasia]]. This corridor is a land route of migrations of animals between Eurasia and Africa. In particular, it is believed that early [[hominin]]s [[Out of Africa I|spread from Africa]] to [[Eurasia]] via the Levantine corridor and [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Goren-Inbar, John D. Speth (eds.), "Human [[Paleoecology]] in the Levantine Corridor". 1994, {{ISBN|1-84217-155-0}} ([http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/vos_de_j_2006_review_of_goren_inbar_n_and_jd_speth_eds_2004_human_paleoecology_in_the_levantine_corridor_published_by_oxbow_books.pdf book review])&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor is named after the [[Levant]].

The Levantine Corridor is the western part of  the [[Fertile Crescent]], the eastern part being [[Mesopotamia]].

Botanists recognize this area as a dispersal route of [[flora|plant]] species.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yosef O. Pleistocene connections between Africa and Southwest Asia: an archaeological perspective,  ''[[African Archaeological Review]]'', 1987, vol. 5, pp. 29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups suggests that during the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods, the Levantine corridor was more important for bi-directional human migrations between Africa and Eurasia than was the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p000-0130.pdf J.

The '''Luzira Head''' is the name of a [[terracotta]] head found at [[Luzira]], [[Uganda]]. Estimated to be about 1000 years old, it one of the oldest [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-saharan]] sculptures yet discovered in [[Africa]]. Since 1931, it has been part of the British Museum's [[ethnographic]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=593988&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=buganda&amp;page=1|title=The Luzira Head|website=British Museum|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Luzira Head is a unique terracotta [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of a woman. The head has very narrow, protruding eyes and mouth with a diminutive nose. Along the forehead are three [[cicatrices]]. The [[hair]] is matted and falls either side of the head. The lower part of the figure was also found during the original excavations. It is [[tripod]]-shaped and like the head is hollow and made of baked [[clay]].

==Discovery==
The head and torso, along with a number of other artefacts, were excavated by the British [[geologist]] EJ Wayland between 1929 and 1930. They were unearthed in a [[prison]] compound at the site of Luzira, in the suburbs of [[Kampala]], Uganda. Other objects discovered at the time included over one hundred pottery [[sherds]], fourteen terracotta pieces, a pottery vessel, an iron spear and an axe. It is conjectured that the site was once an ancient [[Buganda]] shrine. [[Radio-carbon dating]] has indicated that the objects found there are approximately a thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/082/ant0820099.htm|title=Antiquity - Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madonna of the Fish''''', known also as '''''Madonna with the Fish''''' is a painting by the [[High Renaissance]] master [[Raphael]]. 

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] sits enthroned with the [[Jesus]] on her knee. On one side is [[St. Jerome]] kneeling by the Lion; he is holding a book. On the other side the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] is presenting at the foot of the throne the young [[Tobias]], whom he formerly guided to the [[River Tigris]], and who bears the miraculous fish whose heart, liver and gall were to restore his father's sight, and drive the demons from his bride. Tobias with his fish was an early type of baptism. Raphael leading Tobias always expresses protection, and especially protection to the young. The picture is believed to have been painted around 1512-14 to commemorate the introduction of [[Book of Tobit]] to the canonical books of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. St. Jerome translated the Book of Tobit into [[Latin]], which explains his presence on the right of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;1912 review of ''Madonna and the Fish'' on {{cite web |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910003010/http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merheleva Ridge''' ({{lang-uk|Мергелева гряда}}, also transliterated ''Mergeleva'', literally "Marlstone Ridge", "Marl Ridge") is the site of an [[Eneolithic]]  temple and burial complex consisting primarily of four large stone mounds or [[kurgan]]s situated near [[Perevalsk]], [[Luhansk oblast]], [[Ukraine]], about 30&amp;nbsp;km to the west-to-southwest of the city of [[Luhansk]]. "Merheleva" is the Ukrainian adjective from the word ''merhel'', [[marlstone]], which is a type of [[limestone]] common in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Bublyk, M. ''[http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/zagadkova_luganshchina_stepova_piamida_ta_printsesa_myurat_2016553 Mysterious Luhansk Region: steppe pyramid and Princess Murat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201195729/http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/zagadkova_luganshchina_stepova_piamida_ta_printsesa_myurat_2016553 |date=2015-02-01 }}''. [[Ukrinform]]. 1 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly the site was built in about 4000 BC, corresponding to the [[Dnieper-Donets culture|Dnieper-Donets]] or early [[Yamna culture]], and remained in use throughout the [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] and well into the Iron Age, until 5th century BC [[Sarmatia]]. It was discovered in 2004, and the discovery officially announced on 7 September 2006.

==Discovery and excavation==

The site was discovered in 2004 by school children participating in an archaeology camp organised by [[Alchevsk]] history teacher Vladimir Paramonov, who has been organising expeditions of schoolchildren to the hill range since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=627&amp;section=19 Neva News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218214734/http://nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=627&amp;section=19 |date=2007-12-18 }} 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that much of the site was constructed about 3000 BC, in the early [[Bronze Age]]. The site is believed to be a complex of temples and sacrificial altars topping a hill with sides sculpted into steps.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Viktor Klochko]], the archaeologist in charge of the dig site and deputy Minister of Science of the Tourism and Protection of Cultural Heritage Department of the Lugansk regional administration, said that the discovery was of international significance as the first monument of its kind found in [[Eastern Europe]]:
:"''It changes our whole conception of the social structure and the level of development of the cattle breeders and farmers who were the direct ancestors of most European peoples.''"

Archaeologists have confirmed that evidence of graves has been found at the Luhansk site, which they believe to have been the result of [[human sacrifice]], rather than due to its use as a burial ground.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

According to ''The Guardian''{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, remains of sacrifice victims, ashes and ceramics have been found at the site, but no jewellery or treasure. The complex has a base area of three-quarters of a square mile, is estimated to be 60 metres (192&amp;nbsp;ft) high, and was probably used for 2,000 years.

In Kurgan No. 4, three graves of the Berezhnovsko-Maevskaya group of the Late Bronze Age [[Srubna culture]] were found above three graves of the Early Bronze Age [[Catacomb culture]], with 13 graves and sacrificial pits. One of the skulls found was dated to ca. 3000 BC. Four [[Kurgan stelae|stone statues]] were found near the graves.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Misidentification as pyramid and clarification==
Initial reports indicated that archaeologists had discovered a [[pyramid]]al structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/science/tech/11-08-2006/83895-pyramids-0 PRAVDA: Ancient pyramids found in Ukraine]; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5322894.stm BBC News: 'Pyramids' discovered in Ukraine]; 
[https://www.theguardian.com/ukraine/story/0,,1867219,00.html Guardian Unlimited: Bronze Age pyramid found in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Klochko blamed the press: "I'm not sure where the pyramid idea came from - the media got it wrong," says Klochko. "We didn't find anything like an [[Egyptian pyramid]]. Though the site is on a hill.  But it's interesting enough in its own right."&lt;ref name="Factcheck"&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0701/trenches/fact.html Fact Check: Ukrainian "Pyramid"], ''Archaeology'', Volume 60 Number 1, January/February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mora''' (plural ''morae'' or ''moras''; often symbolized '''μ''') is a unit in [[phonology]] that determines [[syllable weight]], which in some languages determines [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] or [[timing (linguistics)|timing]]. The definition of a mora varies. In 1968, American linguist [[James D. McCawley]] defined it as "something of which a long syllable consists of two and a short syllable consists of one". The term comes from the [[Latin]] word for "linger, delay", which was also used to translate the Greek word ''chronos'' (time) in its [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] sense.

Monomoraic [[syllable|syllables]] have one mora, bimoraic syllables have two, and trimoraic syllables have three, although this last type is relatively rare.

==Formation==
In general, morae are formed as follows:

# A [[syllable onset]] (the first [[consonant]] or consonants of the syllable) does not represent any mora.
# The [[syllable nucleus]] represents one mora in the case of a short vowel, and two morae in the case of a long vowel or [[diphthong]]. Consonants serving as syllable nuclei also represent one mora if short and two if long. ([[Slovak language|Slovak]] is an example of a language that has both long and short consonantal nuclei.)
# In some languages (for example, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), the [[syllable coda|coda]] represents one mora, and in others (for example, [[Irish language|Irish]]) it does not. In [[English language|English]], the codas of stressed syllables represent a mora (thus, the word ''cat'' is bimoraic), but for unstressed syllables it is not clear whether this is true (the second syllable of the word ''rabbit'' might be monomoraic).
# In some languages, a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong in the nucleus and one or more consonants in the coda is said to be '''trimoraic''' (see [[pluti]]).

In general, monomoraic syllables are called "light syllables", bimoraic syllables are called "heavy syllables", and trimoraic syllables (in languages that have them) are called "superheavy syllables". Some languages, such as [[Old English]] and present-day English, can have syllables with up to four morae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of the English Language|last=Hogg|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-521-26474-X|editor-last=Hogg|editor-first=Richard|volume=1|location=University Press, Cambridge, UK|pages=96|chapter=3 Phonology and Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] stress system in which moraically heavy syllables are assigned stress is said to have the property of quantity sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 6th ed.|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-5296-9|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781444302776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
===Ancient Greek===
{{see|Ancient Greek accent}}
For the purpose of determining accent in [[Ancient Greek]], short vowels have one mora, and long vowels and diphthongs have two morae. Thus long ē ([[eta]]: η) can be understood as a sequence of two short vowels: ee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/412064 The Inflectional Accent in Indo-European]. Paul Kiparsky. ''Language''. Vol. 49, No. 4 (Dec., 1973), pp. 794–849. [[Linguistic Society of America]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek pitch accent is placed on only one mora in a word. An [[acute accent|acute]] (έ, ή) represents high pitch on the only mora of a short vowel or the last mora of a long vowel (''é, eé''). A [[circumflex]] (ῆ) represents high pitch on the first mora of a long vowel (''ée'').

===English===
In Old English, short diphthongs and monophthongs were monomoraic, long diphthongs and monophthongs were bimoraic, consonants ending a syllable were each a mora, and [[Gemination | geminate ]] consonants added a mora to the preceding syllable. In Modern English, the rules are similar, except that all diphthongs are bimoraic. In English, and likely also in Old English, syllables cannot have more than 4 morae, with loss of sounds occurring if a syllable would have more than 4 otherwise. From the Old English period through to today, all [[content word|content words]] must be at least 2 morae long.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg 1992, p. 95-98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luganda===
In [[Luganda]], a [[vowel length|short vowel]] constitutes one mora while a [[vowel length|long vowel]] constitutes two morae. A simple [[consonant]] has no morae, and a [[gemination|doubled]] or [[prenasalised consonant]] has one. No [[syllable]] may contain more than three morae. The tone system in Luganda is based on morae. (See [[Luganda tones]].)

===Gilbertese===
[[Gilbertese]], an Austronesian language spoken mainly in [[Kiribati]], is a trimoraic language.&lt;ref&gt;Juliette Blevins and Sheldon P. Harrison. "Trimoraic Feet in Gilbertese". ''Oceanic Linguistics'', vol. 38, No. 2, December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] in Gilbertese contains three morae. These trimoraic constituents are units of stress in Gilbertese. These "ternary metrical constituents of the sort found in Gilbertese are quite rare cross-linguistically, and as far as we know, Gilbertese is the only language in the world reported to have a ternary constraint on prosodic word size."

===Hawaiian===
In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], both syllables and morae are important. Stress falls on the penultimate mora, though in words long enough to have two stresses, only the final stress is predictable. However, although a [[diphthong]], such as ''oi,'' consists of two morae, stress may fall only on the first, a restriction not found with other vowel sequences such as ''io.'' That is, there is a distinction between ''oi,'' a bimoraic syllable, and ''io,'' which is two syllables.

===Japanese===
{{see also|On (Japanese prosody)}}
Most dialects of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], including the standard, use morae, known in Japanese as ''haku'' (拍) or ''mōra'' (モーラ), rather than syllables, as the basis of the sound system. Writing Japanese in [[kana]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) is said by those scholars who use the term ''mora'' to demonstrate a moraic system of writing. For example, in the two-syllable word ''mōra'', the ''ō'' is a long vowel and counts as two morae. The word is written in three symbols, モーラ, corresponding here to {{not a typo|mo/o/ra}}, each containing one mora. Such scholars also argue that the 5/7/5 pattern of the [[haiku]] in modern Japanese is of morae rather than syllables.

The Japanese syllable-final ''n'' is also said to be moraic, as is the first part of a geminate consonant. For example, the Japanese name for "[[Japan]]", 日本, has two different pronunciations, one with three morae (''Nihon'') and one with four (''Nippon''). In the hiragana spelling, the three morae of ''Ni-ho-n'' are represented by three characters (にほん), and the four morae of ''Ni-p-po-n'' need four characters to be written out as にっぽん.

Similarly, the names ''[[Tokyo|Tōkyō]]'' (''to-u-kyo-u'' とうきょう), ''[[Osaka|Ōsaka]]'' (''o-o-sa-ka'' おおさか), and ''[[Nagasaki]]'' (''na-ga-sa-ki'' ながさき) all have four morae, even though, on this analysis, they can be said to have two, three and four syllables, respectively. The number of morae in a word is not always equal to the number of graphemes when written in kana; for example, even though it has four morae, the Japanese name for ''Tōkyō'' (とうきょう) is written with five graphemes, because one of these graphemes (ょ) represents a [[Yōon]], a feature on the Japanese writing system  that indicates that the preceding mora is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]].

===Sanskrit===
In India, the mora was an acknowledged phenomenon well over two millennia ago in ancient Indian linguistics schools studying the dominant scholarly and religious lingua franca of [[Sanskrit]]. The mora was first expressed in India as the ''mātrā''.{{Sfn|Horace Hayman Wilson|1841|p=427}}{{Sfn|Hopkins|1901|p=193}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Ollett|editor1=Nina Mirnig |editor2=Peter-Daniel Szanto |editor3=Michael Williams | title=Puspika: Tracing Ancient India Through Texts and Traditions| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qZZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA331| year=2013| publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-84217-385-5| pages=331–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the short vowel "''a''" (pronounced like a [[schwa]]) is assigned a value of one mātrā, the long vowel "''ā''" is assigned a value of two mātrās, and the compound vowel (diphthong) "''ai''" (which has either two simple short vowels, "''a''"+"''i''", or one long and one short vowel, "''ā''"+"''i''") is assigned a value of two mātrās.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Sanskrit prosody and metrics have a deep history of taking into account moraic weight, as it were, rather than straight syllables, divided into "''laghu''" (लघु, "''light''") and "''dīrgha''" / "''guru''" (दीर्घ / गुरु, "''heavy''") feet based on how many morae can be isolated in each word.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Thus, for example, the word ''kartŗ'', meaning "agent" or "doer", does not contain, contrary to intuitive English prosodic principles, simply two syllabic units, but contains rather, in order, a "''dīrgha''" / "''guru'' "/ "heavy" [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] and a "''laghu''" / "light" foot. The reason is that the conjoined [[consonants]] 'rt' render the normally light 'ka' [[syllable]] heavy.

'''Nim Li Punit''' ({{IPA|/nim li puˈnit/}}) is a [[Maya Classic Period]] site in the [[Toledo District]] of the nation of [[Belize]], located 40 kilometres north of the town of [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]], at 16° 19' N, 88° 47' 60W. Nim Li Punit is sometimes known as '''Big Hat''' or '''Top Hat'''; the name is [[Q'eqchi' language|Kekchi Maya]] for "Big [[Hat]]", referring to the large elaborate [[head-dress]] on a [[stela]] [[sculpture]] found on site depicting one of the site's ancient kings.

Nim Li Punit is a medium-sized site from the [[Maya Classic Period]], flourishing from the 5th century AD through the 8th century AD. It consists of structures around three [[plaza]]s, including several step-[[pyramid]]s, the tallest being 12.2 meters high. The site has a number of carved [[stela]]e illustrating the ancient city's rulers. Several [[stela]]e are in an [[unfinished work|unfinished]] state, suggesting a sudden halt to work. The site is near Belize's [[Southern Highway]] and is open to visitors subject to an admission charge.

==Geography and geology==
{{Maya civilization}}
Nim Li Punit is situated in the [[foothill]]s of the [[Maya Mountains]] with proximity to clear mountain [[stream]]s. The Maya Mountains form a nearly impenetrable backdrop forest to the north and east, while the expansive somewhat [[swamp]]y [[coast]]al lowlands adjoining the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the east. Low-lying swampland between the [[Sarstoon River|Sarstoon]] and [[Temash River]]s is situated to the south. The site is within two kilometres of Belize's [[Southern Highway]], accessed by an unpaved road. (The Southern Highway itself is paved in the vicinity of the site as well.) Area soils are relatively fertile for tropical standards, and explain the region's ability to support sizeable prehistoric settlements such as Nim Li Punit. Local [[sandstone]]s are found in nearby stream and river beds, and these materials were used as the principal building stones for the site's structures and stelae. The Maya Mountains and foothills are among the oldest surface rock formations of [[Central America]] ; these [[Paleozoic]] [[sediment]]s were uplifted about 200 million years ago in the late [[Carboniferous]] ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]) and early [[Permian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M. Emmons et al., ‘' [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]]'‘, Producciones de la Hamaca, Belize and Orang-utan Press, Gays Mills, Wisconsin, USA (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The ancient city of Nim Li Punit was laid out in a fashion consistent with other Mayan lowland Classic Era sites, such as [[Lubaantun]], [[Pusilha]] and [[Uxbenka]]; the latter two of these sites are deemed to have arisen earlier than the former two. Nim Li Punit is constructed in the Classic Period prototypical geometric form, using large amounts of fill material to achieve expansive level [[plaza]]s and terraces;&lt;ref&gt;''The ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of the Belize Valley: half a century of [[archaeological]] research'', ed. J.F.Garber, [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] University Press of Florida (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the arrangement of the major structures emulates the view of the Mayan cosmological world, setting the earth realm at the core, manifested by a dwelling of the ruler. The sky world is exhibited characteristically in the north by shrines and burial structures. The location of the [[ballcourt]] is intermediary, illustrating the position of this activity to represent perpetual conflict between the forces of life and death. The ballcourt is so well preserved, it appears ready to host a game.

It is thought that within the Plaza of the Stela in the South Group that there is an ''E Group'' geometry that would have been used for astronomical observations. For example, several monuments present before a long terrace known as Structure One, which mark the location of [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. Unlike Lubaantun, where [[dry-stone]] construction was employed, the stone structures are cemented with Mayan [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; moreover, the elaborate notched jointing often found in Lubaantun is absent in Nim Li Punit.&lt;ref&gt;C. M.Hogan, ''Comparison of Mayan sites in southern and western Belize'', Lumina Technologies (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and occupation==
[[Image:Nim Li Punit stela.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Stela with ruler with large head-dress or "Big Hat", namesake of Nim Li Punit]]
The peak population of Nim Li Punit is estimated to have been in the range of 5000 to 7000 people during the peak occupation Late Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;'‘Nim Li Punit'‘, published by the Department of Archaeology, Blmopan, Belize, Project ACP-RPR 544, Cubola Productions, March, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Early occupiers of this site probably migrated from [[Guatemala]], similar to the history of nearby [[Lubaantun]]. The peoples of Nim Li Punit are thought to have spoken a dialect of the [[Cholan]] language, which is that spoken in the Mayan heartland. Evidence from carved stelae document the site was active in the period 721 to 790 AD, based upon actual Mayan calendar dates inscribed on at least six different stones. As at many other Mayan sites occupation of Nim Li Punit ceased rather suddenly in the 9th century AD, probably associated with areawide [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] exceeding the region's [[carrying capacity]] of the then prevalent [[milpa]] farming system.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Awe, ''Maya Cities and Sacred Caves'', Cubola Books {{ISBN|976-8161-11-6}} (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The Nim Li Punit population is thought to have been aligned with Mayan settlements such as Tikal in the [[Petén Basin]] region of Guatemala. The visitors' center indicates that this site had political and social connections with Copan in Honduras.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Nimlipunitviewtoswcmichaelhogan.jpg|thumb|300px|View from southwest edge of Nim Li Punit core looking southwest.]]

Nim Li Punit is situated in a locale rich in [[forest]], soil, rock and other [[natural resources]]. These assets, coupled with proximity to ample flowing mountain [[streams]], provided the aboriginal Maya at Nim Li Punit a resource base that allowed their civilisation to thrive. While most of the surrounding [[broadleaf]] tropical [[rainforest]] is [[secondary growth]], due to the disturbance of the Maya themselves, there is considerable [[biodiversity]] of trees, [[herb]]s, [[mammal]]s, birds, [[reptile]]s and other life forms. In addition to the soils being able to support basic [[prehistoric]] staple [[crop]]s of beans and corn, there are diverse [[herb]]s in the vicinity known to have been used by the "ancient ones" for medicinal purposes.

Mammals found in the area include two [[primate]]s: [[Guatemalan black howler|Yucatán black howler monkey]], ''Alouatta pigra'' and Central American [[spider monkey]], ''Ateles geoffroya''. Numerous [[rodent]]s are found here including the common [[paca]], ''Agouti paca''. A variety of [[carnivore]]s are present, such as the [[cougar]] ''Puma concolor'' and [[jaguar]] ''Panthera onca''.  Further, hosts of bats and birds frequent the present forest as they did the ancient forest.

==Discovery and excavation==
[[Image:Nim Li Punit tomb.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Open tomb at Nim Li Punit]]

Nim Li Punit was discovered in 1976 with initial explorations conducted by Norman Hammond of the [[British Museum]]-[[Cambridge University]]. Hammond produced the first site map and excavated a portion of the central plaza. Barbara McLeod of the [[University of Texas]], Austin, then produced the first detailed analyses of stelae inscriptions. Richard Levanthal in 1983 bored test pits and surveyed the site as part of an overall southern Belize Mayan mapping project. In the 1990s minor [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] were conducted by the Belize Department of Archaeology under the supervision of John Morris and Juan Luis Bonor. In 2015, tomb excavations were conducted by the Toledo Regional Interaction Project directed by Geoffrey Braswell. This excavation unearthed numerous clay pots and a large jade pendant inscribed with [[Mayan hieroglyphs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archaeologists Unearth Tombs at Nim Li Punit|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/114378|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=News 5|date=4 June 2015|location=Belize}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prager|first1=Christian M.|last2=Braswell|first2=Geoffrey E.|title=Maya Politics and Ritual: An Important New Hieroglyphic Text on a Carved Jade from Belize|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|date=28 November 2016|volume=27|issue=2|pages=267–278|doi=10.1017/S095653611600033X|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ancient-mesoamerica/article/div-classtitlemaya-politics-and-ritual-an-important-new-hieroglyphic-text-on-a-carved-jade-from-belizediv/29177447A9DCD86AA07BA4EDF9BF14CE|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">Originally used by Jesuits as a learning aid for students, '''painted enigmas''' are visual riddles - generally speaking, a picture with an easily understood superficial subject that contains a hidden meaning, usually one word.  This differed from similar visual riddles such as the [[emblem]] or hieroglyph ([[Horapollo]]'s "''Hieroglyphica''" for instance)which were simpler in design and intended to represent moral precepts. The emblem and painted enigma were similar in that each usually contained some clue that the composition contained a hidden meaning, usually a "written legend which might be a verbal riddle or rebus to be solved by the same word,or a simple epigrammatic motto such as constituted the 'soul' of the emblem." First developed at the Jesuit college Pont a Mousson in 1588, it developed into an erudite courtly entertainment by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Montagu]], “The Painted Enigma and French Seventeenth-Century Art,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 31 (1968), 307-309, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest verifiable painted enigmas from this era were painted by [[Charles Le Brun]].

The '''Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube''' was a fixture in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]] section of [[Baltimore]], Maryland for over 50 years.

There was a crowded, dusty bookshop in front, and a crowded room in the back where customers could get beer and a sandwich.  There was a piano on one wall, mounted animal heads, wooden tables carved with the names of patrons.  At 10:00 PM, Dantini the Magnificent would do his 15-minute magic show.&lt;ref name="baltimoreorless"&gt;http://www.baltimoreorless.com/2012/01/the-peabody-book-shop-one-for-the-books-or-not/ Baltimore or Less: Retrieved 1 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookshop also served as an art gallery for local artists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/217464579/ Baltimore Sun 2 February 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Located at 913 N. Charles Street, the Peabody was within walking distance of the [[Walters Art Gallery]], the [[George Peabody Library]], the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall]], [[Washington_Monument_(Baltimore)|Baltimore's Washington Monument]], and the Brexton Hotel.

{{Coord|39.3002962|-76.6155467|display=inline,title}}

==Weisberger years==
Brothers Hugo and Siegfried Weisberger, Austrian immigrants, started the bookshop in 1922, during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  Siegfried became sole owner in 1931, when Hugo died.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/26/obituaries/siegfried-weisberger-is-dead-baltimore-bookseller-was-88.html New York Times Obituary Retrieved 13 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an early example of a bookshop with its own beer bar, and possibly the very first such in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/59271-bmore-stores-add-brews-and-food.html Publisher's Weekly Retrieved 15 Fdbruary 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisberger abandoned the Peabody in 1954, convinced by long time patron [[H. L. Mencken]], that the "Age of the Boob" had arrived, and people were no longer interested in "books and ideals and culture. They only want dollars."&lt;ref&gt;https://izi.travel/es/b5b7-peabody-book-shop-and-beer-stube-913-n-charles-st/en  IZI.Travel Retrieved 13 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

When Siegfried walked away from "100,000 volumes nobody wants to read", the news was covered across the nation, from Detroit to Phoenix, Arizona; Wilmington, Delaware to Santa Cruz, California.

==Interregnum==
The Peabody didn’t stay closed.  It reopened under the ownership of Paul P. Adler and Irving 
Mindess, later in 1954, and remained popular with students from the [[University_of_Maryland,_College_Park| University of Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/oldline1954univ/oldline1954univ_djvu.txt Old Line Magazine 1954:  Retrieved 18 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rose Hayes Years==
The oft-married Rose Boyajjian Smith Pettus Hayes took ownership of the shop in 1957 and ran it until she died in 1986.&lt;ref name="baltimoreorless" /&gt;

Rose added a second bar upstairs,&lt;ref name="BS_1997-10-06"&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-06/features/1997279040_1_book-shop-stube-peabody-book/2 Baltimore Sun October 06, 1997: Retrieved 18 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and was active in preserving other Baltimore properties&lt;ref&gt;https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/Baltimore%20City/B-1897.pdf National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service Nomination Form - 913 North Charles Street (Rose B.

In 1979, the Peabody suffered the loss of two long-time performers; singer - violinist Max Rathje who knew every regualar's favorite song, and Vincent Cierkes, popularly known as “Dantini the Magnificent."&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/hanover-evening-sun-mar-19-1979-p-23/ Hanover (Pennsylvania) Evening Sun 19-Mar-1979: Retrieved 26-Feb-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The shop closed not long after Rose's death.

==The End==
The building at 913 North Charles Street was demolished in 1997, to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mencken.org/mencken-society/text/localities/localities.htm Mencken Society: Retrieved 19 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pejorative suffix''' is a [[suffix]] that attaches a negative meaning to the word or word-stem preceding it. There is frequent overlap between this and the [[diminutive]] form.

The pejorative suffix may add the sense of "a despicable example of the preceding," as in Spanish ''-ejo'' (see below). It can also convey the sense of "a despicable human having the preceding characteristic"; for instance, as in English ''-el'' (see below) or the development of the word ''cuckold'' from Old French ''cocu'' "cuckoo" + ''-ald'', taken into Anglo-Saxon as ''cokewald'' and thus to the modern English word.

Examples of the pejorative suffix:

==[[Catalan language|Catalan]]==
-alla -alles   Suffixed to nouns gives new nouns. Examples: ''gentalla'' (from ''gent'' "people"). It's also used as a collective (group) suffix.

-arro -arros (fem. -arra -arres)   Suffixed to nouns gives new nouns. Example: ''veuarra'' (from ''veu'' "voice"). It's also used as an augmentative suffix.

-astre -astres (fem. -astra -astres)   Suffixed to nouns gives new nouns. Example: ''poetastra'' (from ''poeta'' "poet"). This suffix has also the meaning "indirect relation with".

-ot -ots (fem. -ota -otes)   Suffixed to nouns gives new nouns. Example: ''sabatot'' (from ''sabata'' "shoe"). Suffixed to adjectives gives new adjectives. Example: ''lletjot'' (from ''lleig'' "ugly"). As a suffix it also means "object", giving a lexicalized word.

-婊biǎo,e.g.绿茶婊lǜchábiǎo(used to describe a lascivious girl who pretends to be innocent,from 绿茶lǜchá"green tea",which symbolizes innocence)
NOTE:this suffix is from the word 婊子biǎozi"prostitute",so at first word suffixed with 婊 were used to describe only women,but recently it can be used to describe both men and women,for example,圣母婊shèngmǔbiǎo,which means people who pretend to bo as merciful as goddesses on the Internet,from 圣母shèngmǔ"goddess"

The '''Pledge of Allegiance''' of the [[United States]] is an expression of allegiance to the [[flag of the United States]] and the republic of the United States of America. It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army Officer during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = One Nation, Indivisible|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703735804575536041452086002|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 1, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Melanie|last = Kirkpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Captain and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel George T.

[[United States Congress|Congressional]] sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. All states except [[Hawaii]], [[Iowa]], [[Vermont]] and [[Wyoming]] require a regularly scheduled recitation of the pledge in the [[Education in the United States#Public and private schools|public schools]], although the [[Supreme Court (United States)|Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' that students cannot be compelled to recite the Pledge, nor can they be punished for not doing so.&lt;ref name=Crawford2015/&gt; In a number of states, [[Flags of the U.S. states|state flag]] pledges of allegiance are required to be recited after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American &amp; State Pledges|work=Speck's Web|date=November 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2014|url=http://specksweb.com/pledge/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
=== Balch and Bellamy pledges ===
The Pledge of Allegiance, as it exists in its current form, was composed in August 1892 by [[Francis Bellamy]] (1855–1931), who was a [[Baptist]] minister, a [[Christian socialist]],&lt;ref name=Kubal&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubal|first=Timothy|title=Cultural Movements and Collective Memory: Christopher Columbus and the Rewriting of the National Origin Myth|date=October 2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire, GBR|isbn=978-0-230-61576-2|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9780230615762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/bellamy_f/bellamy_f.html |title=Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon profile of Bellamy |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cousin of socialist utopian novelist [[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898). There did exist a previous version created by Captain George T. Balch, a veteran of the Civil War, who later became auditor of the New York Board of Education. Balch's pledge, which existed contemporaneously with the Bellamy version until the 1923 National Flag Conference, read:

{{quote|We give our heads and hearts to God and our country; one country, one language, one flag!}}

Balch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants, loyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the subject and work with both the government and private organizations to distribute flags to every classroom and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Overland Monthly|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=prVUAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Samuel Carson|date = January 1, 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balch's pledge, which predates Bellamy's by 5 years and was embraced by many schools, by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] until the 1910s, and by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when discussing the history of the Pledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bellamy, however, did not approve of the pledge as Balch had written it, referring to the text as "too juvenile and lacking in dignity."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; The Bellamy "Pledge of Allegiance" was first published in the September 8 issue of the popular children's magazine ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' as part of the National Public-School Celebration of [[Columbus Day]], a celebration of the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by James B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea of [[American nationalism]] in students and to encourage children to raise flags above their schools.&lt;ref name="The Story"&gt;Bellamy, Francis, "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3418 The Story of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag]," ''University of Rochester Library Bulletin'', Vol. VIII, Winter 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Margarette S. Miller, this campaign was in line both with Upham's patriotic vision as well as with his commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham "would often say to his wife: 'Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for their country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them an ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into The Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Pledge Allegiance|author=Margarette S. Miller|publisher=Christopher Publishing House, Youth's companion|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellamy's original Pledge read:
{{quote|I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&lt;ref name=ushistory&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pledge of Allegiance|url=http://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm|work=Historic Documents|publisher=Independence Hall Association: ushistory.org|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bellamy]] – The word "to" was inserted between "my Flag and" and "the Republic" in October 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:PledgeOfAllegiance1899.jpg|thumb|Students reciting a pledge on [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] in 1899]]
The Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words ''equality'' and ''fraternity''&lt;ref name="The Story" /&gt; but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.&lt;ref name="Socialist Concepts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldtimeislands.org/pledge/pledge.htm |author=Dr. John W.

Francis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the [[National Education Association]] to support the ''Youth's Companion'' as a sponsor of the Columbus Day observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and [[Benjamin Harrison|President Benjamin Harrison]] to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus Day celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized to coincide with the opening of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (the Chicago World's Fair), [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Margarette S. (1976). ''Twenty Three Words: A Biography of Francis Bellamy: Author of the Pledge of Allegiance''. Portsmouth, Vir.: Printcraft Press. pp. 63–65 {{ISBN|0-686-15626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Bellamy's account===
In his recollection of the creation of the Pledge, Francis Bellamy said, "At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was an old story&amp;nbsp;... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools."&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite journal|title="A Brief Synopsis of the Story of the Origin of the Pledge taken from the Detailed Narrative by Francis Bellamy, Author of the Pledge"|author=Francis Bellamy |publisher= Congressional Record 91 Cong. Rec. (1945) House |pages=5510–5511}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Upham "felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,"&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; so his publication "fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892–93).&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;

As the World's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the publication's flag drive to the event, "so that every school in the land&amp;nbsp;... would have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying "not only the superintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with governors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; The publication's efforts paid off when [[Benjamin Harrison]] declared Wednesday October 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' made "an official program for universal use in all the schools."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy recalled that the event "had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;

Edna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event, and "There was also an oration suitable for declamation."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy held that "Of course, the nub of the program was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; He found "There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, "I give my heart and my hand to my country, one country, one language, one flag," seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, "It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word 'allegiance'. ...&amp;nbsp;Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that 'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first person singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to 'the.'"&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy considered the words "country, nation, or Republic," choosing the last as "it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded "all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;

Bellamy considered the slogan of the [[French Revolution]], ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]'' ("liberty, equality, fraternity"), but held that "fraternity was too remote of realization, and … [that] equality was a dubious word."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Concluding "Liberty and justice were surely basic, were undebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle. If they were exercised for all. They involved the spirit of equality and fraternity."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;

After being reviewed by Upham and other members of ''The Youth's Companion'', the Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy noted that "in later years the words 'to my flag' were changed to 'to the flag of the United States of America' because of the large number of foreign children in the schools."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Bellamy disliked the change, as "it did injure the rhythmic balance of the original composition."&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;

In 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution's magazine, ''The American Monthly'', listed the "formula of allegiance" as being the Balch Pledge of Allegiance, which reads:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QMgWAAAAYAAJ|publisher = National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.|date = January 1, 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands. I pledge my head and my heart to God and my country. One country, one language and one flag.}}

In subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such as in 1915's "Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution" and 1916's annual "National Report," the Balch Pledge, listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as "Old Pledge" with Bellamy's version under the heading "New Pledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Congressional Serial Set|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RGBUAAAAIAAJ|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|date = January 1, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Proceedings of the ... Continental Congress of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l2UUAAAAYAAJ|publisher = The Congress.|date = January 1, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "Old Pledge" continued to be used by other organizations until the National Flag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.

In 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words "my Flag" to be changed to "the Flag of the United States," so that new immigrants would not confuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words "of America" were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge for the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:&lt;ref name="PL_77-623"&gt;[[s:Public Law 77-623|Pub.L. 77-623, Chap. 435]], 56 Stat. 377, H.J.Res. 303, enacted June 22, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addition of "under God" ===
{{redirect|Under God|the book|Under God (book)}}
Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of "under God" to the pledge. The National Society of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pledge of Allegiance: A Revised History and Analysis, 1892–2007 |last=Baer |first=John W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Free State Press |location=Annapolis, MD |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion and the Law in America: An Encyclopedia of Personal Belief |last=Merriman |first=Scott A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_8VFygyaDYC&amp;q=under+god#v=snippet&amp;q=under%20god&amp;f=false |year=2007

At a meeting on February 12, 1948,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007" /&gt; he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words "under God" added. He said that the words came from Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]]. Although not all manuscript versions of the [[Gettysburg address#Usage of "under God"|Gettysburg Address contain the words "under God"]], all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said "that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom." Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007" /&gt;

In 1951, the [[Knights of Columbus]], the world's largest [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal service organization]], also began including the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;ref name="kocsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/communications/pledgeAllegiance.pdf |title= Knights of Columbus Fact Sheet|accessdate=June 16, 2011 |publisher= Knights of Columbus }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words "under God" after the words "one nation." Over the next two years, the idea spread throughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952, the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this resolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding Officer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The National Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a similar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]]. Several State Fraternal Congresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to several official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus policy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.&lt;ref name="kofc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/communications/pledgeAllegiance.pdf |title=How the words "UNDER GOD" came to be added to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag |publisher= |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of a correspondent, Representative [[Louis C. Rabaut]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Michigan|Mich.]]), of Michigan sponsored a resolution to add the words "under God" to the Pledge in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Broadway, Bill.

[[File:Georgeandike.jpg|thumb|[[George MacPherson Docherty]] (left) and President Eisenhower (second from left) on the morning of February 7, 1954, at the [[New York Avenue Presbyterian Church]].]]
Before February 1954, no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from [[George MacPherson Docherty]]. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, [[New York Avenue Presbyterian Church]] by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, [[George MacPherson Docherty]], delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled "A New Birth of Freedom." He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: "There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life." He cited Lincoln's words "under God" as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] had been baptized a [[Presbyterian]] very recently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a conversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the next day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. [[Charles Oakman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Michigan|Mich.]]), introduced a bill to that effect. [[83rd United States Congress|Congress]] passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]], June 14, 1954.&lt;ref name="PL_83-396" /&gt; Eisenhower said:

{{quote|From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.... In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/god-in-the-white-house/ |title=God In America: God in the White House |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase "under God" was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a [[Joint Resolution]] of Congress amending §&amp;nbsp;4 of the [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] enacted in 1942.&lt;ref name="PL_83-396"&gt;[[s:Public Law 83-396|Pub.L. 83-396, Chap. 297]], 68 Stat. 249, H.J.Res. 243, enacted June 14, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion adopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion Convention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus for having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;ref name="kofc.org" /&gt;

Even though the movement behind inserting "under God" into the pledge might have been initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, historian [[Kevin M. Kruse]] asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill in the minds of the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the push-back against Russian atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the [[New Deal]] played the larger role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/396365659/how-one-nation-didnt-become-under-god-until-the-50s-religious-revival |title=How 'One Nation' Didn't Become 'Under God' Until The '50s Religious Revival |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salute ==
[[Image:Students_pledging_allegiance_to_the_American_flag_with_the_Bellamy_salute.jpg|thumb|Children performing the Bellamy salute to the [[flag of the United States]], 1941.]]
Swearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a [[salute]]. An early version of the salute, adopted in 1887, known as the Balch Salute, which accompanied the Balch pledge, instructed students to stand with their right hand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to the forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally falling to the side.

In 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the [[Bellamy salute]]. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the [[Nazi salute]], which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leepson |first=Marc |title=Flag: An American Biography |publisher=Macmillan |year=2006 |page=171 |isbn=0-312-32309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1) of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/benefits/resources/rules-for-rendering-hand-salute-of-u.s.-flag |title=Rules for Rendering Hand Salute of U.S. Flag |publisher=Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
[[File:Pledge-of-Allegiance-to-the-Flag-by-Irving-Caesar.pdf|alt=Musical setting by Irving Caesar|thumb|Musical setting by Irving Caesar]]
A musical setting for "The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag" was created by Irving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House Resolution 243 to add the phrase "under God" was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=original+performance+pledge+of+allegiance+song+by+irving+caesar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NDHEcoQhfU&amp;sig=MnokM9UwyGEwK2JfnqyTWGwYYvI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6ueTakeTUAhWDPz4KHe_BDOg4ChDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=April 20, 1957|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer, Irving Caesar, wrote and published over 700 songs in his lifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical setting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without owing royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=original+performance+pledge+of+allegiance+song+by+irving+caesar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QQy72z266q&amp;sig=wnlHKVfb2vMYDL14pdfFJ4EiriQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9h9epjuTUAhVMbz4KHXgiDdQQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=September 19, 1960|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irvingcaesar.com/|title=Irving Caesar Welcome|website=www.irvingcaesar.com|access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on Flag Day, June 14, 1955 by the official Air Force choral group the "Singing Sergeants". A July 29, 1955 House and Senate resolution authorized the  U.S. Government Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together with a history of the pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-69/pdf/STATUTE-69-PgB24-4.pdf|title="Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag" H.

== Controversy ==
{{Main article|Criticism of the Pledge of Allegiance}}
In 1940, the [[Supreme Court (United States)|Supreme Court]], in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'', ruled that students in public schools, including the respondents in that case—[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] who considered the flag salute to be [[idolatry]]—could be compelled to swear the Pledge. In 1943, in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'', the Supreme Court reversed its decision. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the precise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are not required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such ideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country, concluding with:

{{quote|If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants =West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|vol=319 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=624 |pinpoint=642 |court=U.S. Supreme Court |date=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a later case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also not required to stand for the Pledge.&lt;ref name="SittingIsSpeech"&gt;{{cite court |litigants =Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland |vol=370 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1252 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=2004 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5852851742040988222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JapaneseAmericansChildrenPledgingAllegiance1942-2.jpg|thumb|First graders of Japanese ancestry pledging allegiance to the American flag (1942, photo by [[Dorothea Lange]]).]]
Requiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has continued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.

One objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of [[dissent]] should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Lane v. Owens''; 03-B-1544, United States District Court, District of Colorado&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SittingIsSpeech" /&gt; Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olander |first=Herbert T.|title=Children's Knowledge of the Flag Salute |journal=The Journal of Educational Research |date=December 1941 |volume=35| pages=300–305|issue=4|jstor=27528245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that a government requiring or promoting the phrase "under God" violates protections against the [[establishment of religion]] guaranteed in the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Katu1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.katu.com/news/national/87374952.html |agency=Associated Press |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=March 11, 2010 |title=Court upholds 'under God' in Pledge of Allegiance |authorlink=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316214405/http://www.katu.com/news/national/87374952.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were simply quoting Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]], but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, "under God" meant "God willing", so they would have found its use in the Pledge of Allegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.&lt;ref name="LLog1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001089.html |author=Geoffrey Nunberg |date=June 20, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |title=I Might Have Guessed Parson Weems Would Figure In There Somewhere | website=[[Language Log]] |authorlink=Geoffrey Nunberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llog2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001090.html |author=Geoffrey Nunberg |date=June 20, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |title="(Next) Under God," Phrasal Idiom | website=[[Language Log]] |authorlink=Geoffrey Nunberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal challenges ===
Prominent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to the flag.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses-Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, 1993, pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; They said requiring the pledge violated their [[freedom of religion]] guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. The first case was in 1935, when two children, [[Minersville School District v. Gobitis|Lillian and William Gobitas]], ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Flag+Salute+Cases|title=Flag Salute Cases |publisher=The Free Dictionary|date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586, 60 S. Ct. 1010, 84 L. Ed. 1375 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 case brought by atheist [[Michael Newdow]], whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled the phrase "under God" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the [[Supreme Court (United States)|Supreme Court]] heard ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow's claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California]] on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge [[Lawrence Karlton]] ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to "one Nation under God."&lt;ref name=Kraveats2005&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273 |title=Federal judge rules Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional |first=David |last= Kravets |date=September 16, 2005 |accessdate = March 31, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060111132924/http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273 |archivedate = January 11, 2006 |newspaper= [[The Chicago Defender]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, in the Florida case ''Frazier v. Alexandre'', a federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment (United States)|Fourteenth Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Frazier v.

In 2009, a [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], teacher berated and had school police remove a 13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom.

On November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to God does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants =Freedom from Religion Foundation v.

In September 2013, a case was brought before the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the [[Constitution of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/04/us/massachusetts-pledge-of-allegiance/index.html?hpt=hp_t3 |title='Under God' part of Pledge of Allegiance under review in Massachusetts |publisher=CNN.com |date=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Massachusetts' highest court ruled that the pledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words "under God" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Massachusetts court rules 'under God' in pledge does not discriminate against atheists|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/massachusetts-court-rules-under-god-in-pledge-does-not-discriminate-against-atheists/2014/05/09/62e93ca2-d7b8-11e3-aae8-c2d44bd79778_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = May 9, 2014|access-date = February 13, 2016|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, "Under [the association members'] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the members] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do not and cannot advance here."&lt;ref name=Spoto/&gt; Bauman said the student could skip the pledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge unless they have "conscientious scruples" that do not allow it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/hearing-under-god-in-pledge-of-allegiance-does-not-violate-rights-of-atheist-students-nj-judge-rules-1.1332137|title=Hearing 'Under God' in Pledge of Allegiance does not violate rights of atheist students, NJ judge rules|author=Salvador Rizzo|website=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=February 29, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310061721/http://www.northjersey.com/news/hearing-under-god-in-pledge-of-allegiance-does-not-violate-rights-of-atheist-students-nj-judge-rules-1.1332137|archivedate=March 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2015/02/07/judge-refuses-to-kick-god-out-of-public-schools/#11e06914435f|title=Judge Refuses To Kick God Out Of Public Schools|date=February 7, 2015|magazine=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted, "As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words '[[In God We Trust]]' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.”

{{IPA notice}}
'''Relaxed pronunciation''' (also called '''condensed pronunciation''' or '''word slurs''') is a phenomenon that happens when the [[syllable]]s of common words are slurred together. It is almost always present in normal speech, in all natural languages but not in some [[constructed language]]s, such as [[Loglan]] or [[Lojban]], which are designed so that all words are parsable.

Some shortened forms of words and phrases, such as [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] or [[weak and strong forms in English|weak forms]] can be considered to derive from relaxed pronunciations, but a phrase with a relaxed pronunciation is not the same as a contraction. In [[English language|English]], where contractions are common, they are considered part of the standard language and accordingly used in many contexts (except in very formal speech or in formal/legal writing); however, relaxed pronunciation is markedly informal in [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]. This is also sometimes reflected in writing: contractions have a standard written form, but relaxed pronunciations may not, outside of [[eye dialect]].

Certain relaxed pronunciations occur only in specific grammatical contexts, the exact understanding of which can be complicated. See [[trace (linguistics)]] for some further info.

==English==
The following sections contain common words said with relaxed pronunciation in [[American English]], along with pronunciations given in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], and a [[eye dialect|common written indication]] of this pronunciation where applicable:

===''Of'', ''have'', and ''to''===
The words ''of'', ''to'', and ''have'' all tend to elide to nothing more than a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} in many common situations.  This sometimes leads to spelling confusion, such as writing ''"I could{{sic|hide=y}} of..."'' instead of ''"I could have..."'' or ''"I could've"''.
*could have: {{IPA|[ˈkʊɾə]}}, ''coulda'' or  {{IPA|[ˈkʊɾəv]}}, ''could uhv''.
*must have: {{IPA|[ˈmʌstə]}}, ''musta'' or  {{IPA|[ˈmʌstəv]}}, ''must uhv''.
*should have: {{IPA|[ˈʃʊɾə]}}, ''shoulda'' or {{IPA|[ˈʃʊɾəv]}}, ''should uhv''.
*would have: {{IPA|[ˈwʊɾə]}}, ''woulda'' or {{IPA|[ˈwʊɾəv]}}, ''would uhv''.
*it would: when contracted, it's pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɪɾəd]}}, ''iduhd'', but this often collapses to {{IPA|[ˈɪd]}}, ''ihd''.
*it would / it would have: {{IPA|[ˈɪɾə]}}, ''itta''.
*a lot of: {{IPA|[əˈlɑɾə]}}, ''a lotta''.
*kind of: {{IPA|[ˈkaɪɾ̃ə]}}, ''kinda''.
*out of: {{IPA|[ˈaʊɾə]}}, ''outta''.
*sort of: {{IPA|[ˈsɔɹɾə]}}, ''sorta''.
*going to: {{IPA|[ˈɡʌnə]}}, ''gonna''.
*got to: {{IPA|[ˈɡɑɾə]}}, ''gotta''.
*have to: {{IPA|[ˈhæftə]}}, ''hafta''.
*want to: {{IPA|[ˈwɑɾ̃ə]}}, ''wanna''.
*ought to : {{IPA|[ˈɔɾə]}}, ''oughta''.
"Would" can also get contracted ("I'd have done things differently."), which usually yields {{IPA|[ɾə]}} ("I would have..." can be 
pronounced {{IPA|[aɪɾə]}}). &lt;br /&gt;
Note: The {{IPA|[v]}} in "have" and "of" is usually retained before a vowel sound (e.g. in "I could have ''asked''...").

===''You''===
''"You"'' tends to elide to {{IPA|[jə]}} (often written ''"ya"''). Softening of the preceding consonant also may occur: ({{IPA|/t/}} + {{IPA|/jə/}} = {{IPA|[tʃə]}}, {{IPA|/d/}} + {{IPA|/jə/}} = {{IPA|[dʒə]}}, {{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/jə/}} = {{IPA|[ʃə]}}, and {{IPA|/z/}} + {{IPA|/jə/}} = {{IPA|[ʒə]}}). This can also happen with other words that begin with {{IPA|[j]}} (e.g. "your", "yet", "year").  In some dialects, such as Australian English, this is not a relaxed pronunciation but compulsory: got you {{IPA|[ˈɡɔtʃjʉː]}} (never *{{IPA|[ˈɡɔtjʉː]}}){{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

*did you: {{IPA|[ˈdɪdʒə]}}, ''didja''
*do you: {{IPA|[ˈdʒə]}}, ''d'ya''
*don't you: {{IPA|[ˈdoʊntʃə]}}, ''doncha''
*got you: {{IPA|[ˈɡɒtʃə]}}, ''gotcha''
*get you / get your: {{IPA|[ˈɡɛtʃə]}}, ''getcha''
*would you: {{IPA|[ˈwʊdʒə]}}, ''wouldja''

===Other===
*-ing forms of verbs and sometimes gerunds tend to be pronounced with an {{IPA|[ɪ̈n]}} at the end instead of the expected {{IPA|[iŋ]}} or {{IPA|[ɪŋ]}}. E.g. talking: {{IPA|[ˈtʰɑkɪ̈n]}}, ''tahkin''. If followed by a {{IPA|[t]}}, this can in turn blend with it to form {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}}. E.g. talking to Bob: {{IPA|[ˈtʰɑkɪ̈ɾ̃̃ə ˈbɑb]}}, ''tahkinna Bob''
*"''I will''" gets contracted to "''I'll''" {{IPA|[aɪjəl]}}, which in turn gets reduced to "''all''" {{IPA|[ɑl]}} in relaxed pronunciation. E.g. I'll do it: {{IPA|[ˈɑl ˈduɪʔ(t)]}}, ''all do it''
*"''he''" tends to elide to just {{IPA|[i]}} after consonants, sometimes after vowel sounds as well. E.g. is he: {{IPA|[ˈɪzi]}}, ''izee''; all he: {{IPA|[ˈɑli]}}, ''ahlee''
*"''his''", "''him''", and "''her''" tend to elide in most environments to {{IPA|[ɪ̈z]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ̈m]}}, and {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, respectively. E.g. meet his: {{IPA|[ˈmiɾɪ̈z]}}, ''meetiz''; tell him: {{IPA|[ˈtʰɛlɪ̈m]}}, ''tellim''; show her {{IPA|[ˈʃoʊɚ]}}, ''show-er''
*"''them''" tends to elide to {{IPA|[əm]}} after consonants. E.g. ask them: {{IPA|[ˈæskəm]}}, ''ask'em''. (Historically, this is a remnant of the Middle English pronoun ''hem''.) 
*about: {{IPA|[ˈbaʊt]}}, ''bout''
*already: {{IPA|[ɑˈɹɛɾi]}}, ''ahready''
*all right: {{IPA|[ɑˈɹʌit]}}, ''ahright''
*all right: {{IPA|[ɑˈʌit]}}, ''aight''
*come here: {{IPA|[ˈkʌmi(ə)ɹ]}}, ''cuhmeer''
*don't know: {{IPA|[ɾəˈnoʊ]}}, {{IPA|[dəˈnoʊ]}} if not preceded by a vowel sound, ''dunno''
*fixing to: "finna"
*give me: {{IPA|[ˈɡɪmi]}}, ''gimme''
*I'm going to: {{IPA|[ˈaɪmə]}}, "I'mma" or {{IPA|[ˈɑmənə]}}, "Ah-muhnuh"
*is it: {{IPA|[zɪt]}}, ''’zit''
*isn't it: {{IPA|[ˈɪnɪt]}}, ''innit''
*let me: {{IPA|[ˈlɛmi]}}, ''lemme''
*let's: {{IPA|[ts]}}, E.g. let's go: {{IPA|[tsˈɡoʊ]}}
*library: {{IPA|[ˈlaɪbɹi]}}, {{IPA|[ˈlaɪˌbɛɹi]}}
*probably: {{IPA|[ˈpɹɑli]}}, {{IPA|[ˈpɹɑbli]}}, ''prolly'', ''probly''
*suppose: {{IPA|[spoʊz]}} ''s'pose''. E.g. I suppose so: {{IPA|[ai spoʊz soʊ]}}
*trying to: {{IPA|[ˈtɹaɪɾ̃ə]}} "trynna" 
*want a / want to: {{IPA|[ˈwɑɾ̃ə]}}, ''wanna''
*what is that: {{IPA|[ˌwʌˈsæt]}}, ''wussat''
*what is up: {{IPA|[wəˈsʌp]}}, ''wassup''
*what is up: {{IPA|[sʌp]}}, ''’sup''
*what are you: {{IPA|[ˈwʌtʃə]}}, ''whatcha''
*what have you: {{IPA|[ˈwʌtʃə]}}, ''whatcha''. E.g. What have you been up to? : {{IPA|[wʌtʃə bɪn ʌp tu]}}
*what do you/what are you: {{IPA|[ˈwʌɾəjə]}}, ''whaddaya''
*you all: {{IPA|[jɑl]}}, ''y’all''

==Dutch==
*''weenie'' = ''Ik weet het niet'' ("I don't know")
*''lama'' = ''Laat maar (zitten)'' ("Nevermind")

Examples of the Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands include:
*''der'' = ''de hare'' ("hers")
*''ie'' = ''hij'' ("he"), often used in phrases such as ''dattie'' for ''dat hij'' ("that he")
*''amme'' = ''aan mijn'' ("on / to my"), for example in ''ammezolen'' for ''aan mijn zolen'' ("not on your life")

Often, especially in [[Belgian Dutch]], the -t at the end of the word is omitted.
*''nie'' = ''niet''
*''da'' = ''dat''  For example, ''kweet da nie'' = ''Ik weet dat niet'' ("I don't know that")
*''wasda'' = ''wat is dat'' ("What is that")

==German==

*''Ich'' ("I") → ''ch/(sch)'' ''Ich weiß'' ("I know") → ''Schweiß'' (would translate, literally, to "sweat". A common source of some well-known jokes)
*''Du'' ("you", singular) → ''de/d'' - ''Weißt du'' ("do you know") → ''Weißte''
*''Wir'' ("we") → ''mer'' - ''Können wir ...'' ("can we") =&gt; ''Kö(n)mmer ...'', ''Kennen wir!'' ("we know") → ''Ke(n)mmer!''
*''Das'' ("this/the") → ''(d)s'' - ''Das Pferd dort'' ("The horse over there") → '''s Pferd dort''
*''es'' ("it") → ''s'' - ''Es regnet'' ("It's raining") → '''s regnet''
*''Ist'' ("is") → ''is/s'' - ''ist es möglich'' ("is it possible") → ''isses möglich''
*''denn'' ("then, actually, anyway") → ''(d)n'' - ''Was ist denn los?'' ("What's up") → ''Was'n los?''
*''so ein(e)'' ("such a") → ''so'n(e)'', ''von so einem'' ("of such a") → ''von so'm''
*''vielleicht'' ("maybe") → ''v'leisch'' (same pronunciation as ''Fleisch'', "meat", also a source of jokes)

A wide range of possible pronunciations can be found in the negatory 'nicht'' ("not") depending on the dialect region.
*''Nicht'' ("not") → ''nich (mostly in [[Northern Germany]])/nit ([[Cologne]] region)/net (southern [[Hessian dialects|hessian]])/et ([[swabian German|swabian]])/ni ([[saxonian]])'' - ''Können wir nicht einfach...'' ("Can't we simply ...") → ''Kömmer nich einfach...''

==Russian==
The most notable example in [[Russian language]] is the [[greeting]] здравствуйте ({{IPA-ru|ˈzdrastvujtʲɪ|}}), which is colloquially pronounced {{IPA|[ˈzdrastʲɪ]}}.  Other examples include:
*сейчас {{IPA|[sʲɪjˈtɕas]}} → щас {{IPA|[ɕːas]}} or ща {{IPA|[ɕːa]}} ('now')
*сегодня {{IPA|[sʲɪˈvodʲnʲə]}} → сёдня {{IPA|[ˈsʲɵdʲnʲə]}} ('today')
*что {{IPA|[ʂto]}} → чё {{IPA|[tɕɵ]}} ('what'; originally a contraction of [[Genitive case|Genitive]] чего {{IPA|[tɕiˈvo]}}, but can be used instead of [[Nominative case|Nominative]] too)
*когда {{IPA|[kɐˈɡda]}} → када {{IPA|[kɐˈda]}} ('when')
*тысяча {{IPA|[ˈtɨsʲɪtɕa]}} → тыща {{IPA|[ˈtɨɕːa]}} ('thousand')
*шестьдесят {{IPA|[ʂɨzʲdʲɪˈsʲat]}} → шисят {{IPA|[ʂɨˈsʲat]}} ('sixty')

Contracted forms are usually found only in colloquial contexts, but they can occur in poetry.

For example, look at the verse from the Russian translation of [[Avesta]] (Mihr Yasht, verse 129):
:На колеснице Митры,
:Чьи пастбища просторны,
: Стрел '''тыща''' златоустых
"''On a side of the chariot of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, stand a '''thousand''' ... arrows, with a golden mouth."

This contrasts with contracted forms found in colloquial speech in that it is used to keep the original rhythm. The previous verse (verse 128) has a literary form:
:На колеснице Митры,
:Чьи пастбища Просторны,
:Из жил оленьих '''тысяча'''
:Отборных тетивы''

"''On a side of the chariot of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, stand a '''thousand''' bows well-made, with a string of cowgut''".

==French==
Among other relaxed pronunciations, ''tu as'' (you have) is frequently elided to ''t'as'' in colloquial [[French language|French]] or ''tu es'' (you are) to ''t'es''.
The same with ''je suis'' (I am) to ''j'suis'' or ''ch'uis'' (very informal, or regional), and ''je (ne) sais pas'' (I don't know) to ''j'sais pas'' or ''ch'ais pas'' (very informal, or regional).
Moreover, most of the negative forms ''ne'' or ''n''' are lost in non-formal discussion.
The expression, "Qu'est-ce que..." is little used in colloquial speech for forming the interrogative, but when it is, in very informal use, it is shortened:

"Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?" becomes...
"Qu'est-c'tu veux ?"

"Qu'est-ce que tu as dit?"  becomes...
"Qu'est-c't'as dit?"

A more complex sentence, such as "il ne savait peut-être plus ce qu'il faisait" ("Perhaps he knew no more what he was doing"), can become "i n'savait p'têt plus c'qui v'zait" [in savεp tεt plys kiv zε], or even further relaxed, "i sa'ait têt' pu c'qui v'zait" [i saεp tεt pys kiv zε].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editionsdutroubadour.com/symptyxe.html   ''Die Symptyx im spontanen französischen Redefluss ''], Les Editions du Troubadour, accessed December 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish==

Forms of the verb ''estar'' ("to be") are often shortened by dropping the first syllable (as if the verb were ''*tar''){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.
*''Estoy aquí'' → ''Toy aquí.''
*''Acá está.'' → ''Acá ta.'' ("Here it is", joking tone or baby-talk)
*''Para'' → ''Pa'.''

Often, ''d'' will turn into its [[Spanish phonology#Consonants|approximant]], the [[Voiced dental fricative]], which is "softer"; and when placed between two vowels it might disappear in relaxed pronunciation{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

As such, the ''d'' in the final ''-ado'' of past participles can disappear: ''Estoy cansado'' ("I am tired") is heard as ''Toy cansao''; this is also applied to the final ''-ido'', as in *''Me perdío'' ("I got lost").
This phenomenon is often perceived as uncultured, and can lead to [[hypercorrection]]s like *''bacalado'' instead of ''bacalao'' ("[[cod]]"){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

[[Hiatus (linguistics)|Hiatus]] between two words will often lead to these merging{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, with ''del'' being the grammatically correct form of ''de el''.  If the merged word is small enough, it might be omitted entirely{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}:
*''Me he perdido'' → ''Me perdío''

Some dialects like [[Andalusian Spanish]] lose the syllable-final ''s''.
Since it is important as a mark of plurals, it is substituted with vowel opening{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

==Portuguese==
Examples:

: ''tá'' = ''está'' ([it/she/he] is)
: ''tamém'' = ''também'' (also)
: ''ma'' = ''uma'' (a/one)
: '''vambora'' = ''vamos embora'' (let's go)
: '''bora'' = ''vamos embora'' (let's go)
: ''pra'', ''pa'' = ''para'' (to)
: ''cê'' = ''você'' (you)
: ''home'' = ''homem'' (man)
: ''vô'' = ''vou'' (I will) (In Portugal 'ô' is the standard pronunciation of 'ou')
: ''portuga, tuga'' = ''português'' (both for the [[Portuguese people]] and [[Portuguese language|language]])
: ''para'' + ''o'' = ''pro'' -further contraction-&gt; ''po''.
: ''para'' + ''a'' = ''pra'' -&gt; ''pa''.
: ''para'' + ''os'' = ''pros'' -&gt; ''pos''.
: ''para'' + ''as'' = ''pras'' -&gt; ''pas''.
: ''num'' = ''não'' (no/don't. It is just used in the beginning or middle of a sentence).
: ''né?'' = ''não é?'' (it is equivalente to the [[tag question]]s).
: ''d'uma'' = ''de uma'' (of a).

In some dialects, ''que'' (that) is reduced to the "q" sound:
: ''que'' + ''a'' = ''q'a''
: ''que'' + ''o'' = ''q'o''
: ''que'' + ''ela'' = ''q'ela'' (that she)
: ''que'' + ''ele'' = ''q'ele'' (that he)
: ''que'' + ''é'' = ''q'é'' (that is)
: ''que'' + ''foi'' = ''q'foi'' (that was), etc...

In Portugal, the mute 'e' and the final unstressed vowels are often elided:
: ''perigo'' = ''prigo'' (danger)
: ''mete água'' = ''met água'' (put water) 
: ''muito mais'' = ''muit mais'' (much more)
: ''fala inglês'' = ''fal inglês'' (speaks english) (if the following word starts with a consonant, the final 'a' cannot be elided)

==Japanese==
Japanese can undergo some vowel deletion or consonant mutation in relaxed speech. While these are common occurrences in the formation of some regular words, typically after the syllables ''ku'' or ''tsu'', as in 学校 ''gakkō'' (学 ''gaku'' + 校 ''kō'') "school" or 出発 ''shuppatsu'' (出 ''shutsu'' + 発 ''hatsu'') "departure", in rapid speech, these changes can appear in words that did not have them before, such as ''suizokkan'' for ''suizokukan'' 水族館 "aquarium."
Additionally, the syllables ''ra'', ''ri'', ''ru'', ''re'' and ''ro'' sometimes become simply ''n'' or when they occur before another syllable beginning with ''n'' or ''d'', and disappear entirely before syllabic ''n''. This can happen within a word or between words, such as 分かんない ''wakannai'' "I dunno" for 分からない ''wakaranai'' "I don't know" or もう来てんだよ ''mō kite n da yo'' "they're already here" for もう来ているんだよ ''mō kite iru n da yo''.

Relaxed pronunciation also makes use of several [[contraction (grammar)#Japanese|contractions]].

==Turkish==
Examples:

*''Ne haber?'' (What's up?)→ ''N'aber?''
*''Ne oluyor?'' (What's going on?) → ''N'oluyor?''
*''Ne yapıyorsun?'' (What are you doing?) → ''N'apıyorsun?''
** This can further be reduced → ''N'apıyon''

In all of these cases, the pronounced length of the initial [[vowel]] is slightly extended, though in the case of "napıyon" the terminal vowel maintains its initial length or, if anything, is shortened.

==Urdu==
In [[Urdu]], it is common to [[Elision|elide]] the sound /h/ ˂ہ˃ in normal speech. For example, آپ کہاں جا رہے ہیں ''āp kahāṅ jā rahay haiṅ'' will be pronounced آپ کاں جا رے ایں ''āp kān ja rai aiṅ''.

'''Roman glass''' objects have been recovered across the [[Roman empire|Roman Empire]] in domestic, industrial and [[funerary]] contexts. [[Glass]] was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured cast glass vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of [[Glassblowing|glass blowing]] and the dominance of colourless or 'aqua' glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S. J., 1999. ''Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change''. Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stern99"&gt;Stern, E. M., 1999. Roman Glassblowing in a Cultural Context. ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 103/3, 441-484.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.

==Growth of the Roman glass industry==
[[File:Verre gallo-romain 02.jpg|thumb|right|Roman glass from the 2nd century]]

Despite the growth of [[History of glass|glass working in the Hellenistic World]] and the growing place of glass in [[Archaeological culture|material culture]], at the beginning of the 1st century AD there was still no Latin word for it in the Roman World.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; However, glass was being produced in Roman contexts using primarily [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] techniques and styles (see [[History of glass|glass, history]]) by the late [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period. The majority of manufacturing techniques were time-consuming, and the initial product was a thick-walled vessel which required considerable finishing. This, combined with the cost of importing [[natron]] for the production of raw glass, contributed to the limited use of glass and its position as an expensive and high-status material.

The glass industry was therefore a relatively minor craft during the Republican period; although, during the early decades of the 1st century AD the quantity and diversity of glass vessels available increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; This was a direct result of the massive growth of the Roman influence at the end of the Republican period, the [[Pax romana|Pax Romana]] that followed the decades of civil war,&lt;ref name="Dussart"&gt;Dussart, O., B. Velde, et al., 2004. Glass from Qal'at Sem'an (Northern Syria): The reworking of glass during the transition from Roman to Islamic compositions. ''Journal of Glass Studies'' 46, 67-83.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stabilisation of the state that occurred under [[Augustus]]' rule.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; Still, Roman glasswares were already making their way from [[Western Asia]] (i.e. the [[Parthian Empire]]) to the [[Kushan Empire]] in Afghanistan and India and as far [[Han Dynasty|Han Empire]] of [[China]]. The [[Sino-Roman relations|first Roman glass found in China]] came from [[Economy of the Han Dynasty|an early 1st-century BC tomb]] at [[Guangzhou]], ostensibly via the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;An, Jiayao. (2002).  "When Glass Was Treasured in China," in ''Silk Road Studies VII: Nomads, Traders, and Holy Men Along China's Silk Road'', 79–94. Edited by Annette L. Juliano and Judith A. Lerner. Turnhout: Brepols Publishers. {{ISBN|2-503-52178-9}}. Page 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia. (1999). ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-66991-X}}. Page 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this a major new technique in glass production had been introduced during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Allen98"&gt;Allen, D., 1998. ''Roman Glass in Britain''. Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, Shire Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glassblowing]] allowed glass workers to produce vessels with considerably thinner walls, decreasing the amount of glass needed for each vessel. Glass blowing was also considerably quicker than other techniques, and vessels required considerably less finishing, representing a further saving in time, raw material and equipment. Although earlier techniques dominated during the early Augustan and [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] periods,&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;Grose, D. F., 1991. Early Imperial Roman cast glass: The translucent coloured and colourless fine wares. ''Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention''. M. Newby and K. Painter. London: Society of Antiquaries of London.&lt;/ref&gt; by the middle to late 1st century AD earlier techniques had been largely abandoned in favour of blowing.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

As a result of these factors, the cost of production was reduced and glass became available for a wider section of society in a growing variety of forms. By the mid-1st century AD this meant that glass vessels had moved from a valuable, high-status commodity, to a material commonly available: "a [glass] drinking cup could be bought for a copper coin" (Strabo, [[Geographica]] XVI.2). This growth also saw the production of the first glass [[tesserae]] for mosaics, and the first window glass,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; as furnace technology improved allowing molten glass to be produced for the first time.&lt;ref name="Stern95"&gt;Stern, E. M., 1995. ''Roman Mould-blown Glass''. Rome, Italy, L'Erma di Fretshneidur in association with the Toledo Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the expansion of the empire also brought an influx of people and an expansion of cultural influences that resulted in the adoption of eastern decorative styles.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The changes that took place in the Roman glass industry during this period can therefore be seen as a result of three primary influences: historical events, technical innovation and contemporary fashions.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; They are also linked to the fashions and technologies developed in the ceramic trade, from which a number of forms and techniques were drawn.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

Glass making reached its peak at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The use of coloured glass as a decorative addition to pale and colourless glasses also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to [[Constantinople]] rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the [[Roman legion|Roman military]] in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

==Production==

===Composition===
{{Main|Glass}}
[[Image:Third beach sand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close-up of beach sand, the main component of Roman glass]]
Roman glass production relied on the application of heat to fuse two primary ingredients: silica and soda.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Technical studies of archaeological glasses divide the ingredients of glass as formers, fluxes, stabilisers, as well as possible opacifiers or colourants.
*'''Former:''' The major component of the glass is silica, which during the Roman period was [[sand]] (quartz), which contains some [[alumina]] (typically 2.5%) and nearly 8% [[lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref name="Dussart" /&gt; Alumina contents vary, peaking around 3% in glasses from the [[Western Roman Empire|western Empire]], and remaining notably lower in glasses from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Dussart" /&gt;
*'''Flux:''' This ingredient was used to lower the [[melting point]] of the silica to form glass. Analysis of Roman glass has shown that soda ([[sodium carbonate]]) was used exclusively in glass production.&lt;ref name ="Stern90"&gt;Stern, W. B., 1990. The composition of Roman glass. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the primary source of soda was [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt found in dry lake beds. The main source of natron during the Roman period was [[Wadi El Natrun]], Egypt, although there may have been a source in Italy.
*'''Stabiliser:''' Glasses formed of silica and soda are naturally soluble, and require the addition of a stabiliser such as lime or magnesia. Lime was the primary stabiliser in use during the Roman period, entering the glass through [[calcareous]] particles in the beach sand, rather than as a separate component.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt;

Roman glass has also been shown to contain around 1% to 2% chlorine, in contrast to later glasses.&lt;ref name ="Stern90" /&gt; This is thought to have originated either in the addition of salt (NaCl) to reduce the melting temperature and viscosity of the glass, or as a contaminant in the natron.

===Glass making===
[[File:Urna cineraria romana de vidrio (M.A.N. Inv.1990-69-150) 01.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Roman blown-glass [[cinerary urn]], dated between 1st and 3rd centuries AD]]

Archaeological evidence for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine glass|Byzantine]] periods, it is clear that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from [[Bet She'arim#Glassmaking industry|Bet She'arim]] illustrates.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around a relatively small number of workshops,&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks.&lt;ref name="Freestone2002"&gt;Freestone, I. C., M. Ponting, Hughes, M.J.,2002. Origins of Byzantine glass from Maroni Petrera, Cyprus. ''Archaeometry'' 44, 257-272.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only limited evidence for local glass making, and only in context of window glass.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but [[Pliny's Natural History]] (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD,&lt;ref name="Stern95" /&gt; indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.

The siting of glass-making workshops was governed by three primary factors: the availability of fuel which was needed in large quantities, sources of sand which represented the major constituent of the glass, and natron to act as a flux. Roman glass relied on natron from Wadi El Natrun, and as a result it is thought that glass-making workshops during the Roman period may have been confined to near-coastal regions of the eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; This facilitated the trade in the raw colourless or naturally coloured glass which they produced, which reached glass-working sites across the Roman empire.&lt;ref name="Freestone06" /&gt;

The scarcity of archaeological evidence for Roman glass-making facilities has resulted in the use of chemical compositions as evidence for production models,&lt;ref name="Baxter06" /&gt; as the division of production indicates that any variation is related to differences in raw glass making.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; However, the Roman reliance on natron from Wadi El Natrun as a flux,&lt;ref name ="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, C. M., H. E. M. Cool, Wager, E.C.W., 1998. The manufacture of glass in Roman York. ''Journal of Glass Studies'' 40, 55-61.&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in a largely homogenous composition in the majority of Roman glasses.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velde"&gt;Velde, B., Year. Observations on the chemical compositions of several types of Gallo-Roman and Frankish glass production.

H., 1999. ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''.

''Glass Making in the Greco-Roman World, Results of the ARCHGLASS Project'', Leuven University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and although there is some variation in Roman glass compositions, meaningful compositional groups have been difficult to establish for this period.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"&gt;Freestone, I. C., 2006. Glass production in [[Late Antiquity]] and the Early Islamic period: a geochemical perspective. ''Geomaterials in Cultural Heritage'', Geological Society of London.

===Recycling===
[[File:Satyr Bacchus Petit Palais ADUT00240.jpg|thumb|[[Cameo glass]] plaque with the infant [[Bacchus]] and a [[satyr]], early 1st century AD.]]
The Roman writers [[Statius]] and [[Martial]] both indicate that recycling broken glass was an important part of the glass industry, and this seems to be supported by the fact that only rarely are glass fragments of any size recovered from domestic sites of this period.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; In the western empire there is evidence that recycling of broken glass was frequent and extensive(cullet),&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; and that quantities of broken glassware were concentrated at local sites prior to melting back into raw glass.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Compositionally, repeated recycling is visible via elevated levels of those metals used as colourants.&lt;ref name="Freestone05"&gt;Freestone, I. C., 2005. The provenance of ancient glass through compositional analysis. ''Materials Issues in Art and Archaeology 7''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting does not appear to have taken place in crucibles; rather, cooking pots appear to have been used for small scale operations. For larger work, large tanks or tank-like ceramic containers were utilised. In the largest cases, large furnaces were built to surround these tanks.

===Glass working===
In comparison to glass making, there is evidence for glass working in many locations across the empire. Unlike the making process, the working of glass required significantly lower temperatures and substantially less fuel. As a result of this and the expansion of the Empire, glass working sites developed in Rome, Campania and the Po Valley&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; by the end of the 1st century BC, producing the new blown vessels alongside cast vessels. Italy is known to have been a centre for the working and export of brightly coloured vessels at this time,&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;[[Jennifer Price|Price, J.]], 1990. A survey of the Hellenistic and early Roman vessel glass found on the Unexplored Mansion Site at Knossos in Crete. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; with production peaking during the mid-1st century AD.&lt;ref name ="Allen98" /&gt;

By the early-to-mid-1st century AD, the growth of the Empire saw the establishment of glass working sites at locations along trade routes, with Cologne and other Rhineland centres becoming important glass working sites from the Imperial period,&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; and Syrian glass being exported as far as Italy.&lt;ref name="Facchini"/&gt; During this period vessel forms varied between workshops, with areas such as the Rhineland and northern France producing distinctive forms which are not seen further south.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Growth in the industry continued into the 3rd century AD, when sites at the Colonia Claudia Agrippinensis appear to have experienced significant expansion,&lt;ref name="Caldera"&gt;Caldera de Castro, M. d. P., 1990. Roman glass in southwest Spain. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 3rd and early 4th centuries producers north of the Alps were exporting down to the north of Italy and the transalpine regions.&lt;ref name="Facchini"&gt;Facchini, G. M., 1990. Roman glass in an excavational context: Angere (VA). Annales du 11e Congres. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass working sites such as those at Aquileia also had an important role in the spread of glassworking traditions&lt;ref name="Caldera" /&gt; and the trade in materials that used hollow glasswares as containers.&lt;ref name="Facchini" /&gt; However, by the 4th&lt;ref name="Caldera" /&gt; and 5th centuries&lt;ref name ="Facchini"/&gt; Italian glass workshops predominate.

===Styles===
[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Glass vessel from the 2nd century AD, found in [[Bosanski Novi]]]]

The earliest Roman glass follows Hellenistic traditions and uses strongly coloured and 'mosaic' patterned glass. During the late Republican period new highly coloured striped wares with a fusion of dozens of monochrome and lace-work strips were introduced.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; During this period there is some evidence that styles of glass varied geographically, with the translucent coloured fine wares of the early 1st century notably 'western' in origin, whilst the later colourless fine wares are more 'international'.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt; These objects also represent the first with a distinctly Roman style unrelated to the Hellenistic casting traditions on which they are based, and are characterised by novel rich colours.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; 'Emerald' green, dark or [[cobalt blue]], a deep blue-green and Persian or 'peacock' blue are most commonly associated with this period, and other colours are very rare.&lt;ref name ="Grose"/&gt; Of these, Emerald green and peacock blue were new colours introduced by the Romano-Italian industry and almost exclusively associated with the production of fine wares.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt;

However, during the last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, replaced by 'aqua' and true colourless glasses.&lt;ref name ="Allen98" /&gt; Colourless and 'aqua' glasses had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the blown glass market at this time.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; The use of strong colours in cast glass died out during this period, with colourless or 'aqua' glasses dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt;

From around 70 AD colourless glass becomes the predominant material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt; Debate continues whether this change in fashion indicates a change in attitude that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal,&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; or whether the shift to colourless glass indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; [[Pliny's Natural History]] states that "the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, as closely as possible resembling rock crystal" (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a production technique, which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

==Vessel production techniques==
[[Image:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Portland Vase]], 5-25AD(?) [[cameo glass]].]]

===Core and rod formed vessels===
Artisans used a mass of mud and straw fixed around a metal rod to form a core, and built up a vessel by either dipping the core in liquified glass, or by trailing liquid glass over the core.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; The core was removed after the glass had cooled, and handles, rims and bases were then added. These vessels are characterised by relatively thick walls, bright colours and zigzagging patterns of contrasting colours, and were limited in size to small [[unguent]] or scent containers.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; This early technique continued in popularity during the 1st century BC,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; despite the earlier introduction of [[slumping|slumped]] and [[glass casting|cast]] vessels.

===Cold-cut vessels===
This technique is related to the origin of glass as a substitute for [[gemstone]]s. By borrowing techniques for stone and [[engraved gems|carved gems]], artisans were able to produce a variety of small containers from blocks of raw glass or thick moulded [[Glass blank|blanks]],&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; including [[cameo glass]] in two or more colours, and [[cage cup]]s (still thought by most scholars to have been decorated by cutting, despite some debate).

===Glass blowing: free and mould blown vessels===
These techniques, which were to dominate the Roman glass working industry after the late 1st century AD, are discussed in detail on the [[glass blowing]] page. Mould-blown glass appears in the second quarter of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

===Other production techniques===
A number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period:

*[[Cage cup|Cage cup production]]
*[[Cameo glass|Cameo glass production]]
*[[Slumping]]
*[[Glass casting|Casting]]

==Decorative techniques==

===''Cast glass'' patterns===
[[File:Ribbed mosaic glass bowl MET DP141529 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ribbed bowl of mosaic glass in the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]

The glass sheets used for slumping could be produced of plain or multicoloured glass, or even formed of 'mosaic' pieces. The production of these objects later developed into the modern [[caneworking]] and [[millefiori]] techniques, but is noticeably different. Six primary patterns of 'mosaic' glass have been identified:&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;

*'''Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns:''' This was produced by binding rods of coloured glass together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then wound round a glass rod whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be fused together to form a plate or fused to plain glass.
*'''Marbled and dappled patterns:''' Some of these patterns are clearly formed through the distortion of the original pattern during the [[slumping]] of the glass plate during melting.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; However, by using spiral and circular patterns of alternating colours producers were also able to deliberately imitate the appearance of natural stones such as [[sardonyx]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; This occurs most often on pillar-moulded bowls, which are one of the commonest glass finds on 1st century sites.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;
*'''Lace patterns:''' Strips of coloured glass were twisted with a contrasting coloured thread of glass before being fused together. This was a popular method in the early period, but appears to have gone out of fashion by the mid-1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;
*'''Striped patterns:''' Lengths of monochrome and lacework glass were fused together to create vivid striped designs, a technique that developed from the lace pattern technique during the last decades of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;
The production of multicoloured vessels declined after the mid-1st century, but remained in use for some time after.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;

{{further|List of gold-glass portraits}}
[[Gold sandwich glass]] or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish; their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.  In contrast, a much smaller group of 3rd century portrait levels are superbly executed, with pigment painted on top of the gold.  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', pp. 25-26, Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0140560335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other decorative techniques===

A number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period, including [[Vitreous enamel#History|enamelling]] and [[Engraving#History and usage|engraving]].

==Tesserase and window glass==

Shards of broken glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the beginning of the 1st century small glass tiles, known as [[tesserae]], were being produced specifically for use in mosaics.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; These were usually in shades of yellow, blue or green, and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.

Around the same time the first window panes are thought to have been produced.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The earliest panes were [[rough cast]] into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Forbes, R. J., 1966. ''Studies in ancient technology V''. Editors: Leiden, Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical identification===
Shuafat has been suggested as  being the location of several Biblical places. 19th-century researchers have suggested [[Mizpah in Benjamin]],&lt;ref name=Conder3&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/13/mode/1up 13]-14&lt;/ref&gt; (Conder and Kitchener, 1883) and [[Nob, Israel|Nob]].&lt;ref&gt;Geikie, 1887, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/holylandbibleboo02geikuoft#page/158/mode/1up 158]–159.&lt;/ref&gt; (Geikie, 1887) A newer identification names [[Gebim]], but cautions that it's uncertain.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans&gt;{{cite book |title= Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |page= 487 |year= 2000 |publisher= Wm.

[[Tell el-Ful]], a site often identified as Gibeah, is located on the neighbourhood's outskirts.

===Second Temple period===

Following a 1991 [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig  conducted by Alexander Onn and Tzvi Greenhut which unearthed a 2nd century BCE fortified agricultural settlement near Shuafat, an underground  room in the complex was dated  to the early first century BCE, and identified as a prayer room or synagogue. Subsequently, this interpretation of the site was strongly questioned.&lt;ref name="Reisner"&gt; Rainer Reisner, 'Synagogues in Jerusalem,' in [[Richard Bauckham]]  [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLLuw0QZJ5kC&amp;pg=PA192  ''The Book of Acts in its First Century  Setting,'']  Wm.

During an archaeological [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] conducted near the Shuafat refugee camp in preparation for the laying of the tracks for the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] system, the remains of a Jewish settlement from the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]] were discovered.&lt;ref name="Sklar2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sklar-Parnes |first= Deborah A. |title= Jerusalem, Shu'fat: Ramallah Road |journal= Hadashot Arkheologiyot – Excavations and Surveys in Israel (HA-ESI) |date= 8 May 2005 |volume= 117 |publisher= Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) |location= Jerusalem |url= http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/Report_Detail_Eng.aspx?id=179&amp;mag_id=110 |access-date= 28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was on the main Roman road leading northward from Jerusalem towards [[Shechem]]/[[Nablus|Flavia Neapolis]].&lt;ref name ="JPost2006"/&gt; It was inhabited between the two main revolts of the Jews against the Romans, as it was established after the destruction of Jerusalem in [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|70 CE]] and was suddenly abandoned around 130 CE, short before the outbreak of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132-36).&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Yonatan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt; It is described as a 'sophisticated community impeccably planned by the Roman authorities, with orderly rows of houses and two fine public [[Thermae|bathhouses]] to the north.'&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt; At the time of its discovery it was said to be the first indication of an active Jewish settlement in the area of Jerusalem after the city fell in 70 CE,&lt;ref name="Barkat"/&gt; and with a presumed total surface area of c. 11 [[dunam]]s (minimum length 310 m, width c. 35 m),&lt;ref name="Sklar2005"/&gt; it was also considered the largest Jewish settlement of the time "in the vicinity of Jerusalem".&lt;ref name="MFA2007"&gt;{{cite news |author= Israel Antiquities Authority |title= Remains of Jewish settlement revealed in the Shu'afat neighborhood of Jerusalem |newspaper= Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website |date=10 April 2007 |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/remains%20of%20jewish%20settlement%20shuafat%20neighborhood%20jerusalem%2010-apr-2007.aspx |access-date=28 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main indication that the settlement was a Jewish one is the large and varied assemblage of chalkstone vessels found there.&lt;ref name="Barkat"&gt;{{cite web |title= Shuafat dig reveals first sign of Jewish life after destruction of Second Temple |author= Amiram Barkat |url= https://www.haaretz.com/1.5302430 |date= 2006-01-02  |access-date=2018-07-28}}, [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such vessels, for food storage and serving, were only used by Jews because they were believed not to transmit impurity.&lt;ref name="Barkat"/&gt; Some of the vessels discovered there belong to a type only found after 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Yonatan&lt;/ref&gt; An even more conclusive archaeological evidence of the Jewish character of a settlement is the presence of [[mikveh|Jewish ritual baths]], several of which were found during later work.&lt;ref name="Barkat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeger2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Yeger |first= David |title= Jerusalem, Shuʽfat (A): Final Report |journal= Hadashot Arkheologiyot – Excavations and Surveys in Israel (HA-ESI) |date= 22 January 2017 |volume= 129 |publisher= Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) |location= Jerusalem |url= http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=25163&amp;mag_id=125 |access-date= 28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the public bathhouses, the delay in finding Jewish ritual baths, and the discovery of imported Italian and Greek wine produced by non-Jews, which the very [[Kashrut|purity]]-concerned Jews of the time would have avoided, made researchers at first speculate whether the settlement might have been a mixed Jewish-Roman (pagan) one, with the bathhouses operated by Jews for the benefit of Roman soldiers.&lt;ref name="Barkat"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="JPost2006"&gt;{{cite news |title= Post-Roman [''sic''] Ancient Jewish Village Discovered: Finding calls into doubt belief that all Jews fled Holy Land after Roman destruction |author= |url= https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Post-Roman-ancient-Jewish-village-discovered |date= 4 January 2006 |access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the buildings and other findings, such rich coin hoards, cosmetics, stone vessels and imported wine, attest to the wealth of the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="MFA2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkat"/&gt;

The abandoned or destroyed site was resettled on a smaller scale in the second–fourth centuries CE, with agricultural terraces recently exposed west of Shuʽfat Street.&lt;ref name="Yeger2017"/&gt;

The place was known to the [[Crusade]]rs as ''Dersophath'' or ''Dersophach''.&lt;ref name=Pringle1997&gt;Pringle, 1997, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_NbE5obqRMC&amp;pg=PA94 94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1998, #235, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Y0tA0xLzwEC&amp;pg=PA316 316] -317&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1179, it was noted that its revenues went to the [[abbey]] of St Mary of [[Mount Zion|Mount Sion]] as the result of a grant made by Anselm de Parenti.&lt;ref&gt;Röhricht, 1893, RRH, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/regestaregnihie00rhgoog#page/n159/mode/1up 153] -154, No 576&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of a [[Crusades|Crusader]] structure in the center of the village have been found.&lt;ref name=Pringle1997/&gt; [[Victor Guérin|Guérin]] thought it was possibly a church: "One [house] which still today bears the name ''El-Kniseh'' (the church), presents the remains of a Christian sanctuary facing east, whose windows were pointed and which dates in all likelihood from the Middle Ages. Some fine [[ashlar]]s of antique appearance had been used, along with other smaller material, in the construction of this little church."&lt;ref name=Guerin395&gt;Guérin, 1868, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog01gu#page/395/mode/1up 395]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Conrad Schick|Schick]] found no church, "simply an old Crusading building with two preserved windows. The walls are about 6 feet thick, against which the [[fellaheen]] houses are built and so it is not easy to recognise. It was a kind of [[Caravanserai|khan]] built in the usual Crusading way, with a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] a little higher in the middle than semi-circular."&lt;ref&gt;Schick, 1891, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme23pale#page/n221/mode/1up 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mamluk period===
Archaeologists discovered that agricultural terraces from the area were built and covered with topsoil during the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk period]] (1260-1516).&lt;ref name="Yeger2017"/&gt;

===Ottoman period===
The village was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 Shuafat appeared in Ottoman [[daftar|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Quds of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Al-Quds|Quds]]. It had eight Muslim families who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards and other agricultural produce; a total of 2,200 [[akçe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] described Shuafat as a small village with the remains of an old wall,&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n340/mode/1up 318], vol 3, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n92/mode/1up 75]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Louis Félicien de Saulcy|de Saulcy]], who saw it in 1851, wrote that "this village has the appearance of a castle of the middle ages with a square [[keep]]."&lt;ref&gt;de Saulcy, 1854, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/narrativeajourn00warrgoog#page/n136/mode/1up 114]-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The French explorer [[Victor Guérin|Guérin]] visited in 1863 and noted that the village was situated on an elevated plateau "from which one can make out perfectly the cupolas and minarets of Jerusalem," and that it counted 150 inhabitants. He described the houses as for the most part fairly old and [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] internally.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1868, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog01gu#page/395/mode/1up 395] -402&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the remains of a church called ''al-Kanisa'', facing east. He thought it was a Frankish church.&lt;ref&gt;Ellenblum, 2003, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=riHMZiH_Te4C&amp;pg=PA241 241]&lt;/ref&gt; He also passed by in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1874, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptionsam01gu#page/185/mode/1up 185]&lt;/ref&gt; An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed 23 houses and a population of 90, counting men only.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/160/mode/1up 160]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n935/mode/1up  127] noted 26 houses&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1883, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described Shuafat as "A small village, standing on a flat spur immediately west of the watershed, surrounded with olive-trees. It has [[Water well|wells]] to the north. There is a sacred chapel of Sultan Ibrahim in the village."&lt;ref name=Conder3/&gt;  In 1896 the population of ''Scha'fat''  was estimated to be about 276 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Schick, 1896, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde19deut#page/n228/mode/1up  121]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans built a road in the same place as the old Roman road linking Jerusalem to Nablus.&lt;ref name ="JPost2006"/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
[[File:A VETERINARIAN TREATING A CAMEL AT THE GOVERNMENT VETERINARY STATION AT SHUAFAT NEAR JERUSALEM. שרותים וטרינרים לחיות ובהמות שועפט ליד ירושלים. בצילום.jpg|thumb|Government veterinary station at Shuafat in 1934]]
In the [[1922 census of Palestine]] conducted by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate authorities]], Sha'afat had a population 422, all Muslims,&lt;ref name=Census1922&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jerusalem, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n16/mode/1up 14]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing in the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] to 539, still all Muslims, in 123 houses.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 43]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]]  the population of Shu'fat was 760, all Muslims,&lt;ref name=1945p25&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VSpages/VS1945_p25.jpg   25]&lt;/ref&gt;  and it had 5,215 [[dunam]]s of land according to an official land and population survey.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Jerusalem/Page-058.jpg 58]&lt;/ref&gt; 484 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 2,111 for cereals,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20II/Jerusalem/Page-104.jpg 104]&lt;/ref&gt; while 62 dunams were built-up (urban) land.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20III/Jerusalem/Page-154.jpg 154]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordanian period===
The town of Shuafat was to be the most northernmost point of the [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|''corpus separatum'' proposed in 1947 for Jerusalem and its surrounding villages]], which "in view of its association with three world religions" was to be "accorded special and separate treatment from the rest of Palestine and should be placed under effective United Nations control".&lt;ref name=Waart&gt;{{cite book|title=Dynamics of Self-Determination in Palestine: Protection of Peoples As a|author=Paul Jacob Ignatius Maria de Waart|page=216|year=1994|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-08286-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bfkImTG1MgC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=accorded+special+and+separate+treatment+from+the+rest+of+Palestine+and+should+be+placed+under+effective+United+Nations+control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-February, during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]], leader of Palestinian irregulars in the area, tried to persuade the residents of Shuafat to attack the neighbouring Jewish village of [[Neve Yaakov]] but the invitation was declined.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1987, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=285 |title=American Newlyweds in Israel, 1948 |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2011 |publisher=[[American Jewish Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May the villagers were evacuated on orders from the [[Arab Legion]]. Shortly afterwards the [[Palmach]] captured Shuafat, destroying many of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1987, pp. 67, 113, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Shuafat was then occupied by [[Jordan]], which [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexed the West Bank]] in April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Eyāl Benveniśtî.

In 1961, the population of Shuafat was  2,541,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p.

====Shuafat refugee camp====
{{Main article|Shu'fat camp}}
[[File:ShuafatRefugeeCamp4215 l4201.JPG|thumb|Shuafat camp, 2016]]
In the wake of the 1948 war, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] accommodated Palestinian refugees in the depopulated and partly destroyed [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem's Old City.&lt;ref name=Torn&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Meron Benvenisti]] |title= Jerusalem: The Torn City |publisher= Isratypeset |year= 1976 |page= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grew into the Muaska refugee camp managed by [[UNRWA]], which housed refugees from 48 locations now in Israel.&lt;ref name=Plascov&gt;{{cite book |author= Avi Plascov |title= The Palestinian Refugees in Jordan 1948–1957 |publisher= Frank Cass |year= 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time many poor non-refugees also settled in the camp.&lt;ref name=Plascov/&gt; Conditions became unsafe for habitation due to lack of maintenance and sanitation, but neither UNRWA nor the Jordanian government wanted the negative international response that would result if they demolished the old Jewish houses.&lt;ref name=Plascov/&gt;

In 1964, a decision was made to move the refugees to a new camp constructed on mostly Jewish land near Shuafat.&lt;ref name=Plascov/&gt; Most of the refugees refused to move, since it would mean losing their livelihood, the market and the tourists, as well as reducing their access to the holy sites.&lt;ref name=Plascov/&gt; In the end, many of the refugees were moved to Shuafat by force during 1965 and 1966.&lt;ref name=Torn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plascov/&gt;

===1967, aftermath===
After the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, East Jerusalem, including the town and refugee camp, was occupied and later annexed by Israel and were incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district.&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Browning, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-israel-palestinians-jerusalem-idUSBRE9BJ0MX20131220 'In bleak Arab hinterland, hints of Jerusalem's partition,'] [[Reuters]] December 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The residents were offered Israeli citizenship, but most refused it as they considered the area to be illegally occupied. Many accepted permanent residency status instead.&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt;

According to [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem|ARIJ]], Israel has illegally and unilaterally redrawn the boundaries of Jerusalem Municipality, and confiscated 3,989 [[dunam]]s of Shu’fat  land (47% of the total town’s area) in order to establish five [[Israeli settlements]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://vprofile.arij.org/jerusalem/pdfs/vprofile/shufat.pdf Shu’fat Town Profile], ARIJ, 2013 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
*1,494 dunams of Shu’fat  land  went to [[Rekhes Shufat]] ([[Ramat Shlomo]])&lt;ref name=ARIJp14&gt;[http://vprofile.arij.org/jerusalem/pdfs/vprofile/shufat.pdf Shu’fat Town Profile], ARIJ, 2013 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
*416 dunams  of Shu’fat  land  went to  [[Ramat Eshkol]]&lt;ref name=ARIJp14/&gt;
*239 dunams of Shu’fat  land  went to [[Pisgat Amir]]&lt;ref name=ARIJp14/&gt;
*394 dunams  of Shu’fat  land  went to [[Giva't Shappira]] ([[French Hill]])&lt;ref name=ARIJp14/&gt;
*1,446 dunams  of Shu’fat  land  went to [[Ramot, Jerusalem|Ramot]] ([[Ramot Allon]])&lt;ref name=ARIJp14/&gt;

The Shuafat refugee camp is the only [[Palestinian refugee camp]] located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. While its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, which grants them the same privileges and rights as regular Israelis, the camp itself is largely serviced by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]], even though 40 - 50% of the camp's population are not registered refugees. The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some health services are provided by Israeli clinics in the camp. The Israeli presence is limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit. According to [[Ir Amim]], the camp suffers from high crime because [[Israel Police|Israeli Police]] rarely enter due to security concerns, while the [[Palestinian Civil Police Force]] does not operate in Israeli-administered municipalities. Unlike other UN-run refugee camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to the Israeli authorities.&lt;ref name=jpost1&gt;{{cite web |title= New checkpoint opened at entrance to Shuafat |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url= http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=249148 |date= December 2011 |accessdate= 2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IrAmin&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Neighborhood Profile: Shuafat Refugee Camp|publisher=[[Ir Amim]]|url=http://www.ir-amim.org.il/Eng/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/ShuafatRefugeeCampEng(1).doc|date=August 2006|accessdate=2008-02-01|format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shuafat Ridge next to the township was declared a 'green zone' to stop Palestinians in Shuafat from building there, until the opportunity arose to unfreeze its status as a green area and open it up for a new Jewish neighbourhood, as Teddy Kollek openly admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Weizman, [https://books.google.it/books?id=KfxQ5FtuCUgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation,''] Verso Books 2012 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey conducted as part of the research for the book ''Negotiating Jerusalem'' (2000), it was reported that 59% of Israeli Jews supported redefining the borders of the city of Jerusalem so as to exclude Arab settlements such as Shuafat, in order to ensure a "Jewish majority" in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;{{cite book|title=Negotiating Jerusalem|author=Jerome M. Segal|year=2000|publisher=SUNY Press|page=127|isbn=0-7914-4537-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fK80bHmpXSUC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=shuafat#PPA127,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, the Israeli authorities destroyed 14 homes under construction in Shuafat on the orders of then mayor [[Ehud Olmert]], who said the structures were built without permits. No one was yet living in them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/violence-flares-in-jerusalem-as-israeli-bulldozers-destroy-dozen-illegal-homes-677285.html Violence flares in Jerusalem as Israeli bulldozers destroy dozen 'illegal' homes]&lt;/ref&gt; The families acknowledged they do not own the land they built on, but believed they had permission to build there from Islamic Trust religious authorities and argue that obtaining permits to build legally is nearly impossible. Olmert said the houses were being constructed on public land in a "green area" and posed a security threat to the Jews of Pisgat Zeev.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Razes 14 Arab Homes at Refugee Camp|author=Tracy Wilkinson|date=July 10, 2001|page=in print edition A-4|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/10/news/mn-20441|accessdate=2008-09-07 | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Isabel Kershner]] of the [[New York Times]], Shuafat suffered from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads in 2007.&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt;

As prime minister, [[Ehud Olmert]] questioned whether the annexation of areas like Shuafat into the Jerusalem area was necessary.&lt;ref name=Ynet&gt;{{cite web|title=Olmert hints at possible concessions in Jerusalem|date=October 15, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=[[Ynet]]|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3460183,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli initiative to transfer control of the area to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] led to a split in the community: A camp official favored being under Palestinian sovereignty, while the neighborhood's [[mukhtar]] rejected the plan, citing his residents' participation in Israeli elections as well as the danger of [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]]&lt;ref name=jpost2&gt;{{cite web|title=Shuafat area residents split over plan to divide Jerusalem in two|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=79115|date=October 2007|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Sorbonne scholar Prof. Sylvaine Bulle cited the Shuafat refugee camp for its urban renewal dynamic, seeing it as an example of a creative adaptation to the fragmented space of the camps towards creating a [[bricolage]] city, with businesses relocating from east Jerusalem there and new investment in commercial projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/their-shoafat-outshines-her-paris-1.255938 |title=Their Shoafat outshines her Paris |author=Esther Zandberg |date=2008-10-23 |publisher=HAARETZ |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three stations of the First 'Red' Line of the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] are situated in Shuafat: Shuafat North, Shuafat Central and Shuafat South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypass.co.il/english/FirstLine4E.aspx Stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134929/http://www.citypass.co.il/english/FirstLine4E.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = The Jerusalem Light Rail Map| url = http://www.citypass.co.il/english/FirstLine3bigmappE.htm| journal = Citypass| accessdate = 2009-11-08| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613141427/http://www.citypass.co.il/english/FirstLine3bigmappE.htm| archivedate = 2010-06-13| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhood’s [[Main Street]], Shuafat Road, was previously part of [[Highway 60 (Israel)|route 60]]. In the 1990s a new route was built to the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lines in each direction, relieving [[traffic congestion]] along the road.

In 2014, the 16-year-old [[Kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir|Mohammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped]] from near his home in Shuafat. He was then murdered by his kidnappers, who were Jewish extremists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">Sieidi ({{lang-sme|sieidi}}, {{lang-fi|seita}}, {{lang-sv|sejte}}, {{lang-ru|сейд}}), is a [[Sami people|Sami]] cult item, usually a rock with unusual shape. Sieidis are found in nature in certain sacred places, for example at the sea or river beaches or on the mountain.&lt;ref name="Sammallahti"&gt;{{cite book|first=Phebe|last=Fjellström|title=Lappish society in tradition and the present day|year=1986|publisher= Norstedt |location= Stockholm |p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sieidi has also been used for holy rocks or wooden figures that have undergone some processing. The victory was a symbol of the divine power ruling over the natural resources that humans needed for their survival. Samis sacrificed parts of their catch at sea to get a successful hunting or fishing in the future.

In [[southern Sami]], the name varies between viero-gierkie (sacrifice stone), viero-moere (sacrificial wood), soul-gierkie (goose-goat) and soul-nut (goose-tree).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1299">The '''Silicon Valley Tarot''' is a modern, spoof [[Tarot]] deck published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] with the tagline "Cheaper than a consultant. Same Results". It was conceived and created by [[Thomas Scoville]], who also wrote the accompanying book of interpretations.

All the cards in this deck relate to the world of [[information technology|IT]] and computing.

The suits are Networks, Cubicles, Disks and Hosts, and the court cards—instead of  being King, Queen, Knight and Page—are [[Chief information officer|CIO]], Marketeer, Salesman and New Hire.

The major arcarna consists of: The Hacker, Venture Capital, The Network, The Consultant, [[Initial public offering|IPO]], The [[Futurist]], The Layoff, [[Spam (electronic)|Spam]], The Server, The Stockholder, The Next Big Thing, The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], Flame War, Bugs, The Guru, Double Latte, Stock Options, Sea of Cubicles, Encryption, Firewall, [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], The [[System administrator|Sysadmin]], and The Garage.

The deck is currently out of print. A deck in used condition last sold on eBay for $227.61.

==History of Teatr Tworzenia (The Theater of Creation)==

The '''Text Services Framework (TSF)''' is a [[Component Object Model|COM]] [[Software framework|framework]] and [[API]] in [[Windows XP]] and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating systems]] that supports advanced text input and text processing. The Text Services Framework is designed to offer advanced language and [[word processing]] features to applications. It supports features such as multilingual support, keyboard drivers, [[handwriting recognition]], [[speech recognition]], as well as [[Spell checker|spell checking]] and other text and [[natural language processing]] functions. It is also downloadable for older Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com:80/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11759|title=Download: Platform SDK Redistributable: Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework Redist files|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713081945/http://www.microsoft.com:80/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11759|archive-date=June 13, 2012|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Language Bar''' is the core [[user interface]] for Text Services Framework. The language bar enables text services to add UI elements to the toolbar and enables these elements when an application has focus. From the Language Bar, users can select the input language, and control keyboard input, handwriting recognition and speech recognition.

The language bar also provides a direct means to switch between installed languages, even when a non-TSF-enabled application has focus.

Starting with [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] 2005 and [[Windows Vista]], the [[RichEdit]] control  supports the Text Services Framework. [[Windows Speech Recognition]] in Windows Vista is also implemented using the Text Services Framework.

== Features of TSF ==

*TSF is extensible. [[Independent Software Vendor|ISVs]] can write their own text processing feature for TSF.
*TSF-enabled applications can receive text input from any text service that supports TSF without having to be aware of any details of the text source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/what-is-text-services-framework|title=What is Text Services Framework?|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services built using TSF are globally available to any application.
*TSF enables a text service to store [[metadata]] with a document, a piece of text, or an object within the document. For example, a speech input text service can store sound information associated with a block of text.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/why-use-text-services-framework|title=Why Use Text Services Framework?|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TSF enables text services to provide accurate and complete text conversion, with continuous access to the document buffer. Text services using TSF can avoid separating their functionality into modes for input and modes for editing. This input architecture enables the buffered and accumulating text stream to change dynamically, thereby enabling more efficient keyboard input and text editing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*TSF is [[Device Independence|device-independent]] and enables text services for multiple input devices including [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[electronic pen]] or stylus, and [[microphone]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
A [[Scotsman]], an [[Englishman]] and an [[Irishman]] all ran away from the army together. After several days, the Scotsman saw a castle, went to it without speaking to the others, and met a lady. At his request, she gave him a meal and a bed to sleep. And then the same thing happened to the Englishman.

The Irishman saw the same castle and went to it, but when the lady gave him food, he stared about the castle and did not eat. When she asked, he said he could not eat without knowing who she was or where she came from, or how she came there. She told him she was an [[incantation|enchanted]] [[Princess and dragon|princess]], and if a man stayed in a little room from ten until midnight for [[rule of three (writing)|three]] nights running, she would be freed. Every night creatures came into the room and beat him, but the princess had a [[potion|bottle]] that cured him every morning.

She went off and told him she would back in a coach and six. A little lad came, and when he went to wait for the princess, the lad stuck a pin in his coat, putting him to sleep. When the princess came, the lad told her he was asleep. The princess said she would come once more, and then he would not see her again. The Irishman resolved to keep awake, but the boy stuck the pin in his coat again, and the princess left, leaving him a sword.

He woke up the other men in the castle and gave them silver and plate to carry away and set out in search of her. Three years later, he pulled out the sword in order to kill himself and found written on it, You will find me in the Blue Mountains. He set out in search of the Blue Mountains and found an old man who had not seen anyone in three hundred years. The old man, that night, looked through his book, which contained the history of the world, but found nothing of where the Blue Mountains were. He blew a [[magical item|magical whistle]], which let the Irishman travel to his brother's, nine hundred miles away, in a day. This brother summoned all the birds to consult them. Last of all, an eagle came; it had come from the Blue Mountains. The eagle said that the daughter of the king of the Blue Mountains was about to marry, because she had agreed with her father that if the man who had saved her had not arrived in that time, she would marry. 

The eagle said if they killed sixty cattle and the Irishman would throw quarter of one into its mouth every time it turned its head, it could carry him. So he and the old man hunted, and it flew off with him and the meat, but near the castle, the meat ran out, and the eagle threw him off. He landed in the bay and was able to get ashore. He gave a guinea to the king's [[:wiktionary:henwife|henwife]] to bring the princess to him. She recognized the Irishman and married him instead of her new [[False hero|bridegroom]].

{{about|the phrase||The Man (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=April 2012}}

"'''The Man'''" is a [[slang]] phrase that may refer to the [[government]] or to some other [[authority]] in a position of power. In addition to this derogatory connotation, it may also serve as a term of respect and praise. 

The phrase "the Man is keeping me down" is commonly used to describe [[oppression]]. The phrase "stick it to the Man" encourages [[civil resistance|resistance to authority]], and essentially means "fight back" or "resist", either passively, openly or via [[sabotage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=stick it to the man|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-stick+it+to+the+man.html|publisher=AllWords.com (English Dictionary - With Multi-Lingual Search)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a phrase meaning "the boss" it dates from at least 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=man| title=Online Etymological Dictionary entry for "Man" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. Southern states|Southern U.S. states]], the phrase came to be applied to any man or any group in a position of authority, or to authority in the abstract. From about the 1950s the phrase was also an [[Organized crime|underworld]] code word for [[police]], the warden of a [[prison]] or other law enforcement or penal authorities.

The use of this term was expanded to counterculture groups and their battles against authority, such as the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]], which, according to a May 19, 1969 article in ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', had the "avowed aim ... to destroy 'The Man', their term for the present system of government". The term eventually found its way into humorous usage, such as in a December 1979 motorcycle ad from the magazine ''[[Easyriders]]'' which featured the [[tagline]], "[[California]] residents: Add 6% sales tax for The Man."

In present day, the phrase has been popularized in commercials and cinema. It was featured particularly prominently as a recurring motif in the 2003 film ''[[School of Rock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332379/quotes|title=School of Rock (2003)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Undercover Brother]]'' had as a plot element a fictional organization headed by "The Man", an actual man in charge of oppressing African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=David J|title=Screens Fade to Black: Contemporary African American Cinema|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=169–170|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as praise===
The term has also been used as an approbation or form of praise. This may refer to the recipient's status as the leader or authority within a particular context, or it might be assumed to be a shortened form of a phrase like "He is the man (who is in charge)."

In more modern usage, it can be a superlative compliment ("you da man!") indicating that the subject is currently standing out amongst his peers even though they have no special designation or rank, such as a [[basketball]] player who is performing better than the other players on the court. It can also be used as a genuine compliment with an implied, slightly exaggerated or sarcastic tone, usually indicating that the person has indeed impressed the speaker but by doing something relatively trivial.

[[File:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper'']]

'''''The Plumb-pudding in danger, or, State Epicures taking un Petit Souper''''', is an 1805 [[editorial cartoon]] by the English artist [[James Gillray]].  The [[popular print]] depicts caricatures of the [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger]] and the newly-crowned [[Emperor of France]] [[Napoleon]], both wearing military uniforms, carving up a [[terrestrial globe]] into [[spheres of influence]].  It was published as a hand-coloured print and has been described by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] as "probably Gillray's most famous print" and by the [[British Library]] as "one of Gillray’s most famous satires dealing with the Napoleonic wars".

==Background==
Gillray's print is a satire on the overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain during the [[War of the Third Coalition]].  The short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]], a treaty between Britain and France, had ended in 1803, and Napoleon was [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|threatening to invade Britain]] with his [[Grande Armée]] based at Boulogne.  

The peace overtures came to naught: before the end of the year, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet would be decisively defeated by the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], giving Britain unrivalled control of the seas, but Napoleon would establish a dominant position in Europe by first defeating an Austrian army through manoeuvre in the [[Ulm Campaign]], and then winning a great victory over a combined Russian-Austrian army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], ending the Third Coalition with the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]].

==Description==
Pitt and Napoleon are seated on opposite sides of a [[dining table]], each using a [[carving knife]] and [[carving fork]] to cut pieces from a large spherical [[plum pudding]] bearing a [[world map|map of the world]], with the [[British Isles]] at the centre between them.  The scene is replete with iconography referring to the contemporary political situation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].
 
Pitt, sitting to the left, is depicted tall and emaciated.  He wears a [[red coat (military uniform)|red regimental uniform]] of the [[British Army]] - perhaps the [[Cinque Port Volunteer Corps]] that he had raised in Kent - with powdered hair in a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]], and a cocked [[tricorn]] hat.  His fork resembles a three-pronged trident, referring to Britain's naval might, and he is carving a slice of sea to the west of the British Isles marked "ocean" and "[[West Indies]]".  

Napoleon, to the right, the "little corporal", is much smaller in height and stockier in build, with a prominent hooked nose.  He wears the blue coat of the [[Imperial French Army]], and his large fore-and-aft [[bicorn]] hat has an extravagant feather plume reminiscent of a [[Gallic rooster|French cock]].  His large knife resembles a military sword, and his two-pronged fork is embedded over a region marked "[[Hanover]]", home of the ruling British monarchs of the [[House of Hanover]].  He is cutting away a slice of land to the east of the British Isles marked "Europe", but his piece of land is much smaller than Pitt's portion of sea.  

The pudding rests on a large gold platter at the centre of the table, which is covered by a white tablecloth.  Pitt and Napoleon each have a smaller gold plate ready for their slices, Pitt's bearing the [[British Royal Coat of Arms]] and Napoleon's an [[imperial crown]].  The back of Pitt's chair is decorated with the image of lion carrying a [[cross of St George]] (sometimes a [[Union Flag]]) and Napoleon's has an [[French Imperial Eagle|Imperial eagle]] clutching a [[Phrygian cap|''bonnet rouge'']].  

The printing plate measures {{convert|10.25|x|14.25|in}} and was typically impressed on paper measuring around {{convert|10.5|x|15|in}}.  The print includes at top left the title "The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper" the latter half in French, meaning 'state [[gourmet]]s taking a little [[supper]]' - "Epicures" refers to the Greek [[hedonist]] philosopher [[Epicurus]].  Below this is a quotation attributed to [[William Windham]] in the ''[[Political Register]]'' newspaper, but actually taken from Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', Act 4, Scene 1, lines 153-4:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"The great Globe itself and all which it inherit", is too small to satisfy such insatiable appetites.
                                                         - - Vide Mr W-d-m's eccentricities, in ye Political Register.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An inscription also records that the print was designed and made by James Gillray, but it was not numbered or signed.

==Reception==
The print was published by [[Hannah Humphrey]], of 27 [[St James's Street]] in London, on 26 February 1805, and was originally sold for about five shillings.  There are examples in many museum and private collections.  It has been described by [[Martin Rowson]] as "probably the most famous political cartoon of all time … stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Rowson]], speaking on ''The Secret of Drawing'', presented by [[Andrew Graham Dixon]], [[BBC Television]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Tzippori Synagogue''' ('''Sepphoris Synagogue''') is an ancient synagogue discovered in [[Tzippori]], a Roman-era Jewish city in the [[Galilee]], now an archaeological site and a national park in [[Israel]]. 

==History==
Based on numismatic evidence, the synagogue appears to have been built in the first half of the fifth century. It was located on the northern side of the city, not far from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/Zippori/mosaic.htm The Mosaic Pavements of Roman and Byzantine Zippori]&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring 20.7 meters long and 8 meters wide, it is the narrowest ancient synagogue uncovered in the [[Land of Israel]]. The [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was located in the western wall, not oriented towards Jerusalem as in other synagogues of that era.&lt;ref name=aviam&gt;Mordechai Aviam, ''Ancient Synagogues in the Land of Israel'', Israel Nature and Parks Authority, 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mishna]] describes Tzippori as having had 18 synagogues at the time of the funeral of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] in the late second century CE.&lt;ref name=aviam/&gt;

==Discovery==
The mosaic floor of the ancient synagogue was discovered in 1993 by a crew building a parking lot at the edge of the national archaeological park of Tzippori.&lt;ref name=art&gt;Steven Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a handful of illustrated synagogue mosaics uncovered in Israel. Archaeologist [[Zeev Weiss]], then a graduate student at the Hebrew University, and his teacher, archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] were called to the scene, and Weiss uncovered the floor and its environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23883856/The-Sepphoris-Synagogue-Deciphering-an-Ancient-Message-through-Its-Archaeological-and-SocioHistorical-Contexts|title=The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|date= May 2006|author=Steven Fine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaics==
The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting [[Sarah]]. The next section shows the binding of [[Isaac]]. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. Next, there is a row of three panels depicting the offerings in the [[Temple at Jerusalem]], including the [[Kodashim|"tamid" sacrifice]], the [[showbread]] and the basket of [[first fruits]]. Above this is a depiction of [[Aaron]] offering sacrifices in the [[Tabernacle]]. Above that is another row of three panels, a [[Torah Ark]], depicted as a pedimented building, and an incense shovel representing the incense shovels used in the Temple, flanked by two panels each displaying the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] from the Temple at Jerusalem surrounded by symbols of the Jewish holidays including the [[Lulav]] and [[Shofar]]. The top, or front of the building section of the floor, another row of three panels, shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Weiss, ''The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts''.Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society; Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The largest panel or central sections of the mosaic is laid out as a large square containing a circle within a circle. This shows the Zodiac with Helios driving his chariot. As with the [[Hammat Tiberias Synagogue]] and the [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]], the Zodiac panel at Tzippori features [[Spandrels]] depicting the four seasons.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

'''''Volga Se Ganga''''' ({{lang-hi|वोल्गा से गंगा}}, ''A journey from the [[Volga river|Volga]] to the [[Ganges]]'')  is a 1943 collection of 20 historical fiction short-stories by scholar and travel writer [[Rahul Sankrityayan]]. A true vagabond, Sankrityayan traveled to far lands like Russia, [[Korea]], Japan, China and many others, where he mastered the languages of these lands and was an authority on cultural studies. 

The stories collectively trace the migration of [[Aryan]]s from the [[steppe]]s of the [[Eurasia]] to regions around the [[Volga river]]; then their movements across the [[Hindukush]] and the [[Himalaya]]s and the sub-Himalayan regions; and their spread to the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent of India]]. The book begins in 6000&amp;nbsp;BC and ends in 1942, the year when [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Indian nationalist leader called for the [[Quit India|quit India movement]].

==Publication history and translations==
Sanskritayan wrote his debut novel ''Jine Ke Liye'' in 1938. Meanwhile, 1941-42, he was inspired by the historical stories of Bhagawat Sharan Upadhyay. Later he wrote 20 short stories while imprisoned in [[Hazaribagh]] Central Jail for taking part in Indian independence movement. &lt;ref name="Machwe1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhakar Machwe|title=Rahul Sankrityayan (Hindi Writer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kPPlgMiM388C&amp;pg=PA42|date=1998|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-845-0|pages=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1943 and is considered one of the greatest [[Hindi]] book of modern [[Indian literature]].&lt;ref name="Machwe1998"/&gt; 

It has been translated into many languages including [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], English, [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] where he ran into several editions, besides foreign languages like Russian, Czech, Polish Chinese, and many more. &lt;ref name="Machwe1998"/&gt; This book is now considered a classic in history of [[Indian Literature]]. The first [[Bengali language|Bengali]] translation was published in 1954.

==Synopsis==
Volga Se Ganga is about the history of Indo–European people who were later known as the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]].  The 20 stories are woven over a span of 8000 years and a distance of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km. 

The first story, "Nisha", is about cavemen living in [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] (southern Russia) about 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. The society or its precursor at that time was [[matriarchal]] and so the story is named after the leader of the family 'Nisha'. Although all the 20 stories are independent, the sequence in which they are arranged nevertheless serves a very important purpose. Here one can find a gradual transformation from a matriarchal society (the first two stories) to a patriarchal one (the rest), a gradual change from freedom to slavery, from acceptance of slavery to its loathing and the likes. If one is to believe Sankrityayan, then an apprehension for technological advancement is nothing new. People were wary of the newly better armament which was fast replacing the older stone equipment (fourth story – "Puruhoot" ([[Tajikistan]] 2500 BC)). The same story tells how an arms race was started during that period and how southerners amassed great wealth at the expense of the northerners. 

The sixth story, "Angira" ([[Taxila]] 1800 BC), is about a man who wants to save the [[Aryan]] race from losing its identity to other races by teaching about their true culture (precursor to [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]]). The eighth story (''Pravahan'' (700 BC. [[Panchala]], U.P.). is about the upper class manipulating religion for their own vested interests and conspiring to keep people in dark for at least 2000 years).  One can see how easily and frequently the Indians, the mid easterners and the [[Greeks]] mingled with each other in the times of [[Chanakya]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] by reading the tenth story ''Nagdatt'', which is about a philosopher classmate of [[Chanakya]] who travels to [[Persia]] and [[Greece]] and learns how [[Athens]] fell to [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The eleventh story (''Prabha'', 50 AD) is about the famous (also the first Indian) dramatist [[Aśvaghoṣa]], who adopted the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] art of drama into [[Indian culture]] in a very beautiful and authentic way, and his inspiration. ''Baba Noordeen'' (1300), the 15th story is about the rise of [[Sufism]]. The seventeenth story ''Rekha Bhagat'' (1800 is about the barbarous rule of the East India company and the anarchy it brought to parts of India. The last story ("Sumer", 1942) is about a man who goes on to fight the Japanese because he wants [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Russia]] to triumph, for this nation according to him is the only hope left for humanity.

==About the author==
[[Rahul Sankrityayan]] was greatly influenced by [[Marxist]] ideas. This influence can be easily felt in the last three stories. Mangal Singh (the protagonist in 18th story) personally knows [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] and is amazed how Marx knows so much about [[India]]. He explains to Anne, his beloved, how Science is indispensable to India but unfortunately the Indians put faith above it. He goes on to fight the Britishers in the 1857 uprising with a strict code of conduct.

The author (original name ''Kedarnath Pandey'') was so deeply influenced by [[Buddhism]] that he adopted it along with the name ''Rahul'' (The name of [[Gautam Buddha]]'s son). This influence is also felt in his stories ''Bandhul Mall'' (490 BC, 9th story) and ''Prabha''. Also the dynamical view of life which is at the centre of [[Buddhist]] philosophy can be seen. One more characteristic feature that deserves mention here is the simplicity of language. There are no pointless linguistic decorations here. The author instantly gets to the point just like [[Voltaire]] with ''Candide''.

'''Włodzimierz Borodziej''' (born 9 September 1956 in [[Warsaw]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] historian and writer specializing in contemporary European history with particular focus on Polish-German relations. Borodziej is a professor of humanistic sciences, and former [[prorector]] of the [[Warsaw University]].

==Biography==
Włodzimierz Borodziej is the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Wiktor Borodziej (1929–2004) from the former Polish secret police [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] who reportedly helped his son acquire German high school education in Berlin and in Vienna while serving abroad.&lt;ref name="Olszak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niezalezna.pl/article/show/id/27530/articlePage/3 |title=Z gwiazdozbioru Wywiadu PRL |publisher=Gazeta Polska |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |author=Tadeusz Olszak |language=Polish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120190609/http://www.niezalezna.pl/article/show/id/27530/articlePage/3 |archivedate=November 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of his father and his involvement with the secret operation ''Żelazo'' (Iron) against political targets in Western Europe,&lt;ref name="Milewicz"/&gt; has caused some controversy in Polish academia, as some comentators see it as irrelevant, and an attempt to discredit his son's work due to family background.&lt;ref name="Milewicz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,5710728,Jak_IPN_zalatwil_prof__Borodzieja.html |title=Jak IPN załatwił prof.

Włodzimierz Borodziej graduated with a [[master's degree]] from the [[Warsaw University]] in 1979. In 1984 Borodziej received a title of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from his own [[alma mater]], followed by [[habilitation]] earned in 1991 for his scientific treatise ''Poland in international relations between 1945 and 1947'' (''Polska w stosunkach międzynarodowych 1945-1947''). In 2004 he received the title of professor of humanistic sciences at Warsaw University, where in 1999–2002 Borodziej served as prorector (deputy to university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nauka.opi.org.pl/dhtml/raporty/ludzieNauki?rtype=opis&amp;objectId=56433&amp;lang=pl Włodzimierz Borodziej] at ''Nauka Polska'' database of Polish scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuw.pl/biogramy/index.php?UID=36&amp;UIJ=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10 Włodzimierz Borodziej] at the Institute of History of [[Warsaw University]].&lt;/ref&gt;
