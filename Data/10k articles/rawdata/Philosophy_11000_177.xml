      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10142">Active Perception is where an agents' behaviors are selected in order to increase the information content derived from the flow of sensor data obtained by those behaviors in the environment in question.  In other words, in order to understand the world we move around and explore it.  We sample the world through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue as we explore and construct an understanding (Perception) of the environment on the basis of this behavior (Action).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The senses considered as perceptual systems.|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1966|isbn=978-0313239618|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the construct of Active Perception, the interpretation of sensor data (perception) is inherently inseparable from the behaviors required to capture that data - action (behaviors) and perception (interpretation of sensor data) are tightly coupled.  This has been developed most comprehensively with respect to vision ([[Active vision|Active Vision]]) where  an agent (animal, robot, human, camera mount) changes position in order to improve the view of a specific object and/or where the agent uses movement in order to perceive the environment (e.g. for obstacle avoidance).

More formally Active Perception has been defined as follows:

"Active Perception (Active Vision specifically) is defined as a study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and their interaction. We distinguish local models from global models by their extent of application in space and time. The local models represent procedures and parameters such as optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the other hand characterize the overall performance and make predictions on how the individual modules interact. The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from focus and sterolvergence on 2-0 segmentation of an image and 3-0 shape parametrization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bajcsy|first=Ruzena|date=August 1988|title=Active Perception|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yang/courses/cs294-6/papers/Bajcsy.active%20Perception.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=76, 8|pages=996–1005|via=|doi=10.1109/5.5968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical flow|The theory of Optical Flow]] was derived from concepts of Active Perception, and while optical flow is now typically considered to be a vector representation of motion captured by a vision sensor (camera), it was originally described in terms of Active Perception.  The behavior of the agent (animal, robot, human) in the world generates a flow of data over the visual sensor (camera, eye) which is sampled by the sensor and interpreted into a percept of the environment by the agent, through some computation.  On the basis of this percept the agent then selects another behavior that generates more data flow.  Thus Optical Flow is the data flow carried by light from the environment to the vision sensor as a result of movement in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of the Visual World|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1950|isbn=978-1114828087|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a related but narrower definition of '''active perception''' that [[perception]] and action are represented within the brain as the same thing. It states that when a person sees an action done, it is internally translated into, and understood within the context of, an action that they could do. This supports the capability in people and animals of learning what to do based on what they see others doing.&lt;ref&gt;(Bargh &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2001, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological Psychology==
Active Perception is part of the broader field of [[ecological psychology]]. Ecological Psychology (and theories of Ecological Perception) was formulated by [[gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by Gibson through the 1950s to 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1979, The [[Ecological Theory of Perception]], Haughton and Mifflin, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has held strong, although for the approximately 80 years that it has been around, it has always been considered a niche area of [[psychology]]. Ecological Perception has had little traction in medicine, for instance, until recently, when a series of coherent hypotheses proposed that active perception is the basis for developmental disorders and psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011). Understanding 'what' others do: mirror mechanisms play a crucial role in action perception. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 6(3), 257-259. {{doi|10.1093/scan/nsr004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buccino | first1 = G. | last2 = Amore | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Mirror neurons and the understanding of behavioural symptoms in psychiatric disorders | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 3| page = 281 | doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e3282fbcd32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fabbri-Destro | first2 = M. | last3 = Cattaneo | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Mirror neurons and their clinical relevance | url = | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Neurology | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 24–34 | doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition of objects and opportunities (or ''[[affordances]]'') as they are called by Gibson, is a function of the Ecological Perception. A glass of water is recognized through the fact that it supports a desire to drink, and a book by reading, although usually affordances are considered at a more basic level e.g. that rock affords me to sit upon it. The fact that most people don't read every book that comes their way, drink every glass of water, or sit on every rock, is thought to be a function of a secondary inhibition process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus people with damaged inhibitory circuitry (in the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain) have no choice but to act in the face of perception. The classic examples are in the studies of [[environmental dependence syndrome]] and [[utilization behavior]] by.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011).

== Applications of Active Perception ==
There is a wide range of work on the application of active perception to robotics, including ground vehicles, underwater vehicles, and air vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;oq=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3761j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Google search for "Active Perception in Robotics"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As one would expect, when optical flow is included in the definition of active perception then the volume of related work significantly increases.

[[Image:Ibn Arabi.jpg|thumb|right|Ibn Arabi (Murcia July 28, 1165 – Damascus November 10, 1240)]]
[[File:Ibn-al-Arabi-Plain-of-Assembly.jpg|thumb|Diagram of "Plain of Assembly"(''Ard al-Hashr)'' on the Day of Judgment, from autograph manuscript of ''Futuhat al-Makkiyya'', ca. 1238 (photo: after ''Futuhat al-Makkiyya'', Cairo edition, 1911).]]

'''Akbariyya''' is a branch of [[Sufi metaphysics]] based on [[Ibn Arabi]]'s teachings, an [[Andalusia]]n [[Sufi]] who was a [[gnostic]] and philosopher. The word is derived from [[Ibn Arabi]]'s nickname, "[[Shaykh]] al-Akbar," meaning "the greatest shaykh." Akbariyya has never been used to indicate a Sufi group or society in history; it may nowadays refer to all historical or contemporary Sufi [[metaphysicians]] and Sufis influenced by Ibn Arabi's doctrine [[Wahdat al-Wujud]]. It is not to be confused with [[Al Akbariyya]], a secret Sufi society founded by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] Sufi '''[[Ivan Aguéli|'Abdu l-Hadi Aguéli]]'''.

== Wahdat al-Wujud ==

'''[[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat al-Wajud]]''' (Arabic: وحدة الوجود Persian: وحدت وجود) meaning the "unity of being" is a [[Sufi]] philosophy emphasizing that 'there is no true existence except the Ultimate Truth (God)' or in other words, that the only [[truth]] within the [[universe]] is God, and that all things exist within God only.

[[Ibn Arabi]] is most often characterized in Islamic texts as the originator of this doctrine. However, it is not found in his works. The first to employ this term was [[Ibn Sabin]].

Ibn Arabi's disciple and stepson [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]] used this term in his works and explained it using philosophical terms.

See [[Sufi metaphysics]]

==Akbariyya in Academic Circles ==

=== Europa and United States ===

In the 20th century there has been focus on the Akbariyya School in academic circles and universities.
Viewed in a historical context, increased government support for the study of the Muslim world and Islamic languages emerged in the United States after the Second World War where many students were attracted to Islam and religious studies during the 1970s.

The greatest growth in American scholarship on Sufism, then, has arisen from the work done by scholars trained during the 1970s. [[Alexander Knysh]] notes that “in the decades after World War Two the majority of Western experts in Sufism were no longer based in Europe, but in North America.” [[Henri Corbin]] (d.1978) and [[Fritz Meier]] (d. 1998) who were prominent among these experts, made important contributions to the study of Islamic mysticism. Another important names were [[Miguel Asín Palacios]] (d. 1944), [[Louis Massignon]] (d. 1962) made contributions to Ibn Arabi studies. While Palacios discovered some Akbarian elements in [[Dante]]'s famous work Divine Comedy [[Louis Massignon]] studied on famous Sufi [[Al-Hallaj]] saying "Anal Hak" (I am the Truth) and because of that expression he was executed.

[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and his students and academic disciples, has come to play an important role in certain subfields of Sufi studies. The Influence of Nasr and other Traditionalist writers like [[Rene Guenon]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]] on Sufi studies could be seen on the interpretation of the works of Ibn Arabi and the Akbarian school by such scholars as [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[James W. Morris|James Morris]], [[William Chittick]], and [[Sachiko Murata]] and others. These names are both mostly practitioners of Sufism and scholars studying Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/920_ajiss24-3-stripped%20-%20Hermansen%20-%20The%20Academic%20Study%20of%20Sufism.pdf |title=The Academic Study of Sufism at American Universities |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815170437/http://i-epistemology.net/attachments/920_ajiss24-3-stripped%20-%20Hermansen%20-%20The%20Academic%20Study%20of%20Sufism.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===

Historically viewed, Turkey is where Ibn Arabi's most prominent disciple, successor and stepson [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]] and other important commentators of Arabi's works lived on.
[[Dawūd al-Qayṣarī]] was invited to [[Iznik]] by [[Orhan Ghazi]] to be director and teacher of the first Ottoman university (madrasa) was the disciple of Kamāl al-Dīn al-Qāshānī, himself a disciple of Sadr al-Dīn al-Qūnawī. This means that the official teaching itself was set in motion by a great master of the Akbarian school. Not only Sufis but also Ottoman sultans, politicians and intellectuals had been deeply impressed by Ibn Arabi and his disciples and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/ottomanera.html Mustafa Tahrali, A General Outline of the Influence of Ibn 'Arabi on the Ottoman Era]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Seyyed Muhammad Nur al-Arabi]] was also impressed by Ibn Arabi's doctrine, though that continued to decrease until the Modern Era. In the 20th century the last important commentator of Fusûs was Ahmed Avni Konuk (d. 1938). He was a mawlawî and composer of Turkish music.

Studies on Sufism, especially Akbarian works, were not very common until the first Ph.D. thesis was written by Prof.Dr. Mahmud Erol Kılıc in [[Marmara University]]'s Faculty of [[Theology]] titled "Ibn 'Arabi's Ontology" (in Turkish, "Muhyiddin İbn Arabi'de Varlık ve Varlık Mertebeleri") in 1995. Academic studies on Akbarian metaphysics and philosophy began to rise after studies on this topics were conducted by Turkish scholars such as Mustafa Tahralı and Mahmud Erol Kılıc.

In terms of Akbarian studies, the most important event to take place was the translation of Ibn Arabi's [[magnum opus]],"Futuhat-ı Makkiyya", to Turkish. A Turkish scholar, Prof. Dr. Ekrem Demirli started translating the work in the form of 18 volumes in 2006 and finished in 2012. This particular translation was the first complete translation to another language. Demirli's work also includes translating [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]]'s corpus to Turkish and writing a PhD thesis on him in 2004, writing a commentary on Fusus al-Hikam by Ibn Arabi, and writing a book titled ''İslam Metafiziğinde Tanrı ve İnsan'' (God and Human in Islamic Metaphysics), [Istanbul: Kabalcı, 2009 ({{ISBN|9759971623}})].

There are many Akbarian works in Ottoman Turkish that are yet to be studies by scholars.

== List of some Akbarian Sufis ==

There had and have been many Akbarian Sufis, metaphysicians and philosophers in history from all over the world. Ibn Arabi has never founded a [[Tarikah]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/diffusion.html Michel Chodkiewicz, The Diffusion of Ibn 'Arabi's Doctrine]&lt;/ref&gt; but created the philosophy of Wahdat al-Wujud.

'''Alfred the Great''' ({{lang-ang|Ælfrēd}},{{efn|Pronounced {{IPA-ang|ælfreːd}}}} {{lang|ang|Ælfrǣd}},{{efn|Pronounced {{IPA-ang|ælfræːd}}}} "elf counsel" or "wise elf"; 849 – 26 October 899) was [[King of Wessex]] from 871 to c. 886 and [[King of the Anglo-Saxons]] from c. 886 to 899.

Alfred was the youngest son of King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers reigned in turn. Taking the throne after the death of his brother [[Æthelred of Wessex|Æthelred]], Alfred spent several years dealing with Viking invasions. After a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 Alfred made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as [[Danelaw]] in the [[North of England]]. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of the Viking leader, [[Guthrum]].

Alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the [[Viking]] attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in [[England]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27–28 }} He was also the first [[List of kings of Wessex|King of the West Saxons]] to style himself "[[King of the Anglo-Saxons]]". Details of Alfred's life are described in a work by the [[9th century in England|9th-century]] [[Welsh people|Welsh]] scholar and bishop [[Asser]].

Alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|English]] rather than Latin, and improved his kingdom's [[law|legal]] system, [[military]] structure, and his people's quality of life. He was given the [[epithet]] "the Great" during and after the [[Reformation]] in the sixteenth century. The only other king of England given this epithet is [[Cnut the Great]]. In 2002, Alfred was ranked number 14 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].

==Childhood==
{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}
[[File:Æthelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father Æthelwulf in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]
Alfred was born in the village of Wanating, now [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]]. He was the youngest son of King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]].{{efn|Alfred was the youngest of either four (Weir, Alison, ''Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy'' (1989), p.5) or five brothers,{{sfn|Crown staff|2011}} the primary record conflicting regarding whether [[Æthelstan of Wessex]] was a brother or uncle.}}

In 853, at the age of four, Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who "anointed him as king".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a "[[consul]]"; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854–855.

On their return from Rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed by his son [[Æthelbald of Wessex|Æthelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, [[Æthelberht of Wessex|Æthelberht]] and [[Æthelred of Wessex|Æthelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}

Bishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won as a prize a book of Saxon poems, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303–05}} Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc="Historical Note" (p. 385 and following)}}

==Reigns of Alfred's brothers==
[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]

Alfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers Æthelbald and Æthelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]], an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16–17}} Alfred's public life began at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old King Æthelred, in 865.

During this period, Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of "secundarius", which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic "[[Tanistry|tanist]]", a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle. It is well known among other [[Germanic peoples]] to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander, such as among the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] and [[Franks]], to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.

===Fighting the Viking invasion===
In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the [[Great Heathen Army]] led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}}  The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with varying outcomes, though the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.

A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|siege and Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}

The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April.

==King at war==

===Early struggles, defeat and flight===
In April 871 King Æthelred died and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, [[Æthelhelm]] and [[Æthelwold of Wessex|Æthelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at "Swinbeorg". The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them, and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.

While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140–41}}

Indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser, or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140–41}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91–110}}

In 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a "holy ring"{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}} associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=37}} The Danes broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}

Alfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and, with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, "and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe."{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}

A legend, originating from 12th century chronicles,{{sfn|Crown staff|2011}} tells how when he first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.

878 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}

===Counter-attack and victory===
[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on the supposed site of "Egbert's Stone", the mustering place before the [[Battle of Edington]].{{efn|The inscription reads "ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY" {{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}} }}]]

In the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to [[Egbert's Stone]] east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]] where he was met by "all the people of Somerset and of [[Wiltshire]] and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of [[Southampton Water]]), and they rejoiced to see him".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187–91}}

Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}

According to Asser:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A "chrisom" was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[baptism|baptised]] or christened. Originally the purpose of the chrisom-cloth was to keep the "chrism", a consecrated oil, from accidentally rubbing off.{{sfn|Nares|1859|p=160}}}} on the eighth day took place at a royal estate called [[Wedmore]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 56}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While at Wedmore Alfred and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], but it was to be some years after the cessation of hostilities that a formal treaty was signed.{{sfn|Horspool|2006|pages=123–24}} Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. {{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as "[[Quadripartitus]]", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}

That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98–101, [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}

In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints—at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105–24}} The disposition of [[Essex]], held by West Saxon kings since the days of [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], is unclear from the treaty though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.

===Quiet years, restoration of London (880s)===
{{further|Londinium|Anglo-Saxon London}}
[[File:Alfred king of Wessex London 880.jpg|thumb|A coin of Alfred, king of Wessex, London, 880 (based upon a Roman model).&lt;br /&gt;'''''Obv''''': King with royal band in profile, with legend: ÆLFRED REX "King Ælfred"]]

With the signing of the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling [[East Anglia]], Guthrum was neutralised as a threat.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=94}} The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879–892.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=250–51}}

Alfred was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships "on the high seas",{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces.{{sfn|Alfred|1969|p=76}} Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.

In 883—though there is some debate over the year—King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=78}} Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}

After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}

Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, "laden with spoils".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}

[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]
A year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[Æthelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|Æthelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}

This is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[Æthelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Æthelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=89}}
[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]

Guthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further Viking attacks repelled (890s)===
After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]], and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}

While he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115–16, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and, after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115–16, 286}}

Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege]] of [[Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}

Meanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and, forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}

Early in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}

==Military reorganisation==
[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871–899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM "Ælfred King of the Saxons".]]
The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59–60}}
According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694:
{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52–53}} }}

Wessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194–95}}

In contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194–95}}

These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194–95}}

The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}

With these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration and taxation===
Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called "common burdens" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70–73}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52–53}}

To maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The "hide" was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A "hide" is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The "hide" would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many "hides" he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70–73}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}

===Burghal system===
{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}

[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]

At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of [[burh]]s, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}

Alfred's burhs (later termed [[boroughs]]) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at Burpham, Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at [[Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary document now known as the [[Burghal Hidage]] provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the "hidage" for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a "hidage" of 2400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system-wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204–07}}

Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198–202}}
The burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as "[[herepath]]s"). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. The Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well-maintained army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892, and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}

Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for "the common needs of the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}

===English navy===
Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[Æthelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86–88}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}

Nevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305–07}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305–07}}

The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286–97}}

In the one recorded naval engagement in 896{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286–97}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286–97}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286–97}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}

==Legal reform==
{{Main|Doom book}}

[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]
In the late 880s or early 890s Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his "own" laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62–93}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many "[[synod]]-books" and "ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way".&lt;ref&gt;"Alfred" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he "found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and, although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280–81}}

About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the "Apostolic Letter" from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23–29). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}

Similarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the "Apostolic Letter" which explained that Christ "had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods "established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed".&lt;ref name=keynes&gt;"Alfred" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord "since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself".&lt;ref name=keynes/&gt; Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Matt. 22:39–40) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites "Alfred's Pastoral Care" ch. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

When one turns from the domboc's introduction to the laws themselves it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship "designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: "We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.&lt;ref&gt;"Alfred" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and "would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust".&lt;ref&gt;Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.&lt;ref&gt;The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544–546}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves "to the pursuit of wisdom". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.&lt;ref&gt;Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48–50}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48–50}}

==Foreign relations==
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[Pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean Asia as other versions say "Iudea".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190–92}}}} Around 890 [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}

Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain|Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim "Scots" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]], though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}

==Religion and culture==
[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]
In the 880s, at the same time that he was "cajoling and threatening" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. "King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey". Simon Keynes. Dorset County Council 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

This revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed "most necessary for all men to know";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28–29}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34–35}}

Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101–02}}

Alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78–79}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1–9}}

He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1–9}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}

===Impact of Danish raids on education===
The Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that "learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265–68}}

Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. "It is clear", Brooks concludes, "that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172–73}}

===Establishment of a court school===
Following the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and "a good many of lesser birth".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28–29}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and "devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts".&lt;ref&gt;Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90–91. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92–93}}

===Advocacy of education in the English language===
Alfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed "to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125–26}}

There were few "books of wisdom" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed "most necessary for all men to know".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125–26}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as "Alfredian" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Bately, 'Alfred as Author and Translator' in ''A Companion to Alfred the Great'', ed. by Nicole Guenther Discenza and Paul E. Szarmach (Leiden: Brill, 2014), pp. 113–42, {{doi|10.1163/9789004283763_006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''", [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].&lt;ref name="Bately"&gt;{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433–60}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.&lt;ref name="Bately"/&gt; Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33–34}}

The preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating "sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}

Boethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149–60}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: "To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works."{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; the writing is prose, in the other&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt "Boethius"}}

The last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'', i.e. "Blooms" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. "Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear."{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115–26}}

[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]
[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]
The [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN (Alfred ordered me to be made). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonné enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189–91}}

It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the "æstels"—pointers for reading—that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each "æstel" was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203–06}}

Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219–57}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124–45}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: "Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}

The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219–57}}

==Appearance and character==
[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]
[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser|Life of King Alfred]]'':
{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother—indeed, by everybody—with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74–75}} }}

It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as "shameful negligence" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest." After excitedly asking, "Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}

Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these "he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it."{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}

An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}

Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred "could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} 

==Family==
[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]
In 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[Æthelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240–41}}

They had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[Æthelflæd]] who became Lady (ruler) of the Mercians in her own right; and [[Ælfthryth, Countess of Flanders|Ælfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] the [[Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita Ælfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Cædwalla]]. In 2008, the skeleton of Queen [[Eadgyth]], granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] in Germany. It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her—one of the earliest members of the English royal family.{{sfn|Bristol University staff|2010}}

[[Osferth]] was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother, "mistakenly" according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60–62}}

==Death, burial and fate of remains==
[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred's will]]
Alfred died on 26 October 899.{{sfn|Blair|1977|page=80}} How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either [[Crohn's disease]] or [[hemorrhoids|haemorrhoidal disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303–05}}{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=58}} His grandson King [[Eadred]] seems to have suffered from a similar illness.{{sfn|Malmesbury|1904|p=145}}{{efn|According to St Dunstan's apprentice "...poor King Eadred would suck the juice out of the food, chew what remained for a little while and spit it out: a nasty practice that often turned the stomachs of the thegns who dined with him."{{sfn|Dunstan|1992|p=248}}}}

Alfred was originally buried temporarily in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] in [[Winchester]]. Four years after his death he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). When the New Minster moved to Hyde, a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}

The royal graves and many others were probably rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|The Church Monuments Society|2014}} Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.{{sfn|The Church Monuments Society|2014}}

Excavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}} The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones. Bones suggested at the time to be those of Alfred proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}}

In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester [[exhume]]d the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}}{{sfn|Cohen|2013}} The bones were [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore not of Alfred.

In January 2014, a fragment of [[pelvis]] unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, which had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], but this remains unproven.{{sfn|BBC staff|2014}}{{sfn|Keys|2014}}

Alfred commissioned Bishop Asser to write his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's positive aspects. Later medieval historians, such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the [[Reformation]] Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great' rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}

A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour. These include:
*The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former 'King Alfred's College, Winchester' (1928 to 2004).
*[[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]. The local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne.
*In honour of Alfred, the [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]].
[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]
*[[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred.
*King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]] is so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school.
*The King Alfred School &amp; Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge is so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney.
*The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK.
*King Alfred's Middle School, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Dorset]] [Now defunct after reorganisation]
*[[King's College, Taunton]], Somerset. (The king in question is King Alfred).
*King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]].
*Saxonwold Primary School in Gauteng, South Africa names one of its houses after King Alfred. The others being Bede, Caedmon, and Dunston.

The [[Royal Navy]] has named one ship and two [[shore establishment]]s [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour. In 2002, Alfred was ranked number 14 in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.{{sfn|Daily Mail staff|2002}}

'''Animal testing''', also known as '''animal experimentation''', '''animal research''' and '''''in vivo'' testing''', is the use of non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.&lt;ref name=selectcommintro&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a7 |title="Introduction", Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and [[Toxicology testing|toxicology]], including [[Testing cosmetics on animals|cosmetics testing]]. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.

It is estimated that the annual use of [[vertebrate]] animals—from [[zebrafish]] to non-human [[primates]]— ranges from tens to more than 100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Cohn (26 August 2010).

==Definitions==
The terms ''animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research'', ''[[in vivo]]'' testing, and [[vivisection]] have similar [[denotation]]s but different [[connotation]]s. Literally, "vivisection" means the "cutting up" of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the [[dissection]] of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals",&lt;ref name=croce&gt;Croce, Pietro (1999).

The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] in the 2nd and 4th centuries BC. [[Aristotle]] and [[Erasistratus]] were among the first to perform experiments on living animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen and Loew 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen]], a 2nd-century Roman physician, dissected pigs and goats; his is known as the "father of vivisection".&lt;ref name=lpag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpag.org/layperson/layperson.html#history |title=History of nonhuman animal research |publisher=Laboratory Primate Advocacy Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013110949/http://www.lpag.org/layperson/layperson.html |archivedate=13 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]], a 12th-century [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic physician]] in [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]] also practiced dissection; he introduced animal testing as an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients.&lt;ref name=Rabie2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abdel-Halim RE | title = Contributions of Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) to the progress of surgery: a study and translations from his book Al-Taisir | journal = Saudi Medical Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 1333–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16155644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabie2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abdel-Halim RE | title = Contributions of Muhadhdhab Al-Deen Al-Baghdadi to the progress of medicine and urology.

Animals have repeatedly been used through the history of biomedical research. In 1831, the founders of the [[Dublin Zoo]] were members of the medical profession who were interested in studying animals while they were alive and when they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, [[Louis Pasteur]] convincingly demonstrated the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] of medicine by inducing [[anthrax]] in sheep.&lt;ref name="pmid11544370"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mock M, Fouet A | title = Anthrax | journal = Annu.

[[Toxicology]] testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm |title=Taste of Raspberries, Taste of Death.

===Historical debate===
[[Image:Claude Bernard 5.jpg|left|thumb|[[Claude Bernard]], regarded as the "prince of vivisectors",&lt;ref name=Croce11/&gt; argued that experiments on animals are "entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man".&lt;ref name=Bernard&gt;[[Claude Bernard|Bernard, Claude]] ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'', 1865. First English translation by Henry Copley Greene, published by Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1927; reprinted in 1949, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of [[Galen]]ic physiology [[Edmund O'Meara]] said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state".&lt;ref name=Ryder54&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] (2000). ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''.

Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals.&lt;ref name=ANZCCART/&gt; Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle—many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.&lt;ref name=ANZCCART/&gt;

On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge.

In 1896, the physiologist and physician [[Walter Cannon|Dr. Walter B.

In 1822, the first [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|animal protection law]] was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|Cruelty to Animals Act (1876)]], the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote to [[Ray Lankester]] in March 1871: "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-and-Letters-of-Charles-Darwinx29407.html |title='&amp;#39;The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II'&amp;#39; |publisher=Fullbooks.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, John (1991).

Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when [[Henry Bergh]] founded the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Buettinger, Craig (1 January 1993) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080215121937/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13506650.html Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century.] ''The Historian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care and use of animals==
===Regulations and laws===
{{See also|Animal testing regulations|Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986}}
The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] and the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (the ''Guide''), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.&lt;ref name=Carbone68&gt;Carbone, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act do not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm#AnimalWelfareAssurance Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare].

Code of Federal Regulations. Vol. 1 (1 January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&amp;nbsp;The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates, rabbits, mice, and other animals, while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research.&lt;ref name="aldf.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aldf.org/resources/when-you-witness-animal-cruelty/animal-testing-and-the-law/?gclid=CJmh4vzmvdQCFUWCfgodqA8Hlg|title=Animal Testing and the Law - Animal Legal Defense Fund|website=Animal Legal Defense Fund|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823020847/http://aldf.org/resources/when-you-witness-animal-cruelty/animal-testing-and-the-law/?gclid=CJmh4vzmvdQCFUWCfgodqA8Hlg|archive-date=23 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.

According to the 2014 U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report—which looked at the oversight of animal use during a three-year period—"some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ...did not adequately approve, monitor, or report on experimental procedures on animals". The OIG found that "as a result, animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and, in some cases, pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures". According to the report, within a three-year period, nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harden|first1=Gil|title=USDA Inspector General Audit Report of APHIS Animal Care Program Inspection and Enforcement Activities|journal=United States Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General|issue=Report No. 33601–0001–41|url=http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/33601-0001-41.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA OIG made similar findings in a 2005 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 2005|title=Audit Report: APHIS Animal Care Program Inspection and Enforcement Activities|url=http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/33002-03-SF.pdf|journal=USDA Office of Inspector General Western Region|issue=Report No. 33002–3–SF|last1=Young|first1=Robert|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With only a broad number of 120 inspectors, the United States Department of Agriculture&amp;nbsp;(USDA) oversees more than 12,000 facilities involved in research, exhibition, breeding, or dealing of animals.&lt;ref name="aldf.org"/&gt; Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs, asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=L|last2=Goodman|first2=J|last3=Chandna|first3=A|title=Analysis of animal research ethics committee membership at American institutions|journal=Animals|date=2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=68–75|doi=10.3390/ani2010068|pmid=26486777|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/1/68|accessdate=7 July 2015|pmc=4494267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of [[non-human primates]] always raises what he calls a "red flag of special concern".&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''Science'' magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plous S, Herzog H | title = ANIMAL RESEARCH: Reliability of Protocol Reviews for Animal Research | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5530 | pages = 608–609 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11474086 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1061621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;USDA/APHIS&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;published the 2016 animal research statistics. Overall, the number of animals (covered by the Animal Welfare Act) used in research in the US&amp;nbsp;'''rose 6.9%'''&amp;nbsp;from 767,622 (2015) to 820,812 (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speakingofresearch.com/2017/06/19/usda-publishes-2016-animal-research-statistics-7-rise-in-animal-use/|title=USDA publishes 2016 animal research statistics – 7% rise in animal use|date=2017-06-19|work=Speaking of Research|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes both public and private institutions.By comparing with EU data, where all [[vertebrate]] species are counted, [[Speaking of Research]] estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016.&lt;ref name="USDA2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/statistics/|title=USDA Statistics for Animals Used in Research in the US|publisher=Speaking of Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 article published in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.&lt;ref name="GoodmanChandnaRoe" /&gt;

In 1995, researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals were used in American laboratories in 1992, a reduction from a high of 50 million used in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, A., Loew, F., and Weer, J. (1995) "The Animal Research Controversy. Protest, Process and Public Policy: An Analysis of Strategic Issues." ''Tufts University'', North Grafton. cited in Carbone 2004, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Alternatives to Animal Use in Research, Testing and Education'', U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, D.C.:Government Printing Office, 1986, p. 64. In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.&lt;ref name=USDA2016 /&gt;

In GB, Home Office figures show that 3.79 million procedures were carried out in 2017.&lt;ref name="UK Home Office 2016"&gt;{{cite web|date=2017|url=http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/communications-media/animal-research-numbers-in-2017/ |title=Animal research numbers in 2017 |publisher=Understanding Animal Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,960 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988. A "procedure" refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures.&lt;ref name=nuffield45/&gt;
The procedures conducted on animals in GB in 2017 were categorised as –
*43% (1.61 million) were assessed as sub-threshold
*4% (0.14 million) were assessed as non-recovery
*36% (1.35 million) were assessed as mild
*15% (0.55 million) were assessed as moderate
*4% (0.14 million) were assessed as severe&lt;ref name=SR2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/uk-statistics/ |title=Home Office Statistics for Animals Used in Research in the UK |publisher=Speaking of Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ‘severe’ procedure would be, for instance, any test where death is the end-point or fatalities are expected, whereas a ‘mild’ procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan.&lt;ref name="UK Home Office 2016" /&gt;

===The Three R's===
The Three R's (3R's) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing.  These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959.&lt;ref name="altweb.jhsph"&gt;Russell, W.M.S. and Burch, R.L., (1959).  ''The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique'', Methuen, London. {{ISBN|0-900767-78-2}} [http://altweb.jhsph.edu/pubs/books/humane_exp/het-toc]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3R's state: 
#Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling.&lt;ref name=Badyal&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Badyal D., Desai C. | year = 2014 | title = Animal use in pharmacology education and research: The changing scenario | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 257–265 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.132153 | pmid = 24987170 | pmc = 4071700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.
#Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include non-invasive techniques.&lt;ref name=Badyal/&gt;
The 3R's have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided.  These 3R's are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations.&lt;ref name="Ethical"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liguori, G.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2017 | title = Ethical Issues in the Use of Animal Models for Tissue Engineering: Reflections on Legal Aspects, Moral Theory, 3Rs Strategies, and Harm-Benefit Analysis| journal = Tissue Engineering Part C Methods | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages= 850–862 | doi=10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3R's, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, South Korea, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use.&lt;ref name="GoodmanChandnaRoe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=J. |last2=Chandna |first2=A. |last3=Roe |first3=K. |title=Trends in animal use at US research facilities |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=2015 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2014-102404 |pmid=25717142 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2015/01/27/medethics-2014-102404.abstract |accessdate=7 July 2015 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=567–569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Canadian Council on Animal Care |title=2009 CCAC Survey of Animal Use |date=December 2010 |url=http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Publications/Statistics/Survey_2009.pdf |accessdate=7 July 2015 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607174417/http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Publications/Statistics/Survey_2009.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merkes |first1=M. |last2=Buttrose |first2=R. |title=New code, same suffering: animals in the lab |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-01/merkes-and-buttrose-animal-testing/4857604 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |agency=The Drum |publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Even |first1=Dan |title=Number of animal experiments up for first time since 2008 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/number-of-animal-experiments-up-for-firsttime-since-2008.premium-1.526516 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |agency=Haaretz |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rise in animal research in South Korea in 2017 |date=20 April 2018 |url=https://speakingofresearch.com/2018/04/12/rise-in-animal-research-in-south-korea-in-2017/ |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Number of laboratory animals in Germany |url=http://www.mpg.de/286584/Numbers |website=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft |publisher=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kong |first1=Q. |last2=Qin |first2=C. |title=Analysis of current laboratory animal science policies and administration in China |journal=ILAR |date=2009 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=e1–e11  |pmid=20075493 |doi=10.1093/ilar.51.1.e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - front (aka).jpg|thumb|[[Drosophila melanogaster|Fruit flies]] are an invertebrate commonly used in animal testing.]]
Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a fruit fly, and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a [[nematode]] worm. In the case of ''C. elegans'', the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Antoshechkin I, Sternberg PW | title = The versatile worm: genetic and genomic resources for Caenorhabditis elegans research | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 518–32 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17549065 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while studies in the fly ''D. melanogaster'' can use an amazing array of genetic tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matthews KA, Kaufman TC, Gelbart WM | title = Research resources for Drosophila: the expanding universe | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 179–93 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15738962 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied.

Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education—particularly [[beagle]]s, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, [[endocrinology]], and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the [[Humane Society of the United States]].&lt;ref name=HSUSDogs&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080226113001/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/dog.html Dog profile], The Humane Society of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D|last2=Broadhead|first2=C|last3=Descotes|first3=G|last4=Fosse|first4=R|last5=Hack|first5=R|last6=Krauser|first6=K|last7=Pfister|first7=R|last8=Phillips|first8=B|last9=Rabemampianina|first9=Y|last10=Sanders|first10=J|last11=Sparrow|first11=S|last12=Stephan-Gueldner|first12=M|last13=Jacobsen|first13=SD|date=2002|title=Preclinical Safety Evaluation Using Nonrodent Species: An Industry/ Welfare Project to Minimize Dog Use|journal=ILAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, in accordance with the regulations set out in the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]].

[[Image:77-cm primate cage.jpg|thumb]]
Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of [[neurology]], behavior and cognition, reproduction, [[genetics]], and [[xenotransplantation]]. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10774&amp;page=R1 International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources], Proceedings of the Workshop Held 17–19 April, pages 36–45, 46–48, 63–69, 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Seventh Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union|journal=Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament|date=12 May 2013|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52013DC0859&amp;from=EN|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016.&lt;ref name=USDA2016 /&gt; 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. primate import statistics for 2014|url=http://www.ippl.org/gibbon/2015/01/|website=International Primate Protection League|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the NHPs used in experiments are [[macaque]]s;&lt;ref name="Humaneprimate"/&gt; but [[marmoset]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, and [[squirrel monkey]]s are also used, and [[baboon]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are used in the US.

In a survey in 2003, it was found that 89% of singly-housed primates exhibited self-injurious or [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal]] [[stereotypy]]ical behaviors including pacing, rocking, hair pulling, and biting among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=C|last2=Well|first2=A|last3=Novak|first3=M|title=Stereotypic and Self-Injurious Behavior in Rhesus Macaques: A Survey and Retrospective Analysis of Environment and Early Experience|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=2003|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1002/ajp.10075|pmid=12766938}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Laboratory animal sources|International primate trade}}
Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/comparative_medicine/resource_directory/invertebrates.asp Invertebrate Animal Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025061451/http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/comparative_medicine/resource_directory/invertebrates.asp |date=25 October 2007 }}. National Center for Research Resources. ncrr.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like [[Covance]] and [[Charles River Laboratories]] who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as [[Nafovanny]]; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads.

Four states in the U.S.—[[Minnesota]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Iowa]]—require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.&lt;ref name=ASPCAdealers&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080627163237/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=kids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom Animal Testing: Where Do the Animals Come From?].

According to the ASPCA, the following states prohibit shelters from providing animals for research: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, animal sources are governed by ''Council Directive 86/609/EEC'', which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement.&lt;ref name=direct1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:NOT |title=Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Directive was revised with [[EU Directive 2010/63/EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010L0063:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes Text with EEA relevance |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcites.gov.uk/pdf_files/Sep05GN9%20Primate%20imports.pdf Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731082707/http://www.ukcites.gov.uk/pdf_files/Sep05GN9%20Primate%20imports.pdf |date=31 July 2007 }} Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOStats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf |title="Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals", Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Home Office|year= 2004| page=87 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by [[Charles River Laboratories]], or by [[Covance]], which is the single largest [[International primate trade|importer of primates]] into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070708204056/http://www.ippl.org/04-25-07c.html U.S. Primate Imports Spike] ''International Primate Protection League'' April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain and suffering===

[[File:Frog vivisection.jpg|thumb|right|Prior to dissection for educational purposes, [[chloroform]] was administered to this [[Common Sand Frog|common sand frog]] to induce [[anesthesia]] and death.]]

The extent to which animal testing causes [[pain]] and [[suffering]], and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duncan IJ, Petherick JC | title = The implications of cognitive processes for animal welfare | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 5017–22 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1808195 | doi=10.2527/1991.69125017x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Curtis SE, Stricklin WR | title = The importance of animal cognition in agricultural animal production systems: an overview | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 5001–7 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1808193 | doi=10.2527/1991.69125001x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.&lt;ref name="USDA2016" /&gt;

Since 2014, in the UK, every research procedure was retrospectively assessed for severity. The five categories are "sub-threshold", "mild", "moderate", "severe" and "non-recovery", the latter being procedures in which an animal is [[Anesthesia|anesthetized]] and subsequently killed without recovering [[consciousness]]. In 2017, 43% (1.61 million) were assessed as sub-threshold, 4% (0.14 million) were assessed as non-recovery, 36% (1.35 million) were assessed as mild, 15% (0.55 million) were assessed as moderate and 4% (0.14 million) were assessed as severe.&lt;ref name=SR2017 /&gt;

The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, [[René Descartes]], who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name=nuffield45/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carbone149&gt;Carbone, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Rollin]] of [[Colorado State University]], the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals,&lt;ref&gt;Rollin drafted the 1985 Health Research Extension Act and an animal welfare amendment to the 1985 Food Security Act: see Rollin, Bernard. [http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n6/full/7400996.html "Animal research: a moral science. Talking Point on the use of animals in scientific research"], EMBO Reports 8, 6, 2007, pp. 521–525&lt;/ref&gt; writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin, Bernard. ''The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117–118, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" grounds for claiming that they feel pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117/&gt; Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffin DR, Speck GB | title = New evidence of animal consciousness | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14658059 | doi = 10.1007/s10071-003-0203-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined.&lt;ref name=nuffield45/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen C | title = Assessing animal cognition: ethological and philosophical perspectives | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9464883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some canine experts are stating that, while intelligence does differ animal to animal, dogs have the intelligence of a two to two-and-a-half year old. This does support the idea that dogs, at the very least, have some form of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association.

ScienceDaily, 10 August 2009. &lt;www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090810025241.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of invertebrates to experience pain and suffering is less clear, however, legislation in several countries (e.g. U.K., [[Regulation of animal research in New Zealand|New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0142/latest/DLM49664.html|title=Animal Welfare Act 1999|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|year=2015|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway&lt;ref name="Norway"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Norwegian animal welfare act|url=https://www.animallaw.info/statute/noway-cruelty-norwegian-animal-welfare-act-2010#s1|accessdate=25 January 2016|publisher=Michigan State University|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) protects some invertebrate species if they are being used in animal testing.

In the U.S., the defining text on animal welfare regulation in animal testing is the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5140 "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"], ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 64, {{ISBN|0-309-05377-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the U.S. It states "The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals." The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states "The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol". Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/ncstate/iacuc.htm|title=How to Work With Your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)|website=ori.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euthanasia===

Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments.&lt;ref name=Flecknell/&gt; However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the [[RSPCA]], argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apc.gov.uk/reference/costbenefit.pdf Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041442/http://www.apc.gov.uk/reference/costbenefit.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }} The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause [[pain]] and [[suffering]], not whether their death is undesirable in itself.&lt;ref name=Carbone2&gt;Carbone, Larry.

Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5140 "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"], ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-309-05377-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. [[Sedative]]s or [[anesthetic]]s such as [[barbiturate]]s can be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as [[tricaine]]. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include [[decapitation]] (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. [[Cervical dislocation]] (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. [[Maceration (food)|Maceration]] (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} High-intensity microwave [[irradiation]] of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. [[Captive bolt]]s may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious.

===Pure research===
Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear.&lt;ref name=Lords3&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm "Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report"], House of Lords, 16 July 2002. See chapter 3: "The purpose and nature of animal experiments." Retrieved 6 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from [[California sea slug|sea slugs]] through to [[armadillo]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Job CK | title = Nine-banded armadillo and leprosy research | journal = Indian Journal of Pathology &amp; Microbiology | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–50 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15025339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:
*Studies on ''[[embryogenesis]]'' and ''[[developmental biology]]''. Mutants are created by adding [[transposon]]s into their [[genome]]s, or specific genes are deleted by [[gene targeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Venken KJ, Bellen HJ | title = Emerging technologies for gene manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–78 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15738961 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sung YH, Song J, Lee HW | title = Functional genomics approach using mice | journal = Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 122–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14761310 | doi = 10.5483/BMBRep.2004.37.1.122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process.

Retrieved 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breeding experiments to study ''[[evolution]]'' and ''[[genetics]]''. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are [[Inbreeding|inbred]] through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Festing|Festing, M.]], ''[http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/festing/mouse/INTRO.shtml "Inbred Strains of Mice and their Characteristics"],'' ''[[The Jackson Laboratory]] ''. Retrieved 30 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These provide animals of a known genetic background, an important tool for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of [[Selective breeding|inbred domesticated animals]], such as dog or cattle breeds, for [[Comparative genomics|comparative]] purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their [[ecological niche|niche]]) produce [[adaptation]]s in their physiology and [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]]. As an example, [[stickleback]]s are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peichel CL | title = Fishing for the secrets of vertebrate evolution in threespine sticklebacks | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 234 | issue = 4 | pages = 815–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16252286 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.20564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peichel CL, Nereng KS, Ohgi KA, Cole BL, Colosimo PF, Buerkle CA, Schluter D, Kingsley DM | title = The genetic architecture of divergence between threespine stickleback species | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6866 | pages = 901–5 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11780061 | doi = 10.1038/414901a | bibcode = 2001Natur.414..901P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied research===
Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. These may involve the use of [[animal model]]s of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the [[drug discovery]] process. Examples include:

*[[Genetic modification]] of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as [[single gene disorders]], such as [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramaswamy S, McBride JL, Kordower JH | title = Animal models of Huntington's disease | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–73 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17712222 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.48.4.356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rees DA, Alcolado JC | title = Animal models of diabetes mellitus | journal = Diabetic Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 359–70 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15787657 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01499.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iwakuma T, Lozano G | title = Crippling p53 activities via knock-in mutations in mouse models | journal = Oncogene | volume = 26 | issue = 15 | pages = 2177–84 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17401426 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1210278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frese KK, Tuveson DA | title = Maximizing mouse cancer models | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 645–58 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17687385 | doi = 10.1038/nrc2192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal/&gt; Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.&lt;ref name=HOStats/&gt;
*Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study [[leukemia]] because their natural predisposition to [[FIV]] and [[Feline leukemia virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dunham SP | title = Lessons from the cat: development of vaccines against lentiviruses | journal = Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology | volume = 112 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 67–77 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16678276 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.03.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vail DM, MacEwen EG | title = Spontaneously occurring tumors of companion animals as models for human cancer | journal = Cancer Investigation | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 781–92 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11107448 | doi = 10.3109/07357900009012210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain breeds of dog suffer from [[narcolepsy]] making them the major model used to study the human condition. [[Armadillo]]s and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from [[leprosy]]; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of [[bacilli]] used in leprosy vaccines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops [[pathology]] and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce [[stroke]], or giving [[neurotoxin]]s that cause damage similar to that seen in [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name=Tolwani/&gt; Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pound P, Ebrahim S, Sandercock P, Bracken MB, Roberts I | title = Where is the evidence that animal research benefits humans? | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7438 | pages = 514–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14988196 | pmc = 351856 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7438.514 | others = Reviewing Animal Trials Systematically (RATS) Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection|BUAV]] argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, Gill (2006) [http://www.buav.org/downloads/pdf/BUAV_Report-Next_of_Kin.pdf ''next of kin...A report on the use of primates in experiments''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041454/http://www.buav.org/downloads/pdf/BUAV_Report-Next_of_Kin.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}, BUAV.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity ''The Parkinson's Appeal'', state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as [[pallidotomy]], new drug treatments such as [[levodopa]], and later [[deep brain stimulation]].&lt;ref name=Emborg&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emborg ME | title = Nonhuman primate models of Parkinson's disease | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–55 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17712221 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.48.4.339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tolwani&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolwani RJ, Jakowec MW, Petzinger GM, Green S, Waggie K | title = Experimental models of Parkinson's disease: insights from many models | journal = Laboratory Animal Science | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10480640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parkinsonsappeal.com/pdfs/The%20History%20of%20Deep%20Brain%20Stimulation.pdf The History of Deep Brain Stimulation]. parkinsonsappeal.com&lt;/ref&gt;
*Animal testing has also included the use of [[placebo]] testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.

====Xenotransplantation====
{{Main|Xenotransplantation}}
[[Xenotransplantation]] research involves transplanting tissues or organs from one species to another, as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in [[organ transplant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Platt JL, Lin SS | title = The future promises of xenotransplantation | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 862 | pages = 5–18 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9928201 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09112.x | bibcode = 1998NYASA.862....5P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' [[immune system|immune response]] against the pig tissue.&lt;ref name=Schuurman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuurman HJ, Pierson RN | title = Progress towards clinical xenotransplantation | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 13 | issue = 13 | pages = 204–20 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17981539 | doi = 10.2741/2671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[transplant rejection]] remains a problem,&lt;ref name=Schuurman/&gt; recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valdés-González RA, Dorantes LM, Garibay GN, Bracho-Blanchet E, Mendez AJ, Dávila-Pérez R, Elliott RB, Terán L, White DJ | title = Xenotransplantation of porcine neonatal islets of Langerhans and Sertoli cells: a 4-year study | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–27 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16131605 | doi = 10.1530/eje.1.01982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valdés-González RA, White DJ, Dorantes LM, Terán L, Garibay-Nieto GN, Bracho-Blanchet E, Dávila-Pérez R, Evia-Viscarra L, Ormsby CE, Ayala-Sumuano JT, Silva-Torres ML, Ramírez-González B | title = Three-yr follow-up of a type 1 diabetes mellitus patient with an islet xenotransplant | journal = Clinical Transplantation | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17488384 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00648.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization [[Uncaged Campaigns]] showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of [[Novartis]] Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered serious and sometimes fatal injuries.

===Toxicology testing===
{{Main|Toxicology testing}}
{{Further|Draize test|LD50|Acute toxicity|Chronic toxicity|Genetically modified food controversies#Animal feeding studies}}

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], on behalf of a wide variety of customers.&lt;ref name=BUAVHPT&gt;[http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf Household Product Tests] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041444/http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }} [[BUAV]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.&lt;ref name=EU2005&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216072132/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union], ''Commission of the European Communities'', published November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Nature'', 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abbott A |title=Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7065 |pages=144–146 |year=2005 |pmid=16281001 |doi=10.1038/438144a |url=http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |bibcode=2005Natur.438..144A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041442/http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests are conducted without [[anesthesia]], because [[drug interaction|interactions between drugs]] can affect how animals [[xenobiotic metabolism|detoxify]] chemicals, and may interfere with the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Watkins JB | title = Exposure of rats to inhalational anesthetics alters the hepatobiliary clearance of cholephilic xenobiotics | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 250 | issue = 2 | pages = 421–7 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2760837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watt JA, Dickinson RG | title = The effect of diethyl ether, pentobarbitone and urethane anaesthesia on diflunisal conjugation and disposition in rats | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–301 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2336839 | doi = 10.3109/00498259009046848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[food additives]], packing materials, and [[air freshener]], or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to [[BUAV]], manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.&lt;ref name=BUAVHPT/&gt;

The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are several different types of [[acute toxicity]] tests. The {{LD50}} ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal [[Statistical population|population]]. This test was removed from [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the [[Fixed Dose Procedure|fixed dose procedure]], which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walum E | title = Acute oral toxicity | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 106 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 497–503 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9599698 | pmc = 1533392 | doi = 10.2307/3433801 | jstor = 3433801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081119080934/http://hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/intergovernmental_organization_eliminates_the_ld50_test.html Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test], The Humane Society of the United States (2003-02-05)&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott writes that, as of 2005, "the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide".&lt;ref name=Abbott/&gt;

Irritancy can be measured using the [[Draize test]], where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows "continuing signs of severe pain or distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/9740501E.PDF |format=PDF |title=OECD guideline 405, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2015-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041440/http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/9740501E.PDF |archivedate=27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060123/http://hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/rabbit.html Species Used in Research: Rabbit], Humane Society of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilhelmus KR | title = The Draize eye test | journal = Survey of Ophthalmology | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 493–515 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11425356 | doi = 10.1016/S0039-6257(01)00211-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no accepted ''in vitro'' alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the ''low volume eye test'' may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Secchi A, Deligianni V | title = Ocular toxicology: the Draize eye test | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16954791 | doi = 10.1097/01.all.0000244798.26110.00 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadwen&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327195524/http://www.drhadwentrust.org/news/rabbit-eye-test-replacement Draize rabbit eye test replacement milestone welcomed]. ''Dr Hadwen Trust'' (2009-09-21)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.&lt;ref name=Hadwen/&gt;

The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, [[mutagen]]icity, [[carcinogen]]icity, [[teratogen]]icity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.

These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] report, "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential".&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11523&amp;page=R1 Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents"] National Academies Press, (2006), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal tests may overestimate risk, with [[false positive]] results being a particular problem,&lt;ref name=Abbott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hartung T | title = Toxicology for the twenty-first century | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7252 | pages = 208–12 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19587762 | doi = 10.1038/460208a | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..208H }}&lt;/ref&gt; but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://protestitalia.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/where-is-the-toxicology-for-the-twenty-first-century/ |title= Where is the toxicology for the twenty-first century? |year= 2013 |website= |publisher= Pro-Test Italia |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith LL | title = Key challenges for toxicologists in the 21st century | journal = Trends Pharmacol.

===Drug testing===
Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:
*''metabolic tests'', investigating [[pharmacokinetics]]—how drugs are absorbed, [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] and [[Excretion|excreted]] by the body when introduced [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]], [[intravenous]]ly, intraperitoneally, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]].
*''toxicology tests'', which gauge [[acute toxicity|acute]], sub-acute, and [[chronic toxicity]]. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that "acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species" covering "at least two different routes of administration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 44 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic [[drug metabolism|drug metabolites]] build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 45 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''efficacy studies'', which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a [[Randomized controlled trial|double-blind controlled trial]], which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the [[Dose response|dose-response]] curve.
*Specific tests on ''reproductive function'', ''embryonic toxicity'', or ''carcinogenic potential'' can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.

===Education===
It is estimated that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, dissections and live-animal surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patronek|first1=G|last2=Rauch|first2=A|title=Systematic review of comparative studies examining alternatives to the harmful use of animals in biomedical education|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 January 2007|volume=230|issue=1|pages=37–43|doi=10.2460/javma.230.1.37|pmid=17199490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=L|last2=Hart|first2=B|last3=Wood|first3=M|title=Why Dissection: Animal Use in Education|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|isbn=978-0-313-32390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orlans|first1=Barbara|last2=Beauchamp|first2=Tom|last3=Dresser|first3=Rebecca|last4=Morton|first4=David|last5=Gluck|first5=John|title=The Human Use of Animals|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-511908-8|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives to the use of animals in classroom dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downey|first1=Maureen|title=Should students dissect animals or should schools move to virtual dissections?|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/get-schooled/2013/jun/25/should-students-dissect-animals-or-should-schools-/|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=Atlanta Journal Constitution|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned dissections in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pulla|first1=Priyanka|title=Dissections banned in Indian universities|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asiapacific/2014/08/dissections-banned-indian-universities|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=Science|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shine|first1=Nicole|title=The Battle Over High School Animal Dissection|url=https://psmag.com/environment/battle-high-school-animal-dissection-92391|website=Pacific Standard|publisher=Pacific Standard|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the U.S.-based company Backyard Brains released for sale to the public what they call the "Roboroach", an "electronic backpack" that can be attached to [[cockroach]]es.

A [[Mobile app|mobile phone app]] can then be used to control it via [[Bluetooth]].&lt;ref name="BBC 09-11-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24455141|title=Row over US mobile phone 'cockroach backpack' appp|publisher=BBC News|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science. The makers of the "Roboroach" have been funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="BBC 09-11-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 01-11-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/01/cyborg-cockroaches-are-coming-but-not-if-peta-has-anything-to-say-about-it/|title=Resistance is Futile: PETA Attempts to Halt the Sale of Remote-Controlled Cyborg Cockroaches|work=Time|date=1 November 2013|author =Hamilton, Anita|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense===
Animals are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing.&lt;ref name=Lords3/&gt; For example, in 2008 the United States [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] used live pigs to study the effects of [[improvised explosive device]] explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Tom Vanden, "[https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20090407/1apigs07_st.art.htm Brain Study, Animal Rights Collide]", ''[[USA Today]]'' (7 April 2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US military, [[goat]]s are commonly used to train [[combat medic]]s. (Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=kelly2013&gt;{{Cite news

The moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rollin BE | title = The regulation of animal research and the emergence of animal ethics: A conceptual history | journal = Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 285–304 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16937023 | doi = 10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species.

A 2015 Gallup poll found that 67% of Americans were "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" about animals used in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=In U.S., More Say Animals Should Have Same Rights as People|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=Gallup|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew poll taken the same year found 50% of American adults opposed the use of animals in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Rainie|first2=Lee|title=Public and Scientists’ Views on Science and Society|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=Pew Research Center|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, a wide range of viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights ([[animal rights]]) is a philosophical position proposed by [[Tom Regan]], among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the "subjects of a life" with moral value and therefore moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter (ed.). "A Companion to Ethics". Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a "moral dilemma" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.&lt;ref name=Nuffield&gt;[http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/Animals%20Chapter%2014%20Discussion%20of%20Ethical%20Issues.pdf Page 244, Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072631/http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/Animals%20Chapter%2014%20Discussion%20of%20Ethical%20Issues.pdf |date=28 September 2011 }} in: [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/animal-research The ethics of research involving animals] at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist view in animal rights]] holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal.&lt;ref name=Nuffield/&gt; [[Bernard Rollin]] argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher [[Peter Singer]], who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral considerations.&lt;ref name=Rollin1998&gt;Rollin, Bernard E.

Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of [[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], a macaque monkey at the [[University of California, Riverside]], gained public attention.

In 2006, a primate researcher at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists.

These attacks—as well as similar incidents that caused the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had "clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme"—prompted the US government to pass the [[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]] and the UK government to add the offense of "Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation" to the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]]. Such legislation and the arrest and imprisonment of activists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Ian (27 January 2007).

==Alternatives to animal testing==
{{Main|Alternatives to animal testing}}
Most scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. [[The Three Rs (animals)|The "Three Rs"]]&lt;ref name="altweb.jhsph" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flecknell&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flecknell P | title = Replacement, reduction and refinement | journal = ALTEX | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12098013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are guiding [[Moral obligation|principles]] for the use of animals in research in most countries.  Whilst replacement of animals, i.e. alternatives to animal testing, is one of the principles, their scope is much broader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=7 |title=What are the 3Rs? |publisher=NC3Rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kolar R | title = ECVAM: desperately needed or superfluous? An animal welfare perspective | journal = Altern Lab Anim | volume = 30 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 169–74 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12513669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuppli CA, Fraser D, McDonald M | title = Expanding the three Rs to meet new challenges in humane animal experimentation | journal = Altern Lab Anim | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 525–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15656775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rusche B | title = The 3Rs and animal welfare – conflict or the way forward? | journal = ALTEX | volume = 20 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 63–76 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14671703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists and engineers at Harvard's [[Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering|Wyss Institute]] have created "organs-on-a-chip", including the "lung-on-a-chip" and "gut-on-a-chip". These tiny devices contain human cells in a 3-dimensional system that mimics human organs. The chips can be used instead of animals in ''[[in vitro]]'' disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =&lt;!-- Content Area Start --&gt; Alternatives to Animal Testing |url=http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/alternatives-to-animal-testing.aspx |title=Alternatives to Animal Testing &amp;#124; Animals Used for Experimentation &amp;#124; The Issues |publisher=Peta.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also begun using 3-D bioprinters to create human tissues for ''in vitro'' testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhodes|first1=Margaret|title=Inside L’Oreal’s Plan to 3-D Print Human Skin|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/inside-loreals-plan-3-d-print-human-skin/|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=Wired|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another non-animal research method is ''[[in silico]]'' or computer simulation and mathematical modeling which seeks to investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with the ultimate goal of creating treatments unique to each patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Geoff|title=Alternatives to animal experimentation|journal=BMJ|date=27 January 2007|volume=334|issue=7586|pages=182–184|doi=10.1136/bmj.39058.469491.68|pmid=17255608|pmc=1782004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edelman|first1=L|last2=Eddy|first2=J|last3=Price|first3=N|title=In silico models of cancer|journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med|date=July–August 2010|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1002/wsbm.75|pmid=20836040|pmc=3157287|pages=438–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microdosing]] is another alternative to the use of animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microdosing|url=http://3rs.ccac.ca/en/research/refinement/microdosing.html|website=3Rs|publisher=Canadian Council on Animal Care in Science|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional alternative methods include [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), which allows scanning of the [[human brain]] ''in vivo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154877.php |title=What Is A PET Scan?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">'''Antoine Berman''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛʁman|lang}}; 24 June 1942 – 1991) was a [[France|French]] [[translation|translator]], [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[theorist]] of translation.

== Life ==
Antoine Berman was born in the small town of [[Argenton-sur-Creuse]], near Limoges, to a Polish-Jewish father and a French-Yugoslav mother. After living hidden during the Second World War, the family established near Paris. Berman attended the Lycée Montmorency. Later he studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris]], where he met his wife Isabelle. In 1968 they moved to Argentina, where they remained 5 years. Back in Paris he led a rich academic life. He died in 1991, at the age of only forty-nine, writing his last book in bed.

== Work ==
Antoine Berman's "trials of the foreign", which originates from German Romanticism (especially [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]), tries to show the "deforming tendencies" inherent in the act of translation.

Berman's 'twelve deforming tendencies' in translation were:
*Rationalisation
*Clarification 
*Expansion 
*Ennoblement
*Qualitative impoverishment
*Quantitative impoverishment
*The destruction of rhythms
*The destruction of underlying networks of signification
*The destruction of linguistic patternings
*The destruction of vernacular network or their exoticisation
*The destruction of expressions and idioms
*The effacement of the superimposition of languages

[[Lawrence Venuti]], an American translation theorist, has used Berman's concepts to write a genealogy of translation in an Anglo-American context to introduce the "foreignizing" strategy that is normatively suppressed in mainstream translation.

==Influence==
Berman was active in philosophical and literary circles, nevertheless he has been influential in [[translatology]], especially in [[translation criticism]]. He claimed that there may be many different methods for translation criticism as there are many translation theories; therefore he entitled a model of his own as an analytical path, which can be modulated according to the specific objectives of each analyst and adapted to all standardized text types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/258112/EVALUATION_OF_THE_TRANSLATION_OF_VIRGINIA_WOOLFS_THE_DUCHESS_AND_THE_JEWELER_BY_ALEV_BULUT|title=Berman's approach to translation criticism in a given example|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arne Dekke Eide Næss''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|n|ə|_|ˈ|n|ɛ|s}} {{respell|AR|nə|_|NESS}}; {{IPA-no|ˈnɛsː|lang}}; 27 January 1912 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2009) was a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term "[[deep ecology]]" and was an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C. |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–30 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss cited [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology.  Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian [[nonviolence]] and on several occasions participated in [[direct action]].

Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early [[post-war]] period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Naess believed that the [[environmental crisis]] of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.&lt;ref name="luke"/&gt;

He thereby distinguished between what he called ''deep'' and ''shallow'' ecological thinking. In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments, he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of [[biological diversity]], understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world.&lt;ref name="luke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy W. |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization &amp; Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Næss was born in Slemdal, Oslo, Norway, the son of Christine (Dekke) and Ragnar Eide Næss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boslekt.com/html/fam291xx/fam29101.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the [[University of Oslo]] and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a noted mountaineer, who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of [[Tirich Mir]] (7,708&amp;nbsp;m). The Tvergastein hut in the [[Hallingskarvet]] massif played an important role in Ecosophy T, as "T" is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Naess 1989, ''Ecology Community and Lifestyle'', (trans) David Rothenberg, CUP, Cambridge, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy ''[[Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy|Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arnenass28aug2003.jpg|thumb|Professor Arne Næss campaigning for the Norwegian Green party in 2003]]
In 1970, together with a large number of protesters, he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped. Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built, the demonstration launched a  more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seed, J. Macy, P. Flemming, A. Naess, ''Thinking like a mountain: towards a council of all beings'', Heritic Books (1988), {{ISBN|0-946097-26-7}}, {{ISBN|0-86571-133-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he won the [[Swedish Academy Nordic Prize]], known as the 'little Nobel'. In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] for socially useful work. Næss was a minor political candidate for the [[Miljøpartiet De Grønne|Norwegian Green Party]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/01/10/stortingsvalg/tab-2005-10-27-18.html |title=Storting Election 2005.

==Philosophy==
Næss' ''[[Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten]]'' (1936) anticipated many themes familiar in post-war analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hannay, Alastair |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=627 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss' main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled "Interpretation and Preciseness". This was an application of [[set theory]] to the problems of language interpretation, extending the work of semanticists such as [[Charles Kay Ogden]] in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''. A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance (word, phrase, or sentence) can be considered as having different potential interpretations, depending on prevailing language norms, the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users, and the language situation in which the utterance occurred. These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance. Each subset can, in its turn, have further subsets (theoretically ad infinitum). The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various. It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation, making possible evaluation of which are the more and less "reasonable interpretations". It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness, undue generalisation, conflation, pseudo-agreement and effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eriksson |first=Darek |title=Phenomeno-semantic complexity: A proposal for an alternative notion of complexity as a foundation for the management of complexity in human affairs |journal=Complexity and Organization |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Næss developed a simplified, practical textbook embodying these advantages, entitled ''Communication and Argument'', which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or "language logic", and was used over many decades as a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for the preparatory examination at the [[University of Oslo]], later known as "Examen Philosophicum" ("Exphil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal= Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=528 |doi=10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendations for public debate===
''Communication and Argument'' included his recommendations for objective public debate.  Næss argued for adhering to the following rules to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible:
# '''Avoid tendentious irrelevance'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.
# '''Avoid tendentious quoting'''&lt;br&gt;Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.
# '''Avoid tendentious ambiguity'''&lt;br&gt;Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.
# '''Avoid tendentious use of [[Straw man|straw men]]'''&lt;br&gt;Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.
# '''Avoid tendentious statements of fact'''&lt;br&gt;Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.
# '''Avoid tendentious tone of presentation'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=529 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many years these points were part of two compulsory courses in [[philosophy]] taught in Norwegian universities ("Examen philosophicum" and "Examen facultatum").

===Ecosophy T===
'''Ecosophy T''', as distinct from deep ecology, was originally the name of his personal philosophy. Others such as [[Warwick Fox]] have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to [[ecosophy]] T, Næss's personal beliefs. The T referred to Tvergastein, a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books, and reflected Næss's view that everyone should develop his own philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, Graham Purchase, Brian Morris, Rodney Aitchtey, Robert Hart, Chris Wilbert, ''Deep Ecology and Anarchism'', Freedom Press (1993) {{ISBN|0-900384-67-0}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a very rich and complex philosophy, Næss's [[ecosophy]] can be summed up as having Self-realization as its core. According to Næss, every being, whether [[human]], [[animal]], or [[vegetable]] has an equal right to live and to blossom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Næss |first=Arne |title=Ecology, community and lifestyle |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1989}} pp. 164-65&lt;/ref&gt; Through this capitalized Self, Næss emphasizes, in distinction to realization of man’s narrow selves, the realization of our selves as part of an [[Earth's spheres|ecospheric]] whole. It is in this whole that our true ecological Self can be realized. Practically Self-realization for Næss means that, if one does not know how the outcomes of one's actions will affect other beings, one should not act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization and Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15|issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[harm principle]].

==Family==
Næss' father, Ragnar Næss, was a successful banker and Næss was the younger brother of shipowner [[Erling Dekke Næss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Philosopher and Mountaineer |newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, QC) |date=Jan 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss himself was a married father of two and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman [[Arne Næss Jr.]] (1937–2004), who was once married to [[Diana Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Thinker behind 'deep ecology' dies |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen (Ottawa, ON) |date=Jan 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
The '''Arne Næss Centre of Ecology and Philosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''ANCEP'''), located in [[Norway]], is an organization focused on the philosophical heritage of Arne Næss. It was founded in 1998 as an educational organisation aimed at Norwegian students. ANCEP then worked to spread knowledge and understanding of [[ecology]], [[philosophy]] and [[non-violence]]. In 2003 ANCEP changed its name to Gateway College.

ANCEP was reestablished in June 2011 as a non-profit organization by Sjur Paulsen, Geir Grønflaten and Reidar Goffeng. With support from [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], [[Arts Council Norway]], Center for Development and Environment / [[Centre for Development and the Environment|SUM]] and the Norwegian School of Sport Science / [[Norges Idrettshøgskole]], ANCEP is now working on its first project called (Electronic Library). This project will gather all written, unpublished material by Næss to be scanned and preserved, then to be made  available for the general public as an online based digital library.

'''Augustin Berque''' (born 1942 in [[Rabat]], Morocco), is a French geographer, Orientalist and philosopher. He is the son of the famous Egyptologist [[Jacques Berque]]. He is professor at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] in [[Paris]] ([[EHESS]]). His specialist field of interest is Japan.

== Concepts ==

Berque has developed an extensive array of concepts in order to grasp the complex nature of relations between natural and physical objects and the way we conceive of nature. He insists on intermediation, introducing a new concept ([[Médiance]] in French). His more theoretical work relies on the concept of [[Ecumene|oecumene]], which he uses after [[Plato]] and quite distinctly from the sense proposed by [[Derrida]]. He has also worked on [[landscapes]] by comparing the different visions of the world that are mirrored by a specific landscape.

== Major works ==

Augustin Berque's work has not been widely translated into English.

'''Casuistry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|zj|u|ᵻ|s|t|r|i}}) is a process of reasoning that seeks to resolve moral problems by extracting or extending theoretical rules from a particular case, and reapplying those rules to new instances. This method occurs in [[applied ethics]] and [[jurisprudence]]. The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions (as in [[sophistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 |title=Casuistry |website=Dictionary of the History of Ideas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618095059/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 |archive-date=18 June 2006 |publisher=[[University of Virginia Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casuistry describes either a form of reasoning that is presumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be acceptable, or a form of reasoning that is inherently unsound and deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runes|first=Dagobert D.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/c.html|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy Pages|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c.htm#casu|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy-Dictionary.org|url=http://www.philosophy-dictionary.org/casuistry|work=casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says that the word "[o]ften (and perhaps originally) applied to a quibbling or evasive way of dealing with difficult cases of duty." Its textual references, except for certain technical usages, are consistently pejorative (e.g., "Casuistry destroys by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/28642|article=Casuistry |accessdate=21 September 2017}}, quoting {{cite book |first=Viscount |last=Bolingbroke |title=Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism and on the Idea of a Patriot King |location=London |year=1749 |url=https://archive.org/stream/lettersonspirit01boligoog#page/n175/mode/2up |p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''casuistry'' derives from the [[Latin]] noun ''casus'' ("case" or "occurrence").

==Examples==
While a principle-based approach might claim that [[lie|lying]] is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, depending upon the details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal [[testimony]] under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. ([[Thomas Sanchez]] and others thus theorized a [[doctrine of mental reservation]], which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.

Typically, casuistic reasoning begins with a clear-cut [[paradigm]]atic case. In legal reasoning, for example, this might be a [[precedent]] case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case ''like'' the paradigmatic case.

==Meanings==
Casuistry is a ''method'' of case reasoning especially useful in treating cases that involve moral dilemmas. It is a branch of [[applied ethics]]. It is also criticized for the use of inconsistent—or outright specious—application of rule to instance. 

==Morality==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

Casuistry takes a relentlessly practical approach to morality. Rather than using theories as starting points, casuistry begins with an examination of cases. By drawing parallels between [[paradigm]]s, or so-called "pure cases", and the case at hand, a casuist tries to determine a moral response appropriate to a particular case.

Casuistry has been described as "theory modest" (Arras, see below). One of the strengths of casuistry is that it does not begin with, nor does it overemphasize, theoretical issues. It does not require practitioners to agree about ethical theories or evaluations before making policy. Instead, they can agree that certain [[paradigm]]s should be treated in certain ways, and then agree on the similarities, the so-called warrants between a paradigm and the case at hand.

Since most people, and most cultures, substantially agree about most pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade people of different ethnic, religious and philosophical beliefs to treat particular cases in the same ways. For this reason, casuistry is widely considered to be the basis for the [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and its derivatives.

Casuistry is prone to abuses wherever the analogies between cases [[False analogy|are false]].

==History==
Casuistry dates from [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), yet the zenith of casuistry was from 1550 to 1650, when the [[Society of Jesus]] used case-based reasoning, particularly in administering the [[Sacrament of Penance]] (or "confession").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Franklin |title=The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2001 |pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''casuistry'' quickly became pejorative with [[Blaise Pascal]]'s attack on the misuse of casuistry. In ''[[Provincial Letters]]'' (1656–7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Blaise |last=Pascal |title=The Provincial Letters of Blaise Pascal |others=M'Crie, Thomas (trans.) |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |year=1898 |origyear=1657 |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/ |series=eBooks@Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; he scolded the Jesuits for using casuistic reasoning in confession to placate wealthy Church donors, while punishing poor penitents. Pascal charged that aristocratic penitents could confess their sins one day, re-commit the sin the next day, generously donate the following day, then return to re-confess their sins and only receive the lightest punishment; Pascal's criticisms darkened casuistry's reputation.

It was not until publication of ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'' (1988), by Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley, U. California Press (1990, {{ISBN|0-520-06960-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; that a revival of casuistry occurred. They argue that the abuse of casuistry is the problem, not casuistry ''per se'' (itself an example of casuistic reasoning). Properly used, casuistry is powerful reasoning. Jonsen and Toulmin offer casuistry in dissolving the contradictory tenets of [[moral absolutism]] and the common secular [[moral relativism]]: "the form of reasoning constitutive of classical casuistry is [[rhetorical reason]]ing".&lt;ref&gt;Jonsen, 1991, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the ethical philosophies of [[Utilitarianism]] (especially [[preference utilitarianism]]) and [[Pragmatism]] commonly are identified as greatly employing casuistic reasoning.

==Early modern times==
The casuistic method was popular among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period, and not only among the [[Jesuits]], as it is commonly thought. Famous casuistic authors include [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza]], whose ''Summula casuum conscientiae'' (1627) enjoyed a great success, [[Thomas Sanchez]], [[Vincenzo Filliucci]] (Jesuit and [[Apostolic Penitentiary|penitentiary]] at [[St Peter]]'s), [[Antonino Diana]], [[Paul Laymann]] (''Theologia Moralis'', 1625), [[John Azor]] (''Institutiones Morales'', 1600), [[Etienne Bauny]], [[Louis Cellot]], [[Valerius Reginaldus]], [[Hermann Busembaum]] (d. 1668), etc. One of the main theses of casuists was the necessity to adapt the rigorous morals of the [[Church Fathers|Early Fathers]] of [[Christianity]] to modern morals, which led in some extreme cases to justify what [[Innocent XI]] later called "laxist moral" (i.e. justification of [[usury]], [[homicide]], [[regicide]], [[lie|lying]] through "[[Doctrine of mental reservation|mental reservation]]", [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality|adultery and loss of virginity before marriage]], etc.—all due cases registered by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in the ''[[Provincial Letters]]'').

The progress of casuistry was interrupted toward the middle of the 17th century by the controversy which arose concerning the [[Catholic probabilism|doctrine of probabilism]], which stipulated that one could choose to follow a "probable opinion", that is, supported by a theologian or another, even if it contradicted a more probable opinion or a quotation from one of the [[Fathers of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', p. 74–6, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy divided Catholic theologians into two camps, Rigorists and Laxists.

Certain kinds of casuistry were criticized by early [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant theologians]], because it was used in order to justify many of the abuses that they sought to reform. It was famously attacked by the Catholic and [[Jansenist]] philosopher [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], during the [[formulary controversy]] against the Jesuits, in his [[Lettres provinciales|Provincial Letters]] as the use of [[rhetorics]] to justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with [[Jesuitism]]; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and [[sophist]]ic reasoning to justify moral laxity.&lt;ref&gt;170 "Casuistry..destroys, by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong." Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, ''Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism 1736'' (pub. 1749), quoted in Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century, "casuistry" had become a synonym for specious moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsen, Albert R., The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning, University of California Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-52-006063-6}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Puritan_casuistry|Puritans]] were well known for their own development of casuistry.

In 1679 [[Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;XI]] publicly condemned sixty-five of the more radical propositions (''stricti mentalis''), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, [[Francisco Suarez|Suarez]] and other casuists as ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum'' and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D., The Oxford History of the Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-19-282085-0}} (p. 287).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism permit the use of ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales: le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international «La raison rusée», Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, pp. 93–118 {{Fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
[[George Edward Moore|G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore]] dealt with casuistry in chapter 1.4 of his ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', in which he claims that "the defects of casuistry are not defects of principle; no objection can be taken to its aim and object. It has failed only because it is far too difficult a subject to be treated adequately in our present state of knowledge". Furthermore, he asserted that "casuistry is the goal of ethical investigation. It cannot be safely attempted at the beginning of our studies, but only at the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since the 1960s, [[applied ethics]] has revived the ideas of casuistry in applying ethical reasoning to particular cases in [[law]], [[bioethics]], and [[business ethics]], so the reputation of casuistry is somewhat rehabilitated.

[[Pope Francis]], a Jesuit, has criticised "the practice of setting general laws on the basis of exceptional cases" as casuistry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140527185002/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1402173.htm "Pope to meet with sex abuse victims for first time in June", Francis X.

'''Christopher William Tindale''' (born 1953) is a Canadian philosopher specializing in [[rhetoric]], [[argumentation theory]], and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref name=WindsorBio &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.uwindsor.ca/ctindale/ |title=University of Windsor staff bios}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tindale is on the editorial board of the journal Informal Logic, and currently serves as the chair of the [[Centre for Research in Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=CRRARBio &gt;{{cite web|url=http://137.207.184.83/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/about/editorialTeam |title=Informal Logic editorial team}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.uwindsor.ca/crrar/christopher-w-tindale |title=CRRAR at University of Windsor}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published numerous books and articles, translated into several languages, with a focus on argumentation and rhetoric.

==Career==
Tindale received his PhD in philosophy from the [[University of Waterloo]]. He worked as a professor at [[Trent University]] for over twenty years, and served as Chair of the department of Ancient History and Classics for part of that time. He has been a professor at the [[University of Windsor]] since 2006.&lt;ref name=WindsorBio /&gt;
His theoretical work stresses the experiential dimensions of argumentation, giving attention to audience reception and the role of the addressee in the argumentative situation. The cognitive environment, as the space in which conviction is experienced and then personalized in persuasion, has been developed in the work since the mid-nineties, culminating in the replacement of Perelman's notorious universal audience with this idea. This in turn has allowed for traditional rhetorical concepts like presence and ethos to be reimagined as important contemporary ideas. Such rhetorical devices are developed as a means of engaging an audience's rationality as well as referring to the specific interests or desires of that audience.
His practical work is reflected in textbooks that translate state-of-the-art research so as to inform the practice of everyday reasoning. This is to be seen in the Oxford textbook (co-authored with Leo Groarke) in its fifth edition, the work on fallacies (2007), and the original German text (2013) that is the first in that language to integrate logical and rhetorical features of argumentation. A further dimension of the practical side of his work has been the examination of conflict resolution strategies, leading to current work which applies the tools of argumentation theory to the problems of deep disagreement and extremism. 
He has provided specific curricular to the Open University system in Germany (FernUniversität in Hagen) and graduate programs on other continents. His work has been translated into Chinese, French, German, Serbian, Spanish, and Russian.
He is an Advisory Editor of the University of Bologna Law Review, a general student-edited law journal published by the Department of Legal Studies of the University of Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bolognalawreview.unibo.it/about/displayMembership/123|title=Advisory Board|author=|publisher=Bolognalawreview.unibo.it|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clergy Letter Project''' is a project that maintains statements in support of the teaching of [[evolution]]  and collects signatures in support of letters from [[United States|American]] [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]],  [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]], and Buddhist  [[clergy]]. The letters make reference to points raised by [[intelligent design]] proponents. There are four separate letters: A Christian Clergy Letter, a [[Rabbi]] Letter, a Unitarian Universalist Clergy Letter and a Buddhist Clergy Letter. As of August 12, 2013, there were 12,878 signatures from Christian clergy, 503 signatures from Jewish rabbis, 273 signatures from Unitarian Universalist clergy and 23 signatures from Buddhist clergy.&lt;ref name="clergy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/ |title=The Clergy Letter Project |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effort was initiated in 2004 by the [[biologist]] [[Michael Zimmerman (biologist)|Michael Zimmerman]], now vice president for academic affairs and [[Provost (education)|provost]] at [[Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evergreen.edu/provost/ |title=The Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost's Office |publisher=Evergreen State College |location=Olympia, Washington |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was written by John McFadden, pastor of the First Congregational [[United Church of Christ]] in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Seed" /&gt;

The project also encourages congregations to participate in '''Evolution Weekend''' by sponsoring events in which clergy and congregations are encouraged to learn about and discuss evolution. The weekend chosen is the closest Sunday to [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] birthday, February 12.&lt;ref name="Weekend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2012.htm |title=2012 Evolution Weekend |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 10, 2007 |title=Faith in the ''other'' good book |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11145 |journal=[[New Scientist]] |publisher=Reed Business Information |volume=193 |issue=2590 |page=4 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)60305-4 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Evolution Sunday''' events first took place in 2006 and the project renamed it in 2008 to be more inclusive. The Clergy Letter Project states that Evolution Weekend activities are "an opportunity for serious discussion and reflection on the [[relationship between religion and science]]" and in an effort "to elevate the quality of the discussion on this critical topic, and to show that religion and science are not adversaries."&lt;ref name="Weekend" /&gt; The project states that events are specifically intended to emphasize that "Religious people from many diverse faith traditions and locations around the world understand that evolution is quite simply sound science; and for them, it does not in any way threaten, demean, or diminish their faith in God. In fact, for many, the wonders of science often enhance and deepen their awe and gratitude towards God."&lt;ref name="Seebach" /&gt;

==Statement==
The letters are entitled ''An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science''. The four letters have somewhat distinct texts.

{{quote|''The Clergy Letter - from American Christian Clergy – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science''

Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret [[Holy Scripture]]. While virtually all Christians take the [[Bible]] seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not [[Biblical literalism|read the Bible literally]], as they would a [[science]] [[textbook]]. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Adam and Eve]], [[Noah's ark|Noah and the ark]] – convey timeless truths about [[God]], [[human beings]], and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.

We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many [[Christian denominations|different traditions]], believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the [[theory of evolution]] is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as "[[Teach the controversy|one theory among others]]" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of [[salvation]] for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of [[reason]] is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge [[school board]] members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;}}

In addition to English, the Christian version of the project has also been translated to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Christian_Clergy/ChrClergyLtr.htm |title=The Clergy Letter - from American Christian Clergy – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rabbi Letter'''

{{quote|''The Clergy Letter - from American Rabbis – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science''

As rabbis from [[Jewish religious movements|various branches of Judaism]], we the undersigned, urge public school boards to affirm their commitment to the teaching of the science of evolution. [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]] of various traditions, who perceive the science of evolution to be in conflict with their personal religious beliefs, are seeking to influence public school boards to authorize the teaching of [[creationism]]. We see this as a breach in the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]. Those who believe in a literal interpretation of the Biblical account of creation are free to teach their perspective in their homes, religious institutions and [[parochial school]]s. To teach it in the public schools would be to assert a particular religious perspective in an environment which is supposed to be free of such indoctrination.

The Bible is the primary source of spiritual inspiration and of values for us and for many others, though not everyone, in our society. It is, however, open to interpretation, with some taking the creation account and other content literally and some preferring a figurative understanding. It is possible to be inspired by the religious teachings of the Bible while not taking a literalist approach and while accepting the validity of science including the foundational concept of evolution. It is not the role of public schools to indoctrinate students with specific religious beliefs but rather to educate them in the established principles of science and in other subjects of general knowledge.&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Jewish_Clergy/JewishClergyLtr.htm |title=The Clergy Letter – from American Rabbis – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Unitarian Universalist Letter'''

{{quote|''The Clergy Letter - from Unitarian Universalist Clergy – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science''

As Unitarian Universalists, we draw from many sources, including "Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life," and "Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit." While most Unitarian Universalists believe that many sacred scriptures convey timeless truths about humans and our relationship to the sacred, we stand in solidarity with our Christian and Jewish brothers and sisters who do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. We believe that religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.

Fundamentalists of various traditions, who perceive the science of evolution to be in conflict with their personal religious beliefs, are seeking to influence public school boards to authorize the teaching of creationism. We see this as a breach in the separation of church and state. Those who believe in a literal interpretation of the Biblical account of creation are free to teach their perspective in their homes, religious institutions and parochial schools. To teach it in the public schools would be to assert a particular religious perspective in an environment which is supposed to be free of such indoctrination.

We the undersigned, Unitarian Universalist clergy, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and other scriptures may comfortably coexist with the discoveries of modern science. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as "one theory among others" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children.

'''Buddhist Clergy Letter'''

{{quote|''The Clergy Letter - from American Buddhist Clergy – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science''

''"If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims  in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and  abandon those claims or adopt them as metaphor."''

The Universe in a Single Atom

Tenzin Gyatso - The Dalai Lama

As the above quote indicates, the Buddhist tradition is  primarily a rational religion. The earliest Buddhist teachings are intended to  help all sentient beings to live a life of integrity in harmony with reality. While  the specific science of evolution is not explicitly taught in our faith, it is  implicit in the core teaching of interdependent origination, which demonstrates  that all things are interconnected and contingent upon one another for their  form and development. Likewise, a creator deity is not relied upon for a  creation story. The ancient Indian fables of the Buddha’s various incarnations from animal to human are readily  understood not as a literal history but as metaphor describing the evolving  nature of life. In fact, the concept of Buddha itself is best understood as a  symbol for humanity’s evolutionary potential. For all of these reasons, we admonish public school boards to affirm their  commitment to teaching the science of evolution. We understand the role of public schools is to  educate students in the established principles of science and in other subjects  of general knowledge.&lt;ref name="Buddhist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Buddhist_Clergy/BuddhistClergyLtr.html |title=The Clergy Letter – from American Buddhist Clergy – An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The project was organized in 2004 by Michael Zimmerman, then a biology professor and dean of the College of Science and Letters at [[University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh]]. He was motivated to create a petition by the actions of the school board in [[Grantsburg, Wisconsin]], which had passed some anti-evolution policies in the summer of 2004. Zimmerman was a veteran of similar disputes in [[Ohio]], when he was a professor at [[Oberlin College]]. After Zimmerman watched [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] clergy from [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], on the television program ''[[Nightline]]'' insisting that decisions about teaching evolution in schools was equivalent to a choice between heaven and hell, he recruited the husband of the head of the university Psychology Department, John McFadden, pastor of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Appleton, Wisconsin, to write a letter describing how science and religion can co-exist.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wittlin |first=Maggie |date=March 23, 2006 |title=Strange Bedfellows |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/strange_bedfellows/ |journal=[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]] |location=New York |publisher=Seed Media Group |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmerman worked with local clergy in Wisconsin to get clergy to sign this letter, and within a few weeks he had collected almost 200 clergy signatures. The signed letter was delivered to the Grantsburg School Board on December 16, 2004. This effort, together with those of other concerned groups of educators, citizens and scientists, lead the Grantsburg School Board to rescind its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petto |first=Andrew J. |date=November–December 2004 |title=Grantsburg Activists Budge School Board |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/24/6/grantsburg-activists-budge-school-board |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=9–11 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this success, Zimmerman was encouraged to organize a nationwide campaign and gather more signatures. By September 12, 2005, the Clergy Letter Project had collected more than 7,500 signatures.&lt;ref name="CF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog01.kintera.com/christianalliance/archives/2005/09/the_clergy_lett.html |title=The Clergy Letter Project |last=Zimmerman |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Zimmerman (biologist) |date=September 12, 2005 |website=Christian Alliance for Progress |type=Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225050522/http://blog01.kintera.com/christianalliance/archives/2005/09/the_clergy_lett.html |archivedate=February 25, 2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of December 2005, the project had amassed more than 10,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="Seed" /&gt; Most of the clergy who signed are [[Protestantism|Protestant]], an artifact of the way that people were originally invited to sign the letter. Email invitations were sent, and it was easier to get email addresses for some churches and denominations than others.&lt;ref name="Seebach" /&gt;

The clergy letter was at first limited to Christian clergy, and Zimmerman declined offers from Jewish and [[Islam|Muslim]] clergy.&lt;ref name="Inside"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jaschik |first=Scott |date=February 21, 2006 |title=Inspired Reinforcements |url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/02/21/clergy |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Kathlene Collins |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman stated that "Since it is fundamentalist Christian ministers who have been shouting to the American people that they must choose between religion and science, it seemed reasonable to have thousands upon thousands of Christian clergy assert otherwise. It simply wouldn't be very persuasive to have leaders of other religions saying to Christians that Christian fundamentalist ministers are not speaking for all Christians...the Clergy Letter Project and Evolution Sunday are not designed to change the minds of fundamentalists. Rather, our goal is to educate the vast majority of Christians who, if told they have to choose between religion and modern science, are likely to opt for religion."&lt;ref name="Seebach"&gt;{{cite news |last=Seebach |first=Linda |date=February 10, 2007 |title=Seebach: Reaching out to Christians on evolution |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/feb/10/bseebachb-reaching-out-to-christians-on/ |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |location=Denver, Colorado |publisher=E. W. Scripps Company |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, however, three additional statements were added to the project: a Jewish rabbi letter, a Unitarian Universalist clergy letter, and a Buddhist clergy letter.

==Evolution Weekend and related activities==
Zimmerman and the Clergy Letter Project also organize "Evolution Weekend," an annual movement to encourages churches to discuss the role of science and religion in [[sermon]]s, discussion groups, [[seminar]]s, and other activities on the weekend nearest to February 12, the birthday of Charles Darwin ([[Darwin Day]]). The day began in 2006 as "Evolution Sunday," gaining attention from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Banerjee |first1=Neela |last2=Berryman |first2=Anne |date=February 13, 2006 |title=At Churches Nationwide, Good Words for Evolution |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/13/national/13evolution.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |others=Additional reporting contributed by Gretchen Ruethling |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it was renamed "Evolution Weekend" to incorporate more faith traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Evolution_Weekend/2008_evol_weekend.htm |title=2008 Evolution Weekend |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 652 congregations from all 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] as well as 13 countries participated in Evolution Weekend activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2009.htm |title=2011 Evolution Weekend |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmerman and the Clergy Letter Project maintain a list of 1,052 scientists from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, [[Puerto Rico]], and 32 countries, who have agreed to serve as "technical consultants to clergy members who have questions about the science associated with all aspects of evolution." The project states that "The very existence of this list clearly demonstrates the willingness of scientists to work collaboratively with clergy members. Together, scientists and clergy members demonstrate that religion and science can have a complementary and positive relationship with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Resources/sci_expert_data_base.htm |title=Scientific Consultants - scientists on call to help clergy |website=The Clergy Letter Project |publisher=Ovation Agency |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution Weekend often gained attention from several news outlets, with participating clergy being interviewed in local publications.&lt;ref name="Seebach" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Benson |first=Adam |date=February 13, 2006 |title=Having faith in science |url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/article_c16c0d5c-e85b-5692-9a2a-9e987590d9e9.html |newspaper=[[The Herald Journal]] |location=Logan, Utah |publisher=[[Pioneer News Group]] |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction from creationists==
The creationist [[Discovery Institute]], which arranged its own anti-evolution petition called ''[[A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]'' in 2001 criticized the project. Discovery Institute communications director Rob Crowther asserted that the [[Creation–evolution controversy|disputes about evolution]] was "purely a scientific debate" and that clergy petitions are irrelevant, stating that clergy "don't make any difference," since "We don't think there is anything religious at all to the theory of intelligent design." Zimmerman described this argument as part of the problem, as [[intelligent design]] tried to undermine science by changing it from a study of the natural world to include supernatural explanations, and it was important for clergy to defend science against these attacks.&lt;ref name="Inside" /&gt;

[[Ken Ham]] and Mark Looy of the creationist organization [[Answers in Genesis]] have repeatedly condemned Evolution Sunday/Evolution Weekend activities as a "Darwin praise service" and expressing dismay that "over 10,200 clergy had signed this awful letter." Ham and Looy also criticized Zimmerman's fundraising efforts through the Christian Alliance for Progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2006/02/06/praise-darwin-sunday |title=In Praise of Darwin This Sunday … In Hundreds of Churches! |last1=Ham |first1=Ken |authorlink=Ken Ham |last2=Looy |first2=Mark |date=February 6, 2006 |website=[[Answers in Genesis]] |publisher=Ken Ham |location=Hebron, Kentucky |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2007/02/08/churches-praise-darwin |title=Churches in praise of . . .

Jonathan Dudley, a divinity student at [[Yale University]] and author of the book ''Broken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics'' (2011),{{sfn|Dudley 2011}} wrote approvingly of Evolution Sunday in the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' on January 24, 2007, while still worrying that congregations were not being taught to think for themselves with this current campaign, any more than subscribing to fundamentalist Christian [[Biblical literalism|Biblical literalist]] doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dudley |first=Jonathan |date=January 24, 2007 |title=Evolution Sunday not so benign |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/01/24/evolution-sunday-not-so-benign/ |newspaper=[[Yale Daily News]] |type=Blog |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=The Yale Daily News Publishing Company |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Discovery Institute fellow [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathon Wells]] to write a scathing article in the ''Yale Daily News'' about Evolution Sunday, "[[Darwinism]]," and Zimmerman. Wells repeated creationist objections to evolution by claiming that there is no [[Evidence of common descent|evidence of evolution]] and condemning evolution for not being in agreement with the views of 40% of the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wells |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate) |date=January 29, 2007 |title=Churches shouldn't buy into Darwinists' ploy |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/01/29/churches-shouldnt-buy-into-darwinists-ploy/ |newspaper=Yale Daily News |type=Blog |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=The Yale Daily News Publishing Company |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman responded to Wells' attack with a column in the ''Yale Daily News'' pointing out the copious errors of fact in Wells' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Michael |date=February 5, 2007 |title=Writer missed point of Evolution Sunday |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/02/05/writer-missed-point-of-evolution-sunday/ |newspaper=Yale Daily News |type=Blog |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=The Yale Daily News Publishing Company |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells followed this with a letter to the editor in the ''Yale Daily News''. Wells brushed over the points Zimmerman had raised, and focused on whether the word "Darwinism" is appropriate or not. Wells also responded with vigor to two others who had written letters to the editor critical of his original article. Finally, Wells claimed that the only reason to stage Evolution Sunday is because evolution is not "scientifically sound or religiously neutral," and that it is "promoting an anti-religious philosophy disguised as empirical science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wells |first=Jonathan |date=February 7, 2007 |title=Writer responds to criticism of his ideas on science, Evolution Sunday |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/02/07/letter-to-the-editor-9/ |newspaper=Yale Daily News |type=Letter to the editor |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=The Yale Daily News Publishing Company |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Iowa]] faculty member Tara C.

The French '''Commission on renewal and ethics in public life''' (in French ''[[:fr:Commission sur la rénovation et la déontologie de la vie publique|Commission sur la rénovation et la déontologie de la vie publique]]''), nicknamed '''Jospin commission''', was a think tank established in 2012 by President [[François Hollande]] to provide reforms in public life.&lt;ref group="TNote" name="publiclife"&gt;''Public life'' is translated from the French ''la vie public'' and refers to holding elected and appointed positions in national and/or local government&lt;/ref&gt;

This commission, which is responsible for considering institutional and public life, made its report in November [[2012 in France|2012]] and proposed reductions in holding [[Cumul des mandats|multiple elected offices]]&lt;ref group="TNote" name="cumuldesmandats"&gt;Holding multiple elected offices (cumul des mandats in French) is common in France. For example, Senators often also serve as the Mayor of a city or town.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]; as well as the methods of election of the President of the Republic and legislators.

With the exception of a few measures on declaration of conflicts of interest or the restriction of multiple directorships, most proposals have not been implemented.

This Committee was preceded by other committees exploring the same subject, including:
* The [[:fr:Comité de réflexion et de proposition sur la modernisation et le rééquilibrage des institutions|Committee on discussion and proposals for the modernization and consolidation of institutions]], also called ''Balladur Commission'' , appointed in 2007 by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].
* The [[:fr:Commission Vedel|Vedel Commission]], named in 1992 by [[François Mitterrand]].

== Work of the commission ==
The announcement of the establishment of the commission was made during an interview the President of the Republic on {{date|14 July 2012}}.

The commission was set up by the Decree of {{date|16 July 2012}}.&lt;ref name="decree"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000026194414&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id |title=Décret n° 2012-875 du 16 juillet 2012 portant création d'une commission de rénovation et de déontologie de la vie publique |language=French |trans-title=Decree No. 2012-875 of 16 July 2012 establishing a commission renewal and ethics in public life |publisher=LegiFrance |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting was on Wednesday July 25;&lt;ref name="nouvelobs1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20120726.OBS8267/jospin-s-attaque-au-cumul-des-mandats-apres-l-ete.html |title=Jospin s'attaque au cumul des mandats... après l'été |language=French |trans-title=Jospin addresses multiple directorships ... after summer is over |author=L'Obs |date=4 September 2012 |publisher=L'Obs |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the commission decided to take time for reflection until August.&lt;ref name="nouvelobs1" /&gt;

[[François Hollande]] received the report of the Committee on {{date|9 November 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roger |first=Patrick |date=9 November 2012 |title=La commission Jospin préconise d'en finir avec le cumul des mandats |trans-title=The commission recommends Jospin to end the dual mandate |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/11/09/la-commission-jospin-preconise-d-en-finir-avec-le-cumul-des-mandats_1788360_823448.html |language=French |newspaper=Le Monde |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose ===
The purpose of the commission, as its name suggests, was to make proposals to renovate the political field of French public life.&lt;ref group="TNote" name="publiclife" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2012/07/26/97001-20120726FILWWW00322-moralisation-jospin-defend-sa-commission.php |title=Moralisation : Jospin ira "assez vite" |date=26 July 2012 |publisher=Le Figaro.fr |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission particularly needed to consider the following items:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2012/07/25/01002-20120725ARTFIG00572-la-commission-jospin-sur-les-rails.php |title=La commission Jospin sur les rails |language=French |trans-title=The Jospin commission on track |date=25 July 2012 |publisher=Le Figaro.fr |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Define the conditions for improving the conduct of the presidential election (adequacy of the current system of sponsorship of candidates, terms of campaign financing, rules for communication by candidates in the media);
* Adjust the timing of legislative elections the come after the presidential election;

=== Compensation ===
A rumor, spread in particular by e-mail,&lt;ref name="asi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arretsurimages.net/vite.php?id=14310 |title=Commission Jospin : fausse rumeur sur des rémunérations |language=French |trans-title=Commission Jospin: false rumor on remuneration |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=arretssurimage.net |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; complained of exorbitant compensation for four months of work by members of the committee and each of their consultants, at a cost of several million francs. On the radio, Lionel Jospin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europe1.fr/Politique/Jospin-travaillera-gratuitement-1182765/ |title=Jospin travaillera "gratuitement" |language=French |trans-title=Jospin travels "free" |author=Frédéric Frangeul |date=26 July 2012 |publisher=Europe 1 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; several journalists and former members of previous commissions&lt;ref name="asi" /&gt; have in turn denied the allegations.

However, in late September, commission member [[Roselyne Bachelot]], feeling particularly targeted by rumors, decided to publicly complain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europe1.fr/Politique/Commission-Jospin-Bachelot-porte-plainte-1258491/ |title=Commission Jospin: Bachelot porte plainte |language=French |trans-title=Commission Jospin: Bachelot complains |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Europe 1 |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Analysis ===
According to [[Claude Allègre]] and [[Denis Jeambar]], who co-wrote an editorial in ''[[Le Monde]]'' in September 2012, this commission is in line with the commitment of each of the former presidents of the 5th Republic to revise the constitution according to their taste, past presidents setting up expert committees which met behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="critique"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/09/24/la-commission-jospin-doit-changer-de-methode_1764597_3232.html |title=Claude Allègre : "La commission Jospin doit changer de méthode!" |language=French |trans-title=Claude Allegre, "The Jospin commission must change the method!" |author= Claude Allègre and Denis Jeambar |date=24 September 2012 |publisher=Le Monde.fr |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The character of the men and women is not being questioned. However, the method used makes for almost inevitable failure. These committees work in confidentiality. So, when their findings are revealed, critical thinking prevails, the controversy settled, oppositions are firing on all cylinders and the President, to calm the political game, buries everything. We will see if it is different with François Hollande, but a change in method could give him greater freedom of action and decision (translated).&lt;ref group="TNote"&gt;Original French: ''La qualité des hommes et des femmes n'est pas en cause. En revanche, la méthode rend l'échec presque inévitable. Ces commissions travaillent dans la confidentialité. Du coup, lorsque sont dévoilées leurs conclusions, l'esprit critique l'emporte, les polémiques s'installent, les oppositions font feu de tout bois et le président, pour calmer le jeu politique, enterre tout. On verra s'il en va autrement avec François Hollande, mais un changement de méthode pourrait lui donner une plus grande liberté d'action et de décision.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Implementation ==

On 20 February 2013, two bills are presented to the Council of Minister relating to the election of senators. Their purpose was to extend the proportional voting to departments with three or more senators, as well as increase the number of delegates from large cities and change the representation of French outside France (expatriate). These laws were enacted in July and August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027799541&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id |title=LOI n° 2013-702 du 2 août 2013 relative à l'élection des sénateurs |language=French |trans-title=LAW n° 2013-702 of 2 August 2013 about the elected of senators |date=2 August 2013 |website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |publisher=Le Service Public de la Defussion de Droit |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027734839&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id |title=LOI n° 2013-659 du 22 juillet 2013 relative à la représentation des Français établis hors de France |language=French |trans-title=Law n° 2013-659 of 22 July 2013 on the representation of French established outside France  |date= 22 July 2013|website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |publisher=Le Service Public de la Defussion de Droit |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2013, four constitutional bills are presented to the Council of Ministers:
* Elimination of the [[:fr:Cour de justice de la République|Cour de Justice de la République]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichLoiPreparation.do?idDocument=JORFDOLE000027174181&amp;type=general |title=Dossiers législatifs - Projet de loi constitutionnelle relatif à la responsabilité juridictionnelle du Président de la République et des membres du Gouvernement (PRMX1306705L) |language=French |trans-title=Constitutional law relative to the jurisdictional responsibility of the President of the Republic and of members of the Government |date=15 March 2013 |website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |publisher=Le Service Public de la Defussion de Droit |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform of the penal code pertaining to the head of state was no longer considered. For these four texts, the government wanted a meeting of the Congress in July, but because of lack of time and sufficient majority, only the project on Higher Judicial Council was discussed in Parliament, but the Senate stripped the bill of its content. After this, the Government was forced to postpone the revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Laurent |first=Corinne |date=4 July 2013 |title=Le gouvernement renonce à convoquer le Congrès sur la réforme du Conseil supérieur de la magistrature

The text on the Supreme Judicial Council was implemented in the bill on the powers of the Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutors in criminal policy and public action, presented by the Council of Ministers on 27 March and issued July 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027751362&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id |title=LOI n° 2013-669 du 25 juillet 2013 relative aux attributions du garde des sceaux et des magistrats du ministère public en matière de politique pénale et de mise en œuvre de l'action publique

On 3 April 2013, two texts are presented to the Cabinet:
* Prohibition of holding local executive office at the same time as holding the office of Deputy or Senator.
* Prohibition of holding local executive office at the same time as holding the office of Representative to the European Parliament. 
These texts were in force in 2017 instead of 2014 at the request of certain socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bekmezian |first=Hélène |date=26 June 2013 |title=

Following the [[:fr:Affaire Cahuzac|Cahuzac affair]], further reforms were prepared:

'''''Continuismo''''' ({{lang-en|Continuism}}) is the practice by incumbents of keeping themselves in office beyond the legal term.&lt;ref&gt;Roland H. Ebel. "Continuismo" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 257. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conaghan06"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fujimori's Peru | year = 2006 |first = Catherine M. | last = Conaghan | publisher = Univ. of Pittsburgh Press | ISBN = 0-8229-5943-7
}} page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Some Latin American heads of state indefinitely extend their rule by way of reducing or abolishing [[term limit]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell F. Fitzgibbon, "Continuismo: The Search for Political Longevity" in ''Caudillos: Dictators in Spanish America'', Hugh M. Hamill, ed. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1992, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; via constitutional revision. Examples are ([[Juan Perón]], Argentina; [[Alfredo Stroessner]], Paraguay; [[Evo Morales]], Bolivia). Another tactic is legislative enactment, such as with ([[Jorge Ubico]], Guatemala in 1941). A third tactic is by plebiscite ([[Carlos Castillo Armas]], Guatemala [1954]) and [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] ,Venezuela, 1958)) and the 1988 failed attempt by [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile. A further type is internal [[coup d'état|coup]] ([[Getulio Vargas]], Brazil). Yet another way is the imposition of a weak successor candidate allowing rule by the outgoing incumbent ([[Emilio Portes Gil]] and [[Abelardo Rodríguez]] in Mexico allowing [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], "''el jefe máximo''", to continue ruling, a period known as the [[Maximato]]). The extension of family rule occurred in Nicaragua with the [[Somoza family]]; in Argentina with Juan Perón; and then more recently [[Nestor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]; and in Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and his brother [[Raúl Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;Ebel, "Continuismo" p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Peru's one term limit established by its 1979 constitution, [[Alberto Fujimori]] illegally extended his rule to ten years through two re-elections.&lt;ref name="Conaghan06"/&gt;

The '''face-to-face''' relation ({{lang-fr|rapport de face à face}}) is a concept in the French [[philosopher]] [[Emmanuel Lévinas]]' thought on human sociality. It means that, ethically, people are responsible to one-another in the face-to-face encounter. Specifically, Lévinas says that the human face "orders and ordains" us. It calls the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] into “giving and serving” the Other.&lt;ref&gt;Lévinas, ''Ethics and Infinity'', 1985, pp. 95, 98, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marcus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxP92H6LFs8C&amp;dq= ''In Search of the Good Life: Emmanuel Levinas, Psychoanalysis and the Art of Living''], Karnac Books, 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Lévinas' phenomenological account of the "face-to-face" encounter serves as the basis for his [[ethics]] and the rest of his philosophy. For Lévinas, "Ethics is the first philosophy." Lévinas argues that the encounter of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] through the [[Face (sociological concept)|face]] reveals a certain poverty which forbids a reduction to [[identity (philosophy)|Sameness]] and, simultaneously, installs a responsibility for the Other in the [[Self (philosophy)|Self]].

Lévinas' account of the face-to-face encounter bears many similarities to [[Martin Buber]]'s "[[I and Thou]]" relation. Its influence is also particularly pronounced in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ethical writings. (However, some post-structuralist thinkers maintain that Derrida does not agree with Lévinas. See, perhaps most significantly, [[Martin Hägglund]].)

The major difference between Buber's account of the [[I and Thou]] relation and the ethics of the face-to-face encounter is the application of Lévinas' asymmetry towards the other.  For Buber, ethical relation meant a "symmetrical co-presence," while Lévinas, on the other hand, considers the relation with the other as something inherently asymmetrical: the other as they appear, the face, gives itself priority to the self, its first demand even before I react to it, love it or kill it, is: "thou shalt not kill me". Such a demand for Lévinas is prior to any reaction or any assertion of freedom by a subject. The face of the other in this sense looms above the other person and traces "where God passes." God (the [[infinite Other]]) here refers to the God of which one cannot refuse belief in Its history, that is the God who appears in traditional belief and of scripture and not some conceptual God of philosophy or [[ontotheology]].

{{quote|The face, in its nudity and defenselessness, signifies: “Do not kill me.” This defenseless nudity is therefore a passive resistance to the desire that is my freedom. Any exemplification of the face's expression, moreover, carries with it this combination of resistance and defenselessness: Lévinas speaks of the face of the other who is “widow, orphan, or stranger.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/ |title=Emmanuel Levinas |first=Bettina |last=Bergo |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the face-to-face encounter we also see how Lévinas splits ethics from morality.  Ethics marks the primary situation of the face-to-face whereas morality comes later, as some kind of, agreed upon or otherwise, set of rules that emerge from the social situation, wherein there are more than just the two people of the face-to-face encounter.
This ethical relation for Lévinas is prior to an [[ontology]] of nature, instead he refers to it as a [[meontology]], which affirms a meaning beyond [[Being]], a mode of non-Being (Greek: ''me on'').

==Comparison==
Face-to-face is similar to [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s ethical concept in art and answerability and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of the authentic guilt (present/face-to-face) as opposed to an inauthentic other.

The '''Free Spirit Alliance''' (FSA) is a non-profit spiritual networking organization serving the [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[pantheist]] communities.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Alder, Margot (1986). ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]''. New York: Penguin Compass. {{ISBN|0-14-019536-X}}. p 514&lt;/ref&gt; Founded on May 21, 1986&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdatcert3.resiusa.org/UCC-Charter/default.aspx Maryland DAT Corporate Registrations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207205159/http://sdatcert3.resiusa.org/UCC-Charter/default.aspx |date=2009-02-07 }} See filing date of organization's charter with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation&lt;/ref&gt; and based in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] area of the United States, the alliance's focus has been on presenting regional and local events where people from diverse backgrounds can learn and share ideas. Its promotional literature and website state that the organization has striven to develop a national reputation for being willing to work with often sensitive and personal issues in a friendly and safe environment.

FSA’s main event is the Free Spirit Gathering, held in June.&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freespiritgathering.org/index.html Free Spirit Gathering]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also run a retreat event in the fall.&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt; The gathering is held at a private campground near [[Darlington, Maryland|Darlington]], [[Maryland]]. FSA previously ran Sacred Sexuality Beltane (held over five days at [[Beltane]] in May). That festival has been transferred to Turtle Hill Events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtlehillevents.org/beltane/ The Beltane Gathering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910012159/http://www.turtlehillevents.org/beltane/ |date=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Spirit Gathering is by far the organization's largest event, attracting people from as far away as [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Texas]], [[Minnesota]] and Canada. It is one of the oldest Pagan festivals in the country,&lt;ref&gt;Paige,Anthony (2003).

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xuvLRbKvyGEC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=%22free%20spirit%20gathering%22&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q=%22free%20spirit%20gathering%22&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism]''. Citadel Press. {{ISBN|0-8065-2407-3}}. p 309&lt;/ref&gt;

FSA also sponsors several other smaller events and rituals in the [[Washington, DC]] and [[Maryland]] areas.

&lt;!-- FSA sponsors an annual scholarship, consisting of two $500 awards given to students in an undergraduate/postsecondary program of higher learning. In its initial year, 2004, the scholarship was funded by a unique tattoo design contest: FSA's president George Marvil volunteered to let the community vote on a design that he would have tattooed on his arm, at a cost of $10 per vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040626&amp;slug=scholarships26 Calling all duck-callers and druids: Quirky attributes yield college cash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witchvox.com/vn/vn_detail/dt_no.html?a=usmd&amp;id=192 FSA starts College Fund for Pagan Kids]&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship has since been named in Marvil's honor. --&gt;

The right to study and modify a computer program entails that [[source code]]—the preferred format for making changes—be made available to users of that program.

Freeware (green) seldom expose their source code.&lt;ref name="wolfire2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Open-source-software-is-not-always-freeware |title=Open-source software is not always freeware |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=David |last=Rosen |publisher=[[Wolfire Games|wolfire]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Free software thus differs from:
* [[proprietary software]], such as [[Microsoft Office]], [[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets|Sheets]], and [[Google Slides|Slides]] or [[iWork]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Users cannot study, change, and share their [[source code]].
* [[freeware]], which is a category of proprietary software that does not require payment for basic use.

For software under the purview of [[copyright]] to be free, it must carry a [[software license]] whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the [[public domain]], is free as long as the source code is in the public domain too, or otherwise available without restrictions.

Proprietary software uses restrictive software licences or [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and usually does not provide users with the source code. Users are thus legally or technically prevented from [[patch (computing)|changing]] the software, and this results on reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support. (See also [[vendor lock-in]] and [[abandonware]]). Users often may not [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]], modify, or redistribute proprietary software.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; Beyond copyright law, contracts and lack of source code; there could be additional shenanigans keeping users from exercising freedom over a piece of software, such as [[software patent]]s and [[digital rights management]] (more specifically, [[tivoization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|title = The Last Mile is Always the Hardest|date = 17 July 2008|accessdate = 29 December 2014|website = [[Free Software Foundation|fsf.org]]|publisher = |last = Sullivan|first = John|authorlink = William John Sullivan|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230334/http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|archivedate = 28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be noted that free software can be a for-profit, commercial activity or not. Some free software is developed by volunteer [[Programmer|computer programmers]] while other is developed by corporations; or even by both.&lt;ref name="Popp2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Dr. Karl Michael | last = Popp | title = Best Practices for commercial use of open source software | year = 2015 | publisher = Books on Demand | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 978-3738619096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Naming}}Naming and differences with Open Source ===

{{main article|Alternative terms for free software}}
Although both definitions refer to almost equivalent corpora of programs, the Free Software Foundation recommends using the term "free software" rather than "[[open-source software]]" (a younger vision coined in 1998), because the goals and messaging are quite dissimilar. "Open source" and its associated campaign mostly focus on the technicalities of the [[Open-source model|public development model]] and marketing free software to businesses, while taking the ethical issue of user rights very lightly or even antagonistically.&lt;ref name="misses-the-point"/&gt; Stallman has also stated that considering the practical advantages of free software is like considering the practical advantages of not being handcuffed, in that it is not necessary for an individual to consider practical reasons in order to realize that being handcuffed is undesirable in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/practical.html |title=The advantages of free software |authorlink=Richard Stallman |first=Richard |last=Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSF also notes that "Open Source" has exactly one specific meaning in common English, namely that "you can look at the source code." It states that while the term "Free Software" can lead to two different interpretations, at least one of them is consistent with the intended meaning unlike the term "Open Source".{{efn|Access to source code is a necessary but insufficient condition, according to both the Free Software and Open Source definitions.}} The loan adjective "[[wikt:libre|libre]]" is often used to avoid the ambiguity of the word "free" in [[English language]], and the ambiguity with the older usage of "free software" as public domain software.&lt;ref name="infoworld1983" /&gt; See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].

=={{anchor|Definition}}Definition and the Four Freedoms==

{{Main article|The Free Software Definition}}
{{see also|Debian Free Software Guidelines|Open Source Definition}}
[[File:Categories of free and nonfree software.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of free and nonfree software, as defined by the Free Software Foundation. Left: free software, right: proprietary software, encircled: [[Freeware|Gratis software]]]]

The first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.&lt;ref name="bull6"/&gt; That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms.&lt;ref name="free-sw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html|title=Four Freedoms - FSFE|work=fsfe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of [[zero-based numbering]] in programming languages, but also because "Freedom 0" was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.
* Freedom 0: The freedom to ''run'' the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to ''study'' how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to ''redistribute'' and make copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to ''improve'' the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

Freedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.

Thus, free software means that [[User (computing)|computer users]] have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. To summarize this into a remark distinguishing ''libre'' (freedom) software from ''[[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]'' (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in '[[freedom of speech|free speech]]', not as in 'free beer{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="free-sw"/&gt; See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].

In the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. The most notable are [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] published in 1997,&lt;ref name="Perens"/&gt; and the [[The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]], published in 1998.

The [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based operating systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], do not have their own formal definitions of free software. Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive. They generally advocate [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software licenses]], which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally ''forced'' to provide the source code. Their view is that this permissive approach is more free. The [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[MIT License|X11]], and [[Apache License|Apache]] software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.

== Examples ==

{{Main article|List of free and open-source software packages}}There are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the Internet. Users can easily download and install those applications via a  [[package manager]] that comes included with most [[Linux distributions]].

The [[Free Software Directory]] maintains a large database of free software packages. Some of the best-known examples include the [[Linux kernel]], the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and Linux operating systems, the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU C Library|C library]]; the [[MySQL]] relational database; the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server; and the [[Sendmail]] mail transport agent. Other influential examples include the [[Emacs]] text editor; the [[GIMP]] raster drawing and image editor; the [[X Window System]] graphical-display system; the [[LibreOffice]] office suite; and the [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] typesetting systems.&lt;gallery caption="Free Software" widths="200" heights="150" showfilename="yes"&gt;

== History ==

{{further|History of free and open-source software}}
{{see also|Open-source software#History}}
[[File:Rms ifi large.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[Free Software Movement]] (2009)]]

From the 1950s up until the early 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the ''software freedoms'' associated with free software, which was typically [[public domain software]].&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;ots=IdSaFSmKVK&amp;dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;f=false |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain. Public-domain software is written by microcomputer hobbyists (also known as "hackers") many of whom are professional programmers in their work life. [...] Since everybody has access to source code, many routines have not only been used but dramatically improved by other programmers."'' |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Software]] was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and by hardware manufacturers who welcomed the fact that people were making software that made their hardware useful. Organizations of users and suppliers, for example, [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]], were formed to facilitate exchange of software. As software was often written in an interpreted language such as [[BASIC]], the [[source code]] was distributed to use these programs. Software was also shared and distributed as printed source code ([[Type-in program]]) in [[computer magazine]]s (like [[Creative Computing]], [[SoftSide]], [[Compute!]], [[Byte magazine|Byte]] etc) and books, like the bestseller ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s, the picture changed: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of "free" software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]].&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; While some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer program]]s) to prevent [[User (computing)|computer users]] from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. In 1980, [[copyright]] law was extended to computer programs.

In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], one of the original authors of the popular [[Emacs]] program and a longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary [[Unix-like|Unix-compatible]] operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. In his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional [[hacker ethic]]. Software development for the [[GNU|GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of "[[copyleft]]", designed to ensure ''software freedom'' for all.
Some non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under [[copyleft]] licenses (see the [[OpenCores]] project, for instance). [[Creative Commons]] and the [[free culture movement]] have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.

===1980s: Foundation of the GNU project===
In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.&lt;ref&gt;[[#William02|William 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the [[GNU Manifesto]]. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[The Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]]'' and "[[copyleft]]" ideas.

===1990s: Release of the Linux kernel===
The [[Linux kernel]], started by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The first licence was a proprietary software licence. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.
[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as free software when the [[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.|USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].

All free software licenses must grant users all the freedoms discussed above. However, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of [[License compatibility|license technicalities]]. Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.

The majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. The most popular of these licenses are:&lt;ref name="blackduck2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-licenses |quote=''1. MIT license 24%, 2.

* The [[MIT License]]
* The [[GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License v2]]
* The [[Apache License]]
* The [[GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License v3]]
* The [[BSD licenses|BSD License]]
* The [[GNU Lesser General Public License]]
* The [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL)
* The [[Eclipse Public License]]

The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative both publish lists of licenses that they find to comply with their own definitions of free software and open-source software respectively:
* [[Comparison of free and open-source software licenses|List of FSF approved software licenses]]
* [[Open-source license|List of OSI approved software licenses]]

The FSF list is not prescriptive: free licenses can exist that the FSF has not heard about, or considered important enough to write about. So it's possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All open-source licenses must meet the [[Open Source Definition]] in order to be officially recognized as open source software. Free software on the other hand is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.

Apart from these two organizations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. Debian doesn't publish a list of ''approved'' licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.&lt;ref name="Debian"/&gt;

It is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the [[Open Source Definition]], although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the [[NASA Open Source Agreement]] is an OSI-approved license, but non-free according to FSF).

There are different categories of free software.
* [[Public domain]] software: the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted (released without [[copyright notice]] before 1988), or the author has released the software onto the public domain with a [[waiver]] statement (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free. The FSF recommends the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] public domain dedication for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0|work=gnu.org|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[permissive free software licence|Permissive licenses]], also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] operating systems: these licenses are also known as [[Free content#Copyfree|copyfree]] as they have no restrictions on distribution.&lt;ref name="copyfree"/&gt; The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and '''any''' modification, even closed-source ones. In this sense, a permissive license provides an incentive to create non-free software, by reducing the cost of developing restricted software. Since this is incompatible with the spirit of software freedom, many people consider permissive licenses to be less free than copyleft licenses.
* [[Copyleft]] licenses, with the [[GNU General Public License]] being the most prominent: the author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same "copyleft" license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a [[viral license|''viral'']], ''[[protective license|protective]]'', or ''reciprocal'' license. Due to the restriction on distribution not everyone considers this type of license to be free.&lt;!-- this last one 404ed at the original source so a quoted copy works --&gt;&lt;ref name="charvolant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sunsetbrew"/&gt;

There is debate over the [[Computer security|security]] of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being [[security through obscurity]]. A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.

Free software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist,&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt; (This is called "Security Through Disclosure"&lt;ref name="albion" /&gt;) and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden [[spyware]] functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.&lt;ref name="rms-fs-2006-03-09" /&gt;

Some quantitative studies have been done on the subject.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fuzz-revisited" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fuzz-macos" /&gt;

===Binary blobs and other proprietary software===
In 2006, [[OpenBSD]] started the first campaign against the use of [[binary blob]]s in [[Kernel (computing)|kernels]]. Blobs are usually freely distributable [[device driver]]s for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have [[Software bug|bugs]], they pose a security risk to any [[operating system]] whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.

The issue of binary blobs in the [[Linux kernel]] and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch [[gNewSense]], a Linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the [[Free Software Foundation]] and stimulated the creation, headed by the [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]], of the [[Linux-libre]] kernel.&lt;ref name="FreeGNULinuxDistributions" /&gt; As of October 2012, [[Trisquel]] is the most popular FSF endorsed Linux distribution ranked by Distrowatch (over 12 months).&lt;ref name="DW02" /&gt; While [[Debian]] is not endorsed by the FSF and does not use Linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.&lt;ref name="FreeGNULinuxDistributions" /&gt;

== Business model ==

{{see also|Business models for open-source software}}

[[Commercial software|Selling software]] under any free software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. This is true for licenses with or without [[copyleft]].&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="linfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsdl-gpl"/&gt;

Since free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification.&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt; Exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.&lt;ref name="paid-and-libre"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2016-02/msg00227.html |title=[libreplanet-discuss] Is there any software that is libre but not gratis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable USB drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, [[crowdfunding]], corporate contributions, and tax money. The [[SELinux]] project at the United States [[National Security Agency]] is an example of a federally funded free software project.

Proprietary software on the other hand tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.&lt;ref name="Dornan"/&gt;

The Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. As the Foundation has written, "distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don't waste it!".&lt;ref name="selling"/&gt; For example, the FSF's own recommended license (the [[GNU GPL]]) states that "[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee."&lt;ref name="GPLsection4"/&gt;

Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] stated in 2001 that "open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source."&lt;ref name="suntimes"/&gt; This misunderstanding is based on a requirement of [[copyleft]] licenses (like the GPL) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. This requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer. The claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and Free Software is also a misunderstanding. There are several large companies, e.g. [[Red Hat]] and [[IBM]], which do substantial commercial business in the development of Free Software.

Free software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of [[dot-com companies]].&lt;ref name="Web Server Survey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apache Strategy" /&gt; Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a [[pure public good]] rather than a [[private good]]. Companies that contribute to free software increase commercial [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Teresa|last1=Waring|first2=Philip|last2=Maddocks|title=Open Source Software implementation in the UK public sector: Evidence from the field and implications for the future|url=http://doai.io/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2005.06.00|journal=International Journal of Information Management|date=1 October 2005|pages=411–428|volume=25|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2005.06.002|quote=In addition OSS’s development process is creating innovative products that are reliable, secure, practical and have high usability and performance ratings.

The economic viability of free software has been recognized by large corporations such as [[IBM]], [[Red Hat]], and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref name="ibm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-erick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gpl-java" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MERIT-floss" /&gt; Many companies whose core business is not in the IT sector choose free software for their Internet information and sales sites, due to the lower initial capital investment and ability to freely customize the application packages. Most companies in the software business include free software in their commercial products if the licenses allow that.&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt;

Free software is generally available at no cost and can result in permanently lower [[TCO costs]] compared to [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="eprints" /&gt; With free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them. Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.

A report by [[Standish Group]] estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the [[proprietary software]] industry by about $60 billion per year.&lt;ref name="standishgroup" /&gt; In spite of this, [[Eric S. Raymond]] argues that the term ''free software'' is too ambiguous and intimidating for the business community. Raymond promotes the term ''[[open-source software]]'' as a friendlier alternative for the business and corporate world.&lt;ref name="esr" /&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively) — on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c.1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental imagery in everyday life==

===Two ways of generating mental imagery===

There are two fundamental ways by which [[mental image]]ry is generated: voluntary and involuntary.

The involuntary and spontaneous generation of mental images is integral to ordinary sensory perception, and [[cognition]], and occurs without [[Volition (psychology)|volitional]] intent. Meanwhile, many different aspects of everyday problem solving, [[scientific reasoning]], and [[Creativity|creative activity]] involve the volitional and deliberate generation of mental images.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

====Involuntary====

The generation of involuntary mental imagery is created directly from present sensory stimulation and perceptual information, such as when someone sees an object, creates mental images of it, and maintains this imagery as they look away or close their eyes; or when someone hears a noise and maintains an [[Auditory system|auditory]] image of it, after the sound ceases or is no longer perceptible.

====Voluntary====

Voluntary mental imagery may resemble previous sensory perception and experience, recalled from [[memory]]; or the images may be entirely novel and the product of [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitch, G. J., Brandimonte, M. A., and Walker, P., Two types of representation in visual memory—Evidence from the effects of stimulus contrast on image combination.

Imagination, Cognition, and Personality, Vol. 23, Nos. 2-3, 2004, pp183–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===

The term ''guided imagery'' denotes the technique used in the second (voluntary) instance, by which images are recalled from [[Long-term memory|long-term]] or [[short-term memory]], or created from fantasy, or a combination of both, in response to guidance, instruction, or supervision. Guided imagery is therefore the assisted simulation or re-creation of perceptual experience across sensory modalities.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn S.M., Ganis G., Thompson W.L. Neural foundations of imagery.

In [[Experimental psychology|experimental]] and [[cognitive psychology]], researchers have concentrated primarily on voluntary and deliberately generated imagery, which the participant or patient creates, inspects, and transforms, such as by evoking imagery of an [[Intimidation|intimidating]] social event, and transforming the images into those indicative of a pleasant and [[Self-affirmation|self-affirming]] experience.

In [[psychopathology]], clinicians have typically focused on involuntary imagery which "comes to mind" unbidden, such as in a [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] person's experience of intrusive unwelcome negative images indicative of sadness, hopelessness, and morbidity;&lt;ref&gt;'''Souces''':

In clinical practice and psychopathology, involuntary mental images are considered intrusive when they occur unwanted and unbidden, "hijacking attention" to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, D., Involuntary memories of emotional events: Do memories of traumas and extremely happy events differ? Applied Cognitive Psychology, Vol.15, No. 7, 2001, S135–S158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, I. A., Holmes, E. A., and Mackay, C. A., Intrusive imagery and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: An experimental psychopathology approach to flashbacks. In A. Mishara, P. Corlett, P. Fletcher and M. Schwartz (Eds.), Phenomenological neuropsychiatry: The patient's experience, bridging clinic with clinical neuroscience: Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The maintenance of, or "holding in mind" imagery, whether voluntary or involuntary, places considerable demands upon cognitive [[Attentional control|attentional resources]], including [[working memory]], redirecting them away from a specific cognitive task or general-purpose concentration and toward the imagery.

In clinical practice, this process can be positively exploited [[Therapy|therapeutically]] by training the participant or patient to focus attention on a significantly demanding task, which successfully competes for and directs attention away from the unbidden intrusive imagery, decreasing its intensity, vividness, and duration, and consequently alleviating distress or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;Bexton, W. H., Heron, W., and Scott, T. H., Effects of decreased variation in the sen-sory environment. Canadian Journal of Psychology, Vol. 8, No. 2, 1954, pp70–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engelhard, I. M., van den Hout, M. A., and Smeets, M. A. M., Taxing working mem- ory reduces vividness and emotional intensity of images about the Queen's Day tragedy. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2011, pp32–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental imagery and ill health==

Mental imagery, especially visual and auditory imagery, can exacerbate and aggravate a number of mental and physical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Arntz, A., Imagery rescripting as a therapeutic technique: Review of clinical trials, basic studies, and research agenda. Journal of Experimental Psychopathology, Vol. 3, 2012, pp121–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, according to the principles of [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]], the way an individual perceives his or her mental and physical condition in turn affects [[Homeostasis|biological processes]], including susceptibility to [[illness]], [[infection]], or [[disease]]; and that perception is derived significantly from mental imagery. That is to say that in some cases, the severity of an individual's mental and physical [[disability]], [[Disease#Terminology|disorder]], or [[Disease#Terminology|illness]] is partially determined by his or her images, including their content, vividness or intensity, clarity, and frequency with which they are experienced as intrusive and unbidden.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

An individual can aggravate the [[symptom]]s and intensify the pain or distress precipitated by many conditions through generating, often involuntarily, mental imagery that emphasizes its severity.

For example, mental imagery has been shown to play a key role in contributing to, exacerbating, or intensifying the experience and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

==Example conditions aggravated by mental imagery==

The aforementioned challenges and difficulties are some of those for which there is evidence to show that an individual can aggravate the symptoms and intensify the pain or distress precipitated by the condition through generating mental imagery that emphasizes its severity.

The following elaborates the way in which such mental imagery contributes to or aggravates four specific conditions:

# [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]]
# [[Social anxiety]]
# [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
# [[Bipolar disorder]]

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===

Posttraumatic stress disorder often proceeds from experiencing or witnessing a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] involving [[death]], serious [[injury]], or significant [[threat]] to others or oneself;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Text revision (4th ed.). Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and disturbing intrusive images, often described by the patient as 'flashbacks', are a common symptom of this condition across demographics of age, gender, and the nature of the precipitating traumatic event.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

===Social anxiety===

Individuals with social anxiety have a higher than normal tendency to [[fear]] situations that involve public attention, such as speaking to an audience or being interviewed, meeting people with whom they are unfamiliar, and attending events of an unpredictable nature.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Text revision (4th ed.). Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As with posttraumatic stress disorder, vivid mental imagery is a common experience for those with social anxiety, and often comprises images that revive and replay a previously experienced [[Stress (psychology)|stressful]], intimidating or harrowing event that precipitated negative feelings, such as [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], or awkwardness.&lt;ref&gt;Libby, L. K., Valenti, G., Pfent, A., and Eibach, R. P. (2011). Seeing failure in your life: Imagery perspective determines whether self-esteem shapes reactions to recalled and imagined failure.

Recurrent images and early memories in social phobia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, Vol. 38, No. 6, pp601–610.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby, mental imagery contributes to the maintenance and persistence of social anxiety, as it does with posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. M., and Wells, A. (1995). A cognitive model of social phobia. In R. G. Heimberg, M. Liebowitz, D. Hope, and F. Schneier (Eds.), Social phobia: Diagnosis, assessment and treatment, pp69–93.

Behaviour Research and Therapy, Vol. 35, 1997, pp741–756.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the mental imagery commonly described by those suffering from social anxiety often comprises what [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] describe as an "observer perspective". This consists of an [[Self image|image of themselves]], as though from an observing person's [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]], in which those [[suffering]] from social anxiety [[Self-perception theory|perceive themselves]] negatively, as if from that observing person's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Wells, Costas Papageorgiou, The observer perspective: biased imagery in social phobia, agoraphobia, and blood/injury phobia, Behaviour Research and Therapy, Vol. 37, No. 7, July 1999, pp 653-658,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, A., Clark, D. M., and McManus, F., Recurrent images and early memories in social phobia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, Vol. 38, No. 6, 2000, pp601–610.&lt;/ref&gt; Such imagery is also common among those suffering from other types of [[anxiety]], who often have depleted ability to generate neutral, positive, or pleasant imagery.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

Behavioral and Cognitive Psychotherapy, Vol. 40, No. 1, 2012, pp55–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===

The capacity to evoke pleasant and positively [[Self affirmation|affirming]] imagery, either voluntarily or involuntarily, may be a critical requisite for precipitating and sustaining positive [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] or feelings and [[optimism]]; and this ability is often impaired in those suffering from depression.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, E. A., Coughtrey, A. E., and Connor, A., Looking at or through rose-tinted glasses? Imagery perspective and positive mood. Emotion, Vol. 8, No. 6, 2008, pp875–879.&lt;/ref&gt; Depression consists of emotional distress and [[Cognition|cognitive impairment]] that may include feelings of hopelessness, pervasive sadness, [[pessimism]], lack of [[motivation]], [[Solitude|social withdrawal]], difficulty in [[Attentional control|concentrating]] on mental or physical tasks, and [[Insomnia|disrupted sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Text revision (4th ed.). Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst depression is frequently associated with negative rumination of verbal thought patterns manifested as unspoken [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]],&lt;ref&gt;Fresco, D.

==Principles==
The therapeutic use of guided imagery, as part of a multimodal treatment plan incorporating other suitable methods, such as [[guided meditation]], [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], and [[relaxation technique]]s, as well as [[physical medicine and rehabilitation]], and [[psychotherapy]], aims to educate the patient in altering their mental imagery, replacing images that compound pain, recollect and reconstruct distressing events, intensify feelings of hopelessness, or reaffirm debilitation, with those that emphasize physical comfort, functional capacity, mental [[equanimity]], and optimism.

Whether the guided imagery is provided in person by a facilitator, or delivered via [[Digital media|media]], the [[Speech|verbal]] instruction consists of words, often pre-scripted, intended to direct the participant's [[Attentional control|attention]] to imagined visual, auditory, [[Somatosensory system|tactile]], gustatory or olfactory [[Sensory system|sensations]] that precipitate a positive psychologic and [[Physiology|physiologic]] response that incorporates increased mental and physical relaxation and decreased mental and physical stress.

Guided imagery is one of the means by which therapists, teachers, or practitioners seek to achieve this outcome, and involves encouraging patients or participants to imagine alternative [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspectives]], thoughts, and behaviors, mentally rehearsing strategies that they may subsequently actualize, thereby developing increased [[Coping (psychology)|coping skills and ability]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang P. J., A bio-informational theory of emotional imagery. Psychophysiology, Vo.17, 1979, pp179–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image maintenance===

Image maintenance involves the volitional sustaining or maintaining of imagery, without which, a mental image is subject to rapid [[Decay theory|decay]] with an average duration of only 250ms.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Image and brain: The resolution of the imagery debate. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because volitionally created mental images usually fade rapidly once generated in order to avoid disrupting or confusing the process of ordinary sensory perception.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Image and mind. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Seeing and imagining in the cerebral hemispheres: a computational approach. Psychological review, Vol. 94, No. 2, 1987, p148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Thompson, W. L., and Ganis, G. (2006). The case for mental imagery. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural brief duration of mental imagery means that the active maintenance stage of guided imagery, which is necessary for the subsequent stages of inspection and transformation, requires cognitive concentration of attention by the participant. This [[Attentional control|concentrative attentional ability]] can be improved with the practice of mental exercises, including those derived from guided meditation and supervised [[Meditation|meditative praxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Salway, A. F. S., and Logie, R. H., Visuo-spatial working memory, movement con- trol, and executive demands. British Journal of Psychology, Vol. 86, 1995, pp253–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, D.

(1988). Measuring the temporal characteristics of visual im- ages. Journal of Mental Imagery, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp89–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cocude, M., Charlot, V., and Denis, M., Latency and duration of visual mental im- ages in normal and depressed subjects.

Memory, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1999, pp19–41.&lt;/ref&gt; not only for imagery created through fantasy&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, D. G., Mental imagery and creative thought. Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. 147, 2007, pp187–212.&lt;/ref&gt; but also for mental images generated from both long-term memory&lt;ref&gt;Cocude, M., and Denis, M. (1988). Measuring the temporal characteristics of visual im- ages. Journal of Mental Imagery, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp89–101.&lt;/ref&gt; and short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M. J., Peynircioglu, Z. F., and Brems, D. J., Pictorial rehearsal. Memory and Cognition, Vol. 12, No. 6, 1984, pp553–557.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, while the majority of the research literature has tended to focus on the maintenance of visual mental images, imagery in other sensory modalities also necessitates a volitional maintenance process in order for further inspection or transformation to be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Zatorre, R. J., Halpern, A. R., and Bouffard, M., Mental reversal of imagined melodies: A role for the posterior parietal cortex. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Vol. 22, No. 4, 2010, pp775–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requisite for practice in sustaining [[attentional control]], such that attention remains focused on maintaining generated imagery, is one of the reasons that guided meditation, which supports such concentration, is often integrated into the provision of guided imagery as part of the intervention. Guided meditation assists participants in extending the duration for which generated mental images are maintained, providing time to inspect the imagery, and proceed to the final transformation stage of guided imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Seeing and imagining in the cerebral hemispheres: a computational approach. Psychological review, Vol. 94, No. 2, 1987, p148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Thompson, W. L., and Ganis, G., The case for mental imagery. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image inspection===

Once generated and maintained, a mental image can be inspected to provide the basis for interpretation, and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Ganis, G., and Thompson, W. L. (2001). Neural foundations of imagery. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Vol. 2, No. 9, pp635–642.&lt;/ref&gt; For visual imagery, inspection often involves a scanning process, by which the participant directs attention across and around an image, simulating shifts in perceptual perspective.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

The role of visual experience in mental scanning of actual pathways: Evidence from blind and sighted people. Perception, Vol. 39, No. 7, pp953–969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image transformation===

Finally, with the assistance of verbal instruction from the guided imagery practitioner or teacher, the participant transforms, modifies, or alters the content of generated mental imagery, in such a way as to substitute images that provoke negative feelings, are indicative of suffering, or that reaffirm disability or debilitation for those that elicit positive emotion, and are suggestive of resourcefulness, ability to cope, and an increased degree of mental and physical capacity.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

This process shares principles with those that inform the [[clinical psychology]] techniques of "imagery restructuring" or "imagery re-scripting" as used in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Arntz, A., Imagery rescripting as a therapeutic technique: Review of clinical trials, basic studies, and research agenda. Journal of Experimental Psychopathology, Vol. 3, 2012, pp121–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagenaars, M. A., Brewin, C. R., van Minnen, A., Holmes, E. A., and Hoogduin, K. A. L. (2010).

R., Imagery rescripting in cognitive behaviour therapy: Images, treatment techniques and outcomes. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, Vol. 38, No. 4, 2007, pp297–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of research findings on image transformation relate to visual mental imagery, there is evidence to support transformations in other sensory modalities such as auditory imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Zatorre, R. J., Halpern, A. R., and Bouffard, M., Mental reversal of imagined melodies: A role for the posterior parietal cortex. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Vol. 22, No. 4, 2010, pp775–789.&lt;/ref&gt; and haptic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Miquée, A., Xerri, C., Rainville, C., Anton, J.

Neuroscience, Vol. 152, No. 1,2008, pp29-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcome of image generation, maintenance, inspection, and transformation===

Through this technique, a patient is assisted in reducing the tendency to evoke images indicative of the distressing, painful, or debilitative nature of a condition, and learns instead to evoke mental imagery of their identity, body, and circumstances that emphasizes the capacity for [[autonomy]] and [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]], positive proactive activity, and the ability to cope, whilst managing their condition.

As a result, symptoms become less incapacitating, pain is to some degree decreased, while coping skills increase.&lt;ref&gt;van den Hout, M. A., Engelhard, I. M., Beetsma, D., Slofstra, C., Hornsveld, H., Houtveen, J., and Leer, A., EMDR and mindfulness.

R., Imagery rescripting in cognitive behavior therapy: Images, treatment techniques and outcomes.

A., Mathews, A., Dalgleish, T., and Mackintosh, B., Positive interpretation training: Effects of mental imagery versus verbal training on positive mood. Behavior Therapy, Vol. 37, No. 3, 2006, pp237–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requisite for absorption==

In order for the foregoing process to take place effectively, such that all four stages of guided imagery are completed with therapeutic beneficial effect, the patient or participant must be capable of or susceptible to [[Absorption (psychology)|absorption]], which is an "openness to absorbing and self-altering experiences".&lt;ref&gt;Tellegen, A., and Atkinson, G., Openness to absorbing and self-altering experiences (absorption), a trait related to hypnotic susceptibility. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol. 83, No. 3, 1974, pp268–277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tellegen, A., A brief manual for the differential personality questionnaire. Minneapolis: Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a further reason why guided meditation or some form of meditative praxis, relaxation techniques, and [[meditation music]] or receptive music therapy are often combined with or form an integral part of the operational and practical use of the guided imagery intervention. For, all those techniques can increase the participant's or patient's capacity for or susceptibility to absorption, thereby increasing the potential efficacy of guided imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, K., Ospina, M.

The United States [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH), which is among twenty-seven organizations that make up the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), classifies guided imagery and guided meditation, as [[mind–body interventions]], one of five domains of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered part of conventional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;US National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health Collection Development Manual. Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 8 October 2003. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html Online Version.] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCCIH defines mind-body interventions as those practices that "employ a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms", and include guided imagery, guided meditation and forms of meditative praxis, [[hypnosis]] and [[hypnotherapy]], prayer, as well as [[art therapy]], music therapy, and [[dance therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, S. E., Expanding Horizons of Healthcare: Five Year Strategic Plan 2001–2005. 25 September 2000. US Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service. National Institutes of Health. NIH Publication No. 01-5001. [https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/about/plans/fiveyear/fiveyear.pdf Online Version] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

All mind–body interventions, including the aforementioned, focus on the interaction between the [[brain]], body, and behavior and are practiced with intention to use the mind to alter physical function and promote overall health and [[Well-being|wellbeing]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, G., Fisher, W., and Johnson, A., Mind–body therapies in integrative oncology. In Current Treatment Options in Oncology, Vol. 11, Nos. 3-4, 2010, pp128-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, L.S., Manheimer E., Berman B.M., Development and classification of an operational definition of complementary and alternative medicine for the Cochrane Collaboration. Alternative therapies in health and medicine, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2011, pp50-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documented benefits of mind-body interventions derived from scientific research firstly into their use in contributing to the treatment a range of conditions including [[headache]]s, [[coronary artery disease]] and [[Chronic condition|chronic pain]]; secondly in ameliorating the symptoms of [[Chemotherapy | chemotherapy-induced]] [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and localised physical pain in patients with [[cancer]]; thirdly in increasing the perceived capacity to cope with significant problems and challenges; and fourthly in improving the reported overall [[Quality of life|quality-of-life]]. In addition, there is evidence supporting the brain and [[Central nervous system|central nervous system's]] influence on the [[immune system]] and the capacity for mind-body interventions to enhance immune function outcomes, including defense against and recovery from infection and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, E., Pittler, M.H., Wider, B., and Boddy, K., Mind-body therapies: are the trial data getting stronger?

Neurology, Vol. 70, No. 24, 2008, pp2321–2328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mundy, E.A,. DuHamel, K.N., Montgomery, G. H., The efficacy of behavioral interventions for cancer treatment-related side effects.

R., Human psychoneuroimmunology: 20 years of discovery. Brain, Behavior and Immunity, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2008, pp129-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided imagery has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing postoperative discomfort as well as [[chronic condition|chronic]] pain related to cancer, [[arthritis]], and physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, S. D., and Yucha, C. B., Relaxation and Pain Management: The relaxation response can play a role in managing chronic and acute pain.

==Evidence and explanation==

Evidence and explanations for the effectiveness and limitations of [[creative visualization]] come from two discreet sources: cognitive psychology and psychoneuroimmunology.

===Cognitive psychology===

Guided imagery is employed as an adjunctive technique to psychological therapies in the treatment of many conditions, including those identified in the previous sections. It plays a significant role in the application of cognitive approaches to psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], [[schema therapy]], and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, J., Guided imagery. Alternative and complementary therapies, Vol. 14, No. 6, 2008, pp295-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

These therapies derive from or draw substantially upon a model of mental functioning initially established by [[Aaron T. Beck]], a psychiatrist and [[psychoanalyst]] who posited that the subjective way in which people perceive themselves and interpret experiences influences their emotional, behavioral, and physiological reactions to circumstances. He additionally discovered that by assisting patients in correcting their [[Cognitive distortion|misperceptions and misinterpretations]], and aiding them in modifying unhelpful and self-deprecating ways of thinking about themselves and their predicament, his patients had more productive reactions to events, and developed a more positive [[self-concept]], [[self-image]], or perception of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

This use of guided imagery is based on the following premise. Everyone participates in both the voluntary and involuntary spontaneous generation of visual, auditory and other mental images, which is a necessary part of the way in which a person solves problems, recollects the past, predicts and plans the future, and formulates their self-perception, self-image, or the way they 'view' and perceive themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, D. G., Mental imagery and creative thought. Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. 147, 2007, pp187–212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, K., Sheehan, P. W., and Ashton, R., Imagery assessment: A survey of self-report measures. Journal of Mental Imagery, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1977, pp145–169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvinue, L. P., and Robertson, I. H., Measuring visual imagery ability: A review. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, Vol. 26, No. 3, 2007, pp191–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this self-image can be altered and self-regulated with the aid of mind-body interventions including guided imagery, by which an individual changes the way he or she visualizes, imagines, and [[Self perception theory|perceives themselves]] generally, and their physical condition, [[body image]], and mental state specifically.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

Biological psychiatry, Vol. 52, No. 4, 2002, pp305-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoneuroimmunology===
{{main|Psychoneuroimmunology}}
The term "psychoneuroimmunology" was coined by American psychologist [[Robert Ader]] in 1981 to describe the study of interactions between psychological, neurological, and immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R., A historical account of conditioned immunobiologic responses. In R. Ader (Ed.), Psvchoneuroimmunology, pp321-352. New York: Academic Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, [[Jean Achterberg]] published a book called ''Imagery in Healing'' that sought to relate and correlate contemporaneous evidence from the then emerging scientific study of the way mental processes influence physical and physiological function, with particular emphasis on mental imagery, to the [[folklore]] she extrapolated from a set of diverse ancient and geographically indigenous practices previously described as '[[shamanism]]' by the historian of religion and professor at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Mircea Eliade]]; and a number of [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Achterburg, J., Imagery in Healing; Shamanism and Modern Medicine. Boston: New Science Library, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental hypothesis of psychoneuroimmunology is concisely that the way people think and how they feel directly influences the [[electrochemistry]] of the brain and central nervous system, which in turn has a significant influence on the immune system and its capacity to defend the body against disease, infection, and ill health. Meanwhile, the immune system affects [[neurochemistry|brain chemistry]] and its electrical activity, which in turn has a considerable impact on the way we think and feel.&lt;ref&gt;Borysenko, J., Psychoneuroimmunology: behavioral factors and the immune response. ReVision, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1984, pp56-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this interplay, a person's negative thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, such as pessimistic predictions about the future, regretful ruminations upon the past, low self-esteem, and depleted belief in self-determination and a capacity to cope can undermine the efficiency of the immune system, increasing vulnerability to ill health. Simultaneously, the biochemical indicators of ill health monitored by the immune system feeds back to the brain via the nervous system, which exacerbates thoughts and feelings of a negative nature. That is to say, we feel and think of ourselves as unwell, which contributes to physical conditions of ill health, which in turn cause us to feel and think of ourselves as unwell.&lt;ref&gt;Borysenko, J., Minding the Body, Mending the Mind. MA: Addison-Wesley, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the interplay between cognitive and emotional, neurological, and immunological processes also provides for the possibility of positively influencing the body and enhancing physical health by changing the way we think and feel. For example, people who are able to deconstruct the cognitive distortions that precipitate perpetual pessimism and hopelessness and further develop the capacity to perceive themselves as having a significant degree of self-determination and capacity to cope are more likely to avoid and recover from ill health more quickly than those who remain engaged in negative thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, E., The Psychobioloqy of Mind-Body Healing. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

This simplification of a complex interaction of interrelated systems and the capacity of the mind to influence the body does not account for the significant influence that other factors have on mental and physical well-being, including exercise, diet, and [[Social relation|social interaction]].

Nonetheless, in helping people to make such changes to their habitual thought processes and pervasive feelings, mind-body interventions, including creative visualization, when provided as part of a multimodal and interdisciplinary treatment program of other methods, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, have been shown to contribute significantly to treatment of and recovery from a range of conditions.

In addition, there is evidence supporting the brain and central nervous system's influence on the immune system and the capacity for mind-body interventions to enhance immune function outcomes, including defense against and recovery from infection and disease.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

'''Gunnar Alksnis''' (July 1, 1931&amp;nbsp;– May 15, 2011) was a [[Latvian Americans|Latvian-American]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] who was specialized in ethics and history of philosophy.

== Biography ==
Alksnis was born as '''Gunārs Alksnis''' on July 1, 1931, in [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]]. His parents were John Edward Alksnis and Elza Alksnis. The Alksnis family came to the United States in 1949. In 1955 Gunnar Alksnis received a [[Bachelor of divinity]] degree. One year later he was ordained as a minister of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] at  Trinity Church in [[Russell County, Kansas]]. He married Pauline Elizabeth Krug (1933-2014) in 1957. The couple had two children, John Albert and Maria.

In 1965 Gunnar Alksnis received the academic degree of a [[Master of Sacred Theology]]. He became Ph.D. at [[Kansas State University]] after submitting a thesis on the critique of rationalism in the German [[Lebensphilosophie]] in 1970. In 1968 Gunnar Alksnis was appointed Professor at [[Washburn University]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. For more than 30 years he taught history of philosophy and theology.

After his retirement in 2000 Gunnar and Pauline Alksnis moved to [[Woodland, California]]. He continued to write and actively worked for churches in woodland and [[Davis, California|Davis]] giving lectures on [[Martin Luther]] and the Reformation. His articles touch upon a diversity of topics including history, religion and philosophy. He died on May 15, 2011, in Woodland.

== Research interests ==
Gunnar Alksnis was interested in the history of [[Actuarial science]]. He was a specialist on [[:de:August Zillmer|August Zillmer]] (1831-1893), who first proposed the variation of preliminary term reserves in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Alksnis and William Roach: August Zillmer, an actuary with less reserve. ''The Actuary''. March 1989 – Volume 23, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alksnis was most interested in the philosophy of [[Ludwig Klages]] who drew a distinction between life-affirming ''Seele'' (soul) and life-destroying ''Geist'' (spirit/mind) as the forces of "modern, industrial, and intellectual rationalization."&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Alksnis: ''Ludwig Klages and His Attack on Rationalism''. Kansas State University, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after Alksnis death his PhD thesis from 1970 was finally published under the title ''Chthonic Gnosis. Ludwig Klages and his Quest for the Pandaemonic All''.&lt;ref&gt;Theion Publishing: [http://www.theionpublishing.com/books/chthonic-gnosis-klages], ''Chthonic Gnosis. Ludwig Klages and his Quest for the Pandaemonic All'' by Dr. Gunnar Alksnis, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnar Alksnis tried to explain history through biography, because he thought that the unsurpassed way to comprehend an era is to understand the life and profiles of its leaders.

== Honours ==
In memory of Gunnar Alksnis Washburn University established the “Prof. Gunnar Alksnis History Scholarship”.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ichabod''. Washburn University, December 2011, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This scholarship is awarded to students “with demonstrated enthusiasm for scholarly activity in History.“&lt;ref&gt;Washburn University: [http://www.washburn.edu/academics/college-schools/arts-sciences/departments/history/scholarships.html Scholarships &amp; Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inductionism''' is the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] where laws are "[[induction (philosophy)|induced]]" from sets of data.  As an example, one might measure the strength of electrical forces at varying distances from charges and induce the [[inverse square law]] of [[electrostatics]].

'''John Leslie Mackie''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (25 August 1917&amp;nbsp;– 12 December 1981), was an Australian philosopher, originally from Sydney. He made significant contributions to the [[philosophy of religion]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], and is perhaps best known for his views on [[meta-ethics]], especially his defence of [[moral scepticism]].

He authored six books. His most widely known, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977), opens by boldly stating that "There are no objective values." It goes on to argue that because of this ethics must be invented, rather than discovered.

==Life==
Mackie was born 25 August 1917 in [[Killara]], Sydney.&lt;ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mackie-john-leslie-14214|title= Mackie, John Leslie (1917–1981)|last= Menzies| first= Peter |date= |website= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher= [[Australian National University]]| accessdate= 7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Annie Burnett Duncan, was a schoolteacher,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and his father, Alexander Mackie, was professor of education at the [[University of Sydney]] as well as the principal of the [[Sydney Teachers College]], and was influential in the educational system of [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt; He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1938 after studying under [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]], sharing the medal in philosophy with eminent jurist [[Harold Glass]]. Mackie received the Wentworth Travelling Fellowship to study [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] Mackie served with the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] in the Middle East and Italy, and was [[mentioned in dispatches]].&lt;ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography"/&gt; He was professor of philosophy at the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand from 1955 to 1959 and succeeded Anderson as the [[Challis Professor]] of Philosophy at the University of Sydney from 1959 to 1963. In 1963, he moved to the United Kingdom, becoming the inaugural holder of the chair of philosophy in the [[University of York]], a position he held until 1967 when he was instead elected a fellow of [[University College, Oxford]], where he served as [[praelector]]. In 1969, he gave a lecture entitled 'What’s Really Wrong with Phenomenalism?' at the [[British Academy]] as part of its annual Philosophical Lectures series.&lt;ref name="British Academy Philosophical Lectures"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britac.ac.uk/node/3555/ |title= Philosophical Lectures|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= www.britac.ac.uk/|publisher= [[British Academy]] | accessdate=  7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he became a fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt;

He died in Oxford on 12 December 1981.&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt;

===Character and family===
Mackie is said to have been capable of expressing total disagreement in such a genial way that the person being addressed might mistake the comment for a compliment.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary notice, ''University College Record'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; This personal style is exemplified by the following words from the preface to Mackie's ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977, p.&amp;nbsp;3):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am nowhere mainly concerned to refute any individual writer. I believe that all those to whom I have referred, even those with whom I disagree most strongly, have contributed significantly to our understanding of ethics: where I have quoted their actual words, it is because they have presented views or arguments more clearly or more forcefully than I could put them myself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mackie married Joan Meredith in 1947. One of Mackie's three daughters, [[Penelope Mackie]], also became a philosopher. She lectured in Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]] from 1994 to 2004, and was appointed Head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 2007. Mackie's younger son, David, is also a philosopher and graduated from Oxford University where he held lectureships at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] before being appointed a Fellow and Tutor at [[Oriel College]]. {{As of|2013}} he teaches at [[D'Overbroeck's College]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doverbroecks.com/staff/ D'Overbroeck's College Teaching Staff] at official website. Accessed 12 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's other daughter, Hilary, is a classicist at Rice University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ces.rice.edu/faculty/hilary-mackie] Faculty website. Accessed 26 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Mackie is best known for his contributions to the fields of [[meta-ethics]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[metaphysics]].  In meta-ethics, he took a position called [[moral scepticism]], arguing against the objective existence of ''right'' and ''wrong'' as intrinsically normative entities on fundamental grounds as unsure about what kinds of things such entities would be, if they existed.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Mackie 1977: [[Argument from Queerness]]. ''The Argument from Queerness also suggests that the only way to know of such entities would be through an intuition or another faculty different from how we know everything else. He conjoined moral scepticism with [[error theory]], holding that moral judgments, while cognitive, are all false since there are no moral properties about which our moral judgments could be correct.''&lt;/ref&gt;

His perhaps most widely known work,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'', bluntly begins with the opening sentence "There are no objective values". He uses several arguments to support this claim that objective values are false.  He argues that some aspects of moral thought are relative, and that objective morals require an absurd intrinsic action-guiding feature.  Most of all, he thinks it is very unclear how objective values could supervene on features of the natural world (see the ''[[Argument from queerness]]'').  Fourth, he thinks it would be difficult to justify our knowledge of "value entities" or account for any links or consequences they would have.  And, finally, he thinks it is possible to show that even without any objective values, people would still have reason to firmly believe in them (hence, he claims that it is possible for people to be mistaken or fooled into believing that objective values exist). ''[[The Times]]'' called the book "a lucid discussion of moral theory which, although aimed at the general reader, has attracted a good deal of professional attention."&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt;

[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|Mackie was a supporter of the [[compatibilism|compatibilistic]] interpretation of [[free will]].]]
Concerning religion, he was well known for vigorously defending [[atheism]], and also arguing that the [[problem of evil]] made untenable the main [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Mackie 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; His criticisms of the [[free will]] defence are particularly significant. He argued that the idea of human free will is no defense for those who wish to believe in an omnicompetent being in the face of evil and suffering, as such a being could have given us both free will and moral perfection, thus resulting in us choosing the good in every situation.  In 1955 he published one of his &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ditext.com/mackie/evil.html&lt;/ref&gt; "Evil and Omnipotence", summarizing his view that the simultaneous existence of evil and an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-good God was "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie1955"/&gt; Mackie's views on this so-called [[Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil|logical problem of evil]] prompted [[Alvin Plantinga]] to respond with his version of the [[Plantinga's free will defense|Free Will Defense]] to which Mackie later responded in his ''The Miracle of Theism''.

In metaphysics, Mackie made significant contributions relating to the nature of [[causality (physics)|causal relationships]], especially regarding conditional statements describing them (see, for example, Mackie 1974){{citation needed|reason=no citation given||date=March 2016}} and the notion of an [[INUS]] condition.

Upon being given a copy of [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as a Christmas present,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; he in 1978 wrote an article in the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' praising the book and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy.&lt;ref name="Philosophy1978"/&gt; Philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] responded in 1979 with "Gene-Juggling", an article arguing that ''The Selfish Gene'' was about [[psychological egoism]], rather than [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy1979"/&gt; This started a dispute between Mackie, Midgley, and Dawkins that was still ongoing at the time of Mackie's death.

[[File:JamesBoeveyPortraitFlaxleyCollection.jpg|thumb|200px| Portrait of James Boevey (1622–1696) aged 11, inscribed: "James Boevey An(n)o Dom(ini): 1634 Aetatis Suae 11 ("A.D. 1634 of his age 11"). In 1973 the painting was in the collection of Mr F.B.Watkins, owner of Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire. An inferior 19th-century copy was painted and published in Crawley-Boevey, A.W.C., The Perverse Widow (1898). MacDermot, E.T. stated: "The original canvas shows only that it was painted in 1634 when its subject was eleven years old, the title being added later. This led Mr Crawley-Boevey to suggest (in his "Notes on the Antiquities at Flaxley Abbey" (1912)) that the portrait was of Boevey's nephew, Abraham Clarke, who was eleven in the latter part of 1634. He overlooked the fact that James Boevey's twelfth birthday was not until 7 May 1634 and the family tradition has always been that it is a companion portrait to that of his sister Joanna, painted when she was eleven in 1616. It is listed as such in the family records and undoubtedly portrays Boevey"&lt;ref&gt;MacDermot, Edward T., The History of the Forest of Exmoor, Revised Edition, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''James Boevey''' (1622–1696) (pronounced "Boovey")&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, Crawley-Boevey Baronets, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; was an English merchant, lawyer and philosopher of Huguenot parentage.

==Origins==
He was born in London at 6 a.m. on 7 May 1622 in Mincing Lane, in the parish of St. Dunstan-in-the-East. He was the youngest son of Andreas Boevey (c. 1566–1625) by his second wife Joanna der Wilde (d.1644), daughter of Peter der Wilde. Andreas Boevey was a Dutch [[Huguenot]] from [[Courtrai]] in Flanders&lt;ref&gt;Crawley-Boevey, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; who had been brought to England aged 7 by his Huguenot parents following the invasion of the Low Countries by the [[Duke of Alva]] and the Duke's subsequent persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, James. History of the Siderfin Family of West Somerset, Exeter, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas had nine children by his first wife Esther Fenn and two by his second wife, the eldest of whom was James.  James's mother remarried in 1628 Johannes van Abeele, a widower and member of the Dutch emigree community in [[Norwich]]

==Education==
He was educated at the [[Mercers' School]] in London, where his tutor was Mr Augur. In 1631 he went to the Netherlands to complete his schooling in Latin and Greek. In 1636 he embarked on a "[[grand tour]]" of Europe to perfect his cultural education.

==Career==

===Mercantile career===
Boevey started his career working for the Dutch-born financier Sir [[William Courten]] (d.1636), discoverer of [[Barbados]]. Boeve married in 1638 Susanna Dwyer, the niece of John Money, Courten's business partner in the great firm of silk and linen merchants Courten and Money.  He then worked as cashier for the banker Dierik Hoste, and also for the Spanish Ambassador in London.

===Agent for exiled King Charles II===
During the [[Commonwealth]] whilst [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was in exile on the continent, James Boevey was described in a petition later made by his son-in-law Captain William Hinton as: "Mr James Boeve of Middleburg in [[Zeeland]]... the person through whom most of the King's business passed during his exile, a duty which he fulfilled with integrity and with expense even to ruin. Yet he never asked reward, and declared that he would be satisfied if his son-in-law obtained the Government of Newfoundland".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Hinton, Margie, as "Colonial  Papers, Vol. XLVII, nos 15, 15 I-V",  &amp; Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies: 1681–1685, Vol. 11 (1898), pp.65–80 [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=69848&amp;strquery=Boeve]&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton was later appointed Governor of Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1667–68, p.557: "The Ship Adventurer with Mr William Hinton Jnr. appointed Governor of Newfoundland put into Weymouth Road August 27, 1668, from Barbados"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jailed by States of Zealand===
The following record dated 29 June 1672 from the Calendar of Treasury Books explains the circumstances of Boevey's jail sentence in Zealand:&lt;ref&gt;From:  29 June 1672 ('Entry Book: June 1672', Calendar of Treasury Books, Volume 3: 1669–1672 (1908), pp. 1246–1264. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=79764&amp;strquery=Bovey]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Representation to the King from the Treasury Lords concerning the case of Mr. James Bovey (Bovy), referred to said Lords by the order of Council of March 22 last, to hear and examine, in order to your Majesty's insisting upon reasonable satisfaction for your said injured subject when it shall be reasonable. Said James Boeve, merchant of London, married Susanna Dwyer, the daughter of John Moneye['s] only sister, who died in 1631 at Middleburg in Zealand, and left said Susanna a legacy of £2,000, as likewise the same legacy to the other sister Hester, who was married to John White and received her legacy from Sir William Courteen, who with one Boudean [Bowden], the son of Peter Bouden (whose window Money married), was left executor. When James Boven came to demand his legacy in the right of Susanna, his wife, Bowden, the other executor, who had drawn the most part of the estate into his hands, delayed him payment for four or five years with fair speeches. At last Boeve, finding himself abused, commenced his suit at Middleburg and obtained sentence for the payment of the legacy and interest. For the execution of this sentence he solicited a long time, but although your Majesty wrote in 1660, Aug. 15 to the States of Zealand that he might have the benefit of the sentence, yet nothing was done therein. By the law and custom there, there is no appeal to the High Court of Justice before such sentence given be performed, yet, notwithstanding, an appeal to the Great Council at the Hague was obtained and hath there depended ever since, your Majesty's letter to the States General demanding justice to be done to the said Boeve and the frequent solicitations of your minister for the expedition thereof being not at all regarded, but he hath been still delayed and denied having any end thereof. And not only was this injustice used towards the said Boeve but also they found means by false suggestions and pretences of debt, by a sentence of the Court of Admiralty of Zealand, to throw the said Boeve in prison without being heard by himself or his attorney, and continued all these injuries and injustices by the practice of the said Peter Bowden, who is a Comr. in the [[East India Company]], although it appeared by an Act in the said court that the said suggestions and pretences are false. By all which said Boeve has been damaged above £20,000, besides the utter ruin of his credit and trade by being detained three years in prison. We represent his condition to your Majesty as a suitable time for your Majesty to insist on reparation for him by recommending his case to the [[Duke of Buckingham]] and the [[Earl of Arlington]], Plenipotentiaries now in Holland, the cause being still depending at the Hague before the High Council and not concluded by any treaty with the States General".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legal career===
Boevey withdrew from commerce and studied law at the [[Inner Temple]], to which he was admitted on 10 June 1660. His legal training was largely utilized in launching his own personal law-suits over property in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], Gloucestershire and in the Netherlands.

===Literary career===
Boevey devised what he called "Active Philosophy", which might be described today as "self-help" literature, which he described in a series of volumes, mostly written in 1665 and 1666, which were never published, but circulated amongst his friends. The volumes still extant are:&lt;ref&gt;11 volumes were purchased by the Clark Library, University of California,  in 1960 [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/search?group=Items;idT=6167153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Written before 1692. Boevey presented a copy of this book to the [[Bodleian Library]] when aged 70. The Bodleian catalogue describes its copy: "A note (c. 1700) inserted at the end describes the volume, which consists of lists of numbers without text, perhaps relating to problems of currency, as: ''Mr Boevay's mysterious Book given to the publick library as a great Treasure. He promised to send a Clavis (i.e. key) to it, but is dead''. On the inner back cover is a dedicatory authograph letter, undated, by the author, and a certificate in favour of the book by ''Cowemberg Van Blois of Amsterdam, Algebraical Accountant''."&lt;ref&gt;629. Oxford, Bodleian Library MS. Bodley 947.Paper. 20.1 x 14.2 in., 24 folios [http://www.levity.com/alchemy/almss7.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a friend of [[John Aubrey]], [[John Evelyn]] and of [[Elias Ashmole]], the latter with whom he shared an interest in the [[occult]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] dined with him and in his Diaries noted as follows: "A solicitor and a lawyer and a merchant altogether who hath travelled very much; did talk some things well, only he is a Sir Positive; but talk of travel over the Alps very fine".&lt;ref&gt;Pepys Diaries, Vol.9, p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property acquired==
[[File:Whitehall, Cheam - geograph.org.uk - 32986.jpg|thumb|Whitehall in [[Cheam]], built c. 1500, believed to have been Boevey's residence]]
[[File:Simonsbath House Hote.jpg|thumb|200px|Simonsbath House, built by James Boevey in the centre of Exmoor  Forest beside the [[River Barle]]. On a beam above the old kitchen fireplace is carved the date "1654"]]

===Flaxley Abbey===
With his half-brother William, Boevey purchased [[Flaxley Abbey]] in the [[Forest of Dean]], Gloucestershire.

===Exmoor Forest===
In 1653 he purchased from [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s government the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of the former [[Royal Forest]] of [[Exmoor]] in [[Somerset]], and in 1654 was the first to build a house on the desolate moorland, at a central spot called [[Simonsbath]]. The house stands today, known as [[Simonsbath House]] (now a hotel) , and retains the carved date of "1654" on a beam in the kitchen. He did not persevere long in his residence on Exmoor, and by 1670 he had moved to [[Whitehall, Cheam|Whitehall]],&lt;ref&gt;Crawley-Boevey, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheam]] in [[Surrey]], whilst retaining his financial interest in the income from Exmoor derived from local graziers, whose rents he increased much to their displeasure.

==Marriage &amp; progeny==
James Boevey married thrice. The identity of the mothers of most of his children is known with the exception of "Bateman", a married son named in his will. He married as follows:
*Firstly on 1 May 1638 in [[St Mary-at-Hill]], London, to Suanna Dwyer (d.1649, Middleburg, [[Zeeland]]) or van der Weyer/Weijer, daughter of Andreas van der Weyer by Susanna der Monchy/Money (d.1631) The latter was the only sister of the merchant John Money (d.1632), who had married (as her second husband) Margaret Courten, sister of Sir [[William Courten]] (1572–1636). With Sir William Courten's younger brother Sir Peter Courten, they established the great firm of silk and linen merchants Courten and Money.  Susanna Dwyer, Boevey's wife, was the heiress to £2,000 from her uncle John Money, the business partner of Sir William Courten. The pursuit of this legacy by Boevey led to his imprisonment in the Netherlands. They had two, possibly three, daughters:
**Margarett, baptised 14 April 1639 in [[St Mary-at-Hill]], London
**Hester, baptised 22 September 1640 in St Mary-at-Hill, London
**(?)Elizabeth, who married Captain Sir William Hinton, captain of the ship ''Adventurer'' which traded with [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/h/i/n/Margie-Hinton/FILE/0003text.txt Per research of Margie L. Hinton, ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondly, in about 1653, to Isabella de Visscher (d.post 21/8/1669), daughter of William de Visscher an emigree merchant from [[Emden]]. They had two children:
**William (d.1692) who predeceased his father, married in 1686 [[Catherina Boevey|Catherina Riches]] (1671–1727), daughter of John Riches Esq. [[Catherina Boevey]] was married aged 15 and famously lived a long, virtuous and philanthropic life at [[Flaxley Abbey]] in Gloucestershire.
**Cornelia
*Thirdly, after 1669, to Margaretta Cresset (1638–1714), by whom he had no issue, and who survived him 18 years dying aged 76 as the couple's marble mural monument in the Lumley Chapel by St Dunstan's Church in [[Cheam]] records.

==Portraits==
A portrait of James Boevey was published on page 34 of Crawley-Boevey, A.W.C., The Perverse Widow, Being Passages from the Life of Catharina, Wife of William Boevey, 1898. Also an oil painting portrait is said to exist at Flaxley Abbey.  In appearance he was very short, described by Aubrey as: "5 ft tall, and slenderly built, with  extremely black hair curled at the ends, an equally black beard, and the darkest of eyebrows hovering above dark but sprightly hazel eyes"&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey, John. Brief Lives, Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey Between the Years 1669 and 1696, (Ed. Clark, A,  Vol.1, 1898, p.114)&lt;/ref&gt; In character he was deemed by Aubrey "A person of great temperance and deepe thoughts, and a working head never idle, ever a great lover of Natural Philosophie. From fourteen he had a candle burning by him all night with pen, inke and paper to write downe thoughts as they came into his head, so that he might not loose a thought".

==Death &amp; burial==
He died at [[Cheam]] and was buried on 13 January 1695 as his mural monument&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sic_itur_ad_astra/6267401676/ Image of mural monument, Cheam]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Lumley Chapel]] in the grounds of St Dunstans Church records: "In memory of James Bovey ''(sic)''  Esq.r who was buried near this place Jan.ry ye 13th 1695. And also of Margaretta his wife buried here August ye 3d. 1714 in ye 76th year of her age".

==Will==
The probate transcript of James Boevey's last will and testament, dated 7 William III (i.e. 1694), (day and month apparently omitted or illegible on copy) is held by the [[National Archives]] at [[Kew]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=770082&amp;queryType=1&amp;resultcount=2   Will of James Boevey, catalogue reference "Prob/11/435, image ref 203"]&lt;/ref&gt; In it he leaves all his property to his wife Margaret, and only the small sums of ten pounds each to his son Bateman, otherwise unknown of, and to the latter's wife. His son William had predeceased him in 1692.&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Armorials==
The armorials of James Boevey as painted on his mural monument (impaled with the arms of his wife) in the [[Lumley Chapel]], nr. St Dunstan's Church, [[Cheam]], Surrey are: ''Ermine, on a bend sable three [[bezant]]s''. It is unknown whether this monument has been re-painted or restored. The arms of Boevey are given differently by Cleveland as: ''Or, on a chevron sable three [[Roundel|plates]]''. Furthermore on the 1712 engraving of Flaxley Abbey by [[Johannes Kip]] published in Robert Atkyns' "The Ancient &amp; Present State of Gloucestershire" (published in monochrome &amp; tinted later), when it was the residence of Catherina Boevey, the arms depicted are again different. The grant of arms to Crawley-Boevey is recorded as: ''Ermine, on a bend gules between two martlets sable three guttes d'or''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA179&amp;dq=boevey&amp;ei=SmKZT7mVMIu18QPQhKjpBQ&amp;id=ZEsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=text Gums, Henry H., Gloucestershire Notes &amp; Queries, pp.176–180]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter arms are borne today, but in the form of a chief only above other heraldic elements, by the Crawley-Boevey baronets.&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Brusseau''' is a [[philosopher]] specializing in contemporary [[Continental philosophy]], [[history of philosophy]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunypress.edu/p-2706-isolated-experiences.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Brusseau joined the faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the [[UNAM|Mexican National University]] in Mexico City teaching graduate courses in philosophy and comparative literature. He has also taught in Europe and the [[California State University]]. Currently he teaches at Pace University in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;https://eportfolio.pace.edu/user/view.php?id=13707&lt;/ref&gt; Brusseau took a Ph.D. in Philosophy under the direction of [[Alphonso Lingis]]. He is married to a Spaniard and has two children.

== Scholarship ==
Brusseau's scholarship focuses on philosophical decadence, which he defines as philosophers stepping aside from the task of making accurate theories about the larger world, and instead endeavoring to produce theories that in their turn provoke more theorizing. Within this framework, whether a philosopher is actually right about things becomes a secondary or derivative concern. The guiding purpose is to provoke more strictly philosophical discussion and study. As a result, the best philosophical idea directly equals the one producing the most subsequent philosophizing.

Brusseau attempts to locate decadence in the history of philosophy at [[Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche’s]] appropriation by recent French philosophers including [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].  He calls the moment a “reversal” in philosophy’s history, one where thought no longer exists to pursue truth, instead, truths exist to serve and accelerate thinking.&lt;ref&gt;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739109434&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from Brusseau’s published work and lectures whether he considers this development to be negative, neutral or positive.

== Philosophical ethics ==
Brusseau's ''Business Ethics Workshop''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flatworldknowledge.com//node/233286&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on philosophical approaches to the corporation’s role in society, and ethical questions arising around branding and the creation of product reputation. The fabrication of consumer needs and consumer identity is also considered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/Brusseau-Podcast&lt;/ref&gt;

Brusseau's ''Dignity, Pleasures, Vulgarity: Philosophy and Animal Rights''&lt;ref&gt;Heritage Radio, http://heritageradionetwork.org/podcast/dignity-pleasures-vulgarity-philosophy-and-animal-rights/&lt;/ref&gt; asks how animal studies reflect back to reveal human truths.&lt;ref&gt;KTEP/NPR, http://ktep.org/post/act-radio-james-brusseau&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Wealth Inequality Workshop''&lt;ref&gt;https://eportfolio.pace.edu/view/view.php?id=111964&lt;/ref&gt; unites [[utilitarianism]], [[Rawls]], [[Nozick]], [[Bataille]] and [[Deleuze]] to explore theoretical dilemmas of wealth inequality. Brusseau argues that the philosophies of Bataille and Deleuze can be mobilized both to allow and limit wealth inequality. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.economicrockstar.com/jamesbrusseau/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;

{{Sufism|Ideas}}
{{Alevism|Beliefs}}

'''Lataif-e-sitta''' ({{lang-fa|لطائف سته}}) or '''al-Laṭtaʾif as-Sitta''' ({{lang-ar|اللطائف الستة}}), meaning "'''The Six Subtleties'''", are psychospiritual "organs" or, sometimes, faculties of sensory and suprasensory perception in [[Sufi]] psychology, and are explained here according to the usage amongst certain Sufi groups. These six subtleties are thought to be parts of the self in a similar manner to the way glands and organs are part of the body.

Drawing from the [[Qur'an]], many Sufis distinguish [[Nafs]] (نفس), [[Qalb]] (قلب), Sirr (سیر), [[Ruh]] (روح), Khafi (خفی), and Akhfa (اخفٰی) as the six ''laṭaʾif''.

Among Sufis spiritual development involves awakening centers of perception that lie dormant in every person. The help of a guide is considered necessary to help activate them in a certain order. Each center is associated with a particular color, a general area of the body, and often with a particular prophet. Activation of all these "centers" is part of the inner methodology of the Sufi way or "Work".

Purification of the elementary passionate nature (''tazkiyat an-nafs''), cleansing the spiritual heart (''tazkiyat al-qalb''), becoming a receptacle of divine love (''ishq''), illumination of the spirit (''tajjali ar-ruh''), emptying egocentric drives (''taqliyyat as-sirr'') and remembering the divine attributes, often through repetition of the names of God, (''[[dhikr]]'') are a process by which the dervish is said to reach a certain type of "completion" in the opening of the last two faculties, ''khafi'' and ''akhfa''.

==Nafs==
{{main|Nafs}}
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2016}}

According to some, this latifa is located slightly below the navel, and is yellow, for others, it is between the eyebrows and is blue. 

The word nafs is usually translated as self or psyche. Its etymology is rooted in "breath" (similar to [[Biblical]] or [[Kabbalistic]] nefesh) and is common to virtually all archaic psychologies where the act of breathing was connected with life, animating otherwise lifeless object. Some Sufis consider under the term "Nafs" the entirety of psychological processes, encompassing whole mental, emotional and volitional life; however, the majority of Quranic-based Sufis are of the opinion that Nafs is a "lower", egotistical and passionate human nature which, along with Tab (literally, physical nature), comprises vegetative and animal aspects of human life. Ego may be assumed as an equivalent for Nafs in modern psychology. The central aim of the Sufi path is transformation of Nafs (technical term is ''tazkīyyat an-nafs'' or "purging of the soul") from its deplorable state of ego-centredness through various psycho-spiritual stages to the purity and submission to the will of God.

Although the majority of the Sufi orders have adopted convenient 7 maqāms (maqāms are permanent stages on the voyage towards spiritual transformation), and some still operate with 3 stages, the picture is clear: the Sufi's journey begins with ''an-nafs al-ʾammārah'' (commanding soul), ''an-nafs al-lawwāmah'' (self-accusing soul), and ends in ''an-nafs al-mutṭmaʾinnah'' (satisfied soul) - although some Sufi's final stage is, in their technical vocabulary, ''an-nafs aṣ-ṣāfīyah wa-al-kāmilah'' (soul restful and perfected). In essence, this is almost identical to Christian paradigm of the [[Imitation of God|via purgativa]] encompassing the various stages through which the spiritual aspirant passes in the journey toward God{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

==Qalb==
{{main|Qalb}}

According to some {{citation needed||date=December 2013}}, this latifa is located in the left of Chest, four fingers below the nipple and is golden yellow, for others it is red. In it man witnesses his deeds. By awakening it man also gets the knowledge of the realm of [[jinn]].

The word '''Qalb''', stands for heart. In Sufi terminology, this spiritual heart (not to be confused with the blood pumping organ) is again variously described. For some, it is the seat of beatific vision. Others consider it the gate of '''Ishq''' or Divine love. Yet, for the majority, it is the battleground of two warring armies: those of '''Nafs''' and '''Ruh''' or spirit. Here, one again encounters terminological confusion: for the Sufis influenced by [[Neoplatonism]], a "higher" part of Nafs is equated to the '''Aql''' or intellect (called Nafs-I-Natiqa) or "rational soul" and is the central active agent in spiritual battle: Ruh or spirit, notwithstanding its name, is rather passive in this stage. In short, cleansing of the Qalb or heart is a necessary spiritual discipline for travellers on the Sufi path. The term for this process is Tazkiah-I-Qalb and the aim is the erasure of everything that stands in the way of purifying God's love or '''Ishq'''. {{citation needed||date=December 2013}}

Often people take their heart's word (inner feeling) as truthful. If the hearts were indeed truthful, then why are not all the people of the heart united? Qalb of the common folk is in a sleeping or unconscious state, and does not possess any awareness or correct understanding. This heart can err in judgement due to the dominance of the Self and Khannas (the Whisperer), or due to the person's own simple-mindedness. Placing trust in a sleeping (or unconscious) heart is foolish. When the Name Allah does vibrate in the heart, an awareness of Right and Wrong and understanding follow. It is then called Qalb-e Salim (the sound Heart). Then the prominence of the meditation by Qalb changes its direction towards God; it is called Qalb-e Minib (the repentant Heart). This heart can prevent a person from mischief, but it can not make a right judgement. When the theophanies (Tajalliyat) of God begin to fall on the Heart, it is called Qalb-eshahid (the witnessing Heart).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Religion of God/The spiritual entity Qalb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruh==
{{main|Ruh}}

According to some, this latifa is located in the right side of the chest and is red, for others it is green. After its activation the human gets acquainted with '''Alam-e-Aaraf''' (the place where man resides after death).

This is on the right side of the chest. This is awakened and illuminated by the meditation and one-pointed concentration on it. Once it becomes illuminated, a vibration similar to the heartbeat is felt on the right side of the chest. Then the Name of God, Ya Allah is matched with the vibrating pulse. The meditation of the soul is done in this way. This is an advancement in rank and status and is better than the Qalb. It is able to travel to the realm of the souls (the station of the Archangel Gabriel). Anger and rage are attached to it that burn and turn into majesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Religion of God/The Human Soul]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruh or spirit is the second contender in the battle for human life. Again, opinions on Ruh differ among Sufis. Some deem it coeternal with God; others consider it a created entity. Be that as it may, Ruh is the plateau of consensus for the majority of Sufis, especially the early ones (before 11th/12th century C.E.). For those Sufis with Gnostic leanings (which can be found in [[Bektashi]] or [[Mevlevi]] orders), Ruh is a soul-spark, immortal entity and transegoic "true self", similar to the Christian concepts of "synteresis" or "Imago Dei", or Vedantist notion of "jiva", as well as Tibetan Buddhist "shes-pa", principle of consciousness and Taoist "shen" or spirit. But, the majority of the Sufis would consider this an unnecessarily extravagant speculation and would stick to the more orthodox notion of dormant spiritual faculty that needs to be worked upon by constant vigil and prayer in order to achieve the Tajliyya-I-Ruh, or Illumination of the spirit. Ironically, this spiritual faculty is frequently referred to in terms one encounters in connection with Nafs- "blind" life force or life current that needs to be purified by strict religious observances in order to achieve illumination.

==Sirr==

Sirr is located in the solar plexus and is associated with the color white. It records the orders of Allah for the individual in similitude to that which is originally present in '''Loh-e-mehfooz''' (Preserved Scripturum). After its activation, human being gets acquainted with '''Aalam-e-Misal''' (The Allegorical realm - Reflection of knowledge of the preserved Scripturum.) This center is associated with consciousness.

This is also awakened and illuminated by the meditation and one-pointed concentration on it with the Name of God, Ya Hayy, Ya Qayyum. The dream state or by spiritual separation from the physical body “transcendental meditation” it can journey to the realm of the secrets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Religion of God/The spiritual entity Sirri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirr, literally means "the secret". Emptying of the Sirr (Taqliyya-I-Sirr) is basically focusing on God's names and attributes in perpetual remembrance or Dhikr, hence diverting one's attention from the mundane aspects of human life and fixing it on the spiritual realm. The "emptying" signifies negation and obliteration of ego-centred human propensities.

==Khafi==

According to some, it is located in the middle of the forehead (between the eyes or third eye position) and is black, to others blue. It's the equivalent of Kitab-e-Marqoom (the written book).

According to others this is to the right of the centre of the chest. According to the Naqshbandi Saifi order, it is located to the top right of the chest, and is coloured black. It too is taught the Name of God Ya Wahid by meditation. It is green in colour and it can reach the realm of unification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Religion of God/The spiritual entity Khaffi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Khafi means mysterious, arcane or Latent Subtlety. It represents intuition.

==Akhfa==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2016}}

The term Akhfa or ikhfa means most arcane, deeply mysterious, or obscure, subtlety. Its location is deep inside the brain or on center-top of the head. The color of this center, according to some, is green, to others, violet. It's the '''Nuqta-e-wahida''' (point of unity) in every human where the '''Tajalliat''' (beatific visions) of Allah are directly revealed. It contains information about the hidden knowledge of the universe. By entering into this point, the human being enters the system of the universe and laws governing the universe. This center is associated with deep perception.

According to some this is situated at the centre of the chest. It is awakened by meditating on the Name of God, Ya Ahad. It is purple in colour and it too, is connected to that veil in the realm of unification behind which is the throne of God.

'''Matthew ("Matt") Cohen''' (30 December 1942 – 2 December 1999) was a Canadian writer who published both mainstream literature under his own name and children's literature under the pseudonym '''Teddy Jam'''.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

==History==

Matt Cohen was born in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], the son of Morris Cohen and Beatrice Sohn,&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkh2vJ_9GpEC&amp;pg=PA219 |title=Encyclopedia of literature in Canada |page=219 |ISBN=0-8020-0761-9 |year=2002 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |last=New |first=William H |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7utOftgVgJ4C&amp;pg=PA704 |page=704 |title=From Ink Lake: Canadian stories |last=Ondaatje |first=Michael |year=1995 |ISBN=0-394-28138-1 |publisher=Random House of Canada |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied political economy at the [[University of Toronto]] and taught political philosophy and religion at [[McMaster University]] in the late 1960s before publishing his first novel ''Korsoniloff'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

His fiction was translated into German, Dutch, French, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese.  ''The Spanish Doctor'', his biggest international success, continues to sell well in the French and Spanish markets.

His greatest critical success as a writer was his final novel ''[[Elizabeth and After]]'' which won the [[1999 Governor General's Awards|1999 Governor General's Award]] for English-language Fiction only a few weeks before his death.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He had been nominated twice previously, but had not won, in 1979 for ''The Sweet Second Summer of Kitty Malone'' and in 1997 for ''Last Seen''.

A founding member of the [[Writers' Union of Canada]],&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; he served on the executive board for many years and as president in 1986. During his presidency, the Writer's Union was finally able to persuade the government of Canada to form a commission and establish a [[Public Lending Right]] program.  He also served on the Toronto Arts Council as chair of the Literary Division and was able to obtain increased funding for writers. In recognition of this work, he was awarded a Toronto Arts Award and the Harbourfront Prize.

He also published a number of children's books under the pseudonym Teddy Jam. Cohen's authorship of the Teddy Jam books was not revealed until after his death.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; ''Dr. Kiss'', illustrated by Joanne Fitzgerald won the Governor General's Award in 1991 and ''Fishing Summer'' was also nominated for a Governor General's Award for children's literature in 1997, making Cohen one of the few writers ever to be nominated for Governor General's Awards in two different categories in the same year.

He was married three times; first to Arden Ford, next to Susan Bricker and then to Patsy Aldana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.mcmaster.ca/archives/findaids/fonds/c/cohen-m.htm |title=Matt Cohen fonds |publisher=McMaster University |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen died at home in Toronto after a battle with [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Matt Cohen (Obituary) |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/matt-cohen-obituary |last=Bemrose |first=John |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final book of short stories, ''Getting Lucky'', and his final Teddy Jam title, ''The Kid's Line'', were posthumously published in 2001. A Canadian literary award, the [[Matt Cohen Award]], is presented in Cohen's memory by the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]].&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writerstrust.com/Awards/Matt-Cohen-Award--In-Celebration-of-a-Writing-Life.aspx |title=Matt Cohen Award: In Celebration of a Writing Life |publisher=Writer's Trust of Canada |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film adaptation of his 1990 novel ''[[Emotional Arithmetic (film)|Emotional Arithmetic]]'' has been produced by Triptych films starring [[Max von Sydow]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Gabriel Byrne]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. It was the closing gala at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Rocchi |title=TIFF Review: ''Emotional Arithmetic'' |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/09/15/tiff-review-emotional-arithmetic/ |publisher=''Cinematical.com'' |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27277">[[Nature]] has two inter-related meanings in [[philosophy]]. On the one hand, it means the set of all things which are natural, or subject to the normal working of the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. On the other hand, it means the [[essence|essential properties]] and [[cause]]s of individual things.

How to understand the meaning and significance of nature has been a consistent theme of discussion within the history of [[Western Civilization]], in the [[philosophy|philosophical]] fields of [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], as well as in [[theology]] and [[science]]. The study of natural things and the regular laws which seem to govern them, as opposed to discussion about what it means to be natural, is the area of [[natural science]].

The word "nature" derives from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:natura#Latin|nātūra]]'', a philosophical term derived from the verb for [[birth]], which was used as a translation for the earlier ([[pre-Socratic]]) [[ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''[[Physis|phusis]]'', derived from the verb for natural growth.
Already in classical times, philosophical use of these words combined two related meanings which have in common that they refer to the way in which things happen by themselves, "naturally", without "interference" from human deliberation, divine intervention, or anything outside what is considered normal for the natural things being considered.

Understandings of nature depend on the subject and age of the work where they appear. For example, [[Aristotle]]'s explanation of natural properties differs from what is meant by natural properties in modern philosophical and scientific works, which can also differ from other scientific and conventional usage.

==Classical nature and Aristotelian metaphysics==
{{main|Physis}}
The [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] (from ''ta phusika'' "the natural [things]") is [[Aristotle]]'s principal work on nature. In [[Physics (Aristotle)#Book II|Physics II]].1, Aristotle defines a nature  as "a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192b21&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a nature is the principle within a natural raw material that is the source of tendencies to change or rest in a particular way unless stopped. For example, a rock would fall unless stopped. Natural things stand in contrast to artifacts, which are formed by human artifice, not because of an innate tendency. (The raw materials of a bed have no tendency to become a bed.) In terms of Aristotle's theory of [[four causes]], the word natural is applied both to the innate potential of matter cause and the forms which the matter tends to become naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 193b21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leo Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; the beginning of Western philosophy involved the "discovery or invention of nature" and the "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" was supplied by "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways'". In ancient Greek philosophy on the other hand, Nature or natures are ways that are "really universal" "in all times and places". What makes nature different is that it presupposes not only that not all customs and ways are equal, but also that one can "find one's bearings in the cosmos" "on the basis of inquiry" (not for example on the basis of traditions or religion). To put this "discovery or invention" into the traditional terminology, what is "by nature" is contrasted to what is "by convention". The concept of nature taken this far remains a strong tradition in modern western thinking. [[Science]], according to Strauss' commentary of Western history is the contemplation of nature, while [[technology]] was or is an attempt to imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss and Cropsey eds. History of Political Philosophy, Third edition, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Going further, the philosophical concept of nature or natures as a special type of causation -  for example that the way particular humans are is partly caused by something called "human nature" is an essential step towards [[Aristotle]]'s teaching concerning [[Causality|causation]], which became standard in all Western philosophy until the arrival of modern science.
[[File:Aristotle.jpg|right|thumb|Aristotle]]
Whether it was intended or not, Aristotle's inquiries into this subject were long felt to have resolved the discussion about nature in favor of one solution. In this account, there are four different types of cause:
* The [[material cause]] is the "raw material" - the matter which undergoes change. One of the causes of a statue being what it is might be that it is bronze. All meanings of the word nature encompass this simple meaning.
* The [[efficient cause]] is the motion of another thing, which makes a thing change, for example a chisel hitting a rock causes a chip to break off. This is the way which the matter is forming into a form so that it become substance like what Aristotle said that a substance must have a form and matter in order to call it substance. This is the motion of changing a single being into two. This is the most obvious way in which cause and effect works, as in the descriptions of modern science. But according to Aristotle, this does not yet explain that of which the motion is, and we must "apply ourselves to the question whether there is any other cause per se besides matter".&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics 995b, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Greek: μάλιστα δὲ ζητητέον καὶ πραγματευτέον πότερον ἔστι τι παρὰ τὴν ὕλην αἴτιον καθ᾽ αὑτὸ ἢ οὔ&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[formal cause]] is the form or idea which serves as a template towards which things develop - for example following an approach based upon Aristotle we could say that a child develops in a way partly determined by a thing called "human nature". Here, nature is a cause.
* The [[final cause]] is the aim towards which something is directed. For example, a human aims at something perceived to be good, as Aristotle says in the opening lines of the [[Nicomachean Ethics]].

The formal and final cause are an essential part of Aristotle's "[[Metaphysics]]" - his attempt to go beyond nature and explain nature itself. In practice they imply a human-like consciousness involved in the causation of all things, even things which are not man-made. Nature itself is attributed with having aims.&lt;ref&gt;As for example [[Aristotle Politics]] 1252b.1: "Thus the female and the slave are by nature distinct (for nature makes nothing as the cutlers make the Delphic knife, in a niggardly way, but one thing for one purpose; for so each tool will be turned out in the finest perfection, if it serves not many uses but one"&lt;/ref&gt;

The artificial, like the [[conventional]] therefore, is within this branch of Western thought, traditionally contrasted with the natural. [[Technology]] was contrasted with [[science]], as mentioned above. And another essential aspect to this understanding of causation was the distinction between the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]] properties of a thing and the [[Substance theory|substance]] - another distinction which has lost favor in the modern era, after having long been widely accepted in medieval Europe.

To describe it another way, Aristotle treated organisms and other natural wholes as existing at a higher level than mere matter in motion. Aristotle's argument for formal and final causes is related to a doctrine about how it is possible that people know things: "If nothing exists apart from individual things, nothing will be intelligible; everything will be sensible, and there will be no knowledge of anything—unless it be maintained that sense-perception is knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics 999b, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Greek: εἰ μὲν οὖν μηδέν ἐστι παρὰ τὰ καθ᾽ ἕκαστα, οὐθὲν ἂν εἴη νοητὸν ἀλλὰ πάντα αἰσθητὰ καὶ ἐπιστήμη οὐδενός, εἰ μή τις εἶναι λέγει τὴν αἴσθησιν ἐπιστήμην.&lt;/ref&gt; Those philosophers who disagree with this reasoning therefore also see [[knowledge]] differently from Aristotle.

Aristotle then, described nature or natures as follows, in a way quite different from modern science...

{{Quotation|"'''Nature'''" means:&lt;br&gt; '''(a)''' in one sense, the genesis of growing things — as would be suggested by pronouncing the υ of '''φύσις'''&lt;ref&gt;''Phusis'' is the Greek word for Nature, and Aristotle is drawing attention to the similarity it has to the verb used to describe natural growth in a plant, ''phusei''. Indeed the first use of the word involves a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. "So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature." Odyssey 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt; long—and&lt;br&gt; '''(b)''' in another, that immanent thing from which a growing thing first begins to grow.&lt;br&gt; '''(c)''' The source from which the primary motion in every natural object is induced in that object as such. All things are said to grow which gain increase through something else by contact and organic unity (or adhesion, as in the case of embryos). Organic unity differs from contact; for in the latter case there need be nothing except contact, but in both the things which form an organic unity there is some one and the same thing which produces, instead of mere contact, a unity which is organic, continuous and quantitative (but not qualitative). Again, "nature" means &lt;br&gt;'''(d)''' the primary stuff, shapeless and unchangeable from its own potency, of which any natural object consists or from which it is produced; e.g., bronze is called the "nature" of a statue and of bronze articles, and wood that of wooden ones, and similarly in all other cases. For each article consists of these "natures," the primary material persisting. It is in this sense that men call the elements of natural objects the "nature," some calling it fire, others earth or air or water, others something else similar, others some of these, and others all of them. Again in another sense "nature" means&lt;br&gt; '''(e)''' the substance of natural objects; as in the case of those who say that the "nature" is the primary composition of a thing, or as [[Empedocles]] says: ''Of nothing that exists is there nature, but only mixture and separation of what has been mixed''; nature is but a name given to these by men. Hence as regards those things which exist or are produced by nature, although that from which they naturally are produced or exist is already present, we say that they have not their nature yet unless they have their form and shape. That which comprises both of these exists by nature; e.g. animals and their parts. And '''nature is both the primary matter''' (and this in two senses: either primary in relation to the thing, or primary in general; e.g., in bronze articles the primary matter in relation to those articles is bronze, but in general it is perhaps water—that is if all things which can be melted are water) '''and the form or essence''', i.e. the end of the process, of generation. Indeed from this sense of "nature," by an extension of meaning, every essence in general is called "nature," because the nature of anything is a kind of essence. From what has been said, then, the primary and proper sense of "nature" is the essence of those things which contain in themselves as such a source of motion; for the matter is called "nature" because it is capable of receiving the nature, and the processes of generation and growth are called "nature" because they are motions derived from it. And nature in this sense is the source of motion in natural objects, which is somehow inherent in them, either potentially or actually.|Metaphysics 1014b-1015a, translated by Hugh Tredennick, emphasis added.&lt;ref&gt;Greek, with emphasis added as a guide: '''φύσις''' λέγεται ἕνα μὲν τρόπον ἡ τῶν '''φυομένων''' γένεσις, οἷον εἴ τις ἐπεκτείνας λέγοι τὸ υ, ἕνα δὲ ἐξ οὗ '''φύεται''' πρώτου τὸ '''φυόμενον''' ἐνυπάρχοντος: ἔτι ὅθεν ἡ κίνησις ἡ πρώτη ἐν ἑκάστῳ τῶν '''φύσει''' ὄντων ἐν αὐτῷ ᾗ αὐτὸ  [20]  ὑπάρχει: '''φύεσθαι''' δὲ λέγεται ὅσα αὔξησιν ἔχει δι᾽ ἑτέρου τῷ ἅπτεσθαι καὶ συμπεφυκέναι ἢ προσπεφυκέναι ὥσπερ τὰ ἔμβρυα: διαφέρει δὲ σύμφυσις ἁφῆς, ἔνθα μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲν παρὰ τὴν ἁφὴν ἕτερον ἀνάγκη εἶναι, ἐν δὲ τοῖς συμπεφυκόσιν ἔστι τι ἓν τὸ αὐτὸ ἐν ἀμφοῖν ὃ ποιεῖ ἀντὶ τοῦ  [25]  ἅπτεσθαι συμπεφυκέναι καὶ εἶναι ἓν κατὰ τὸ συνεχὲς καὶ ποσόν, ἀλλὰ μὴ κατὰ τὸ ποιόν. ἔτι δὲ φύσις λέγεται ἐξ οὗ πρώτου ἢ ἔστιν ἢ γίγνεταί τι τῶν φύσει ὄντων, ἀρρυθμίστου ὄντος καὶ ἀμεταβλήτου ἐκ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς αὑτοῦ, οἷον ἀνδριάντος καὶ τῶν σκευῶν τῶν χαλκῶν ὁ χαλκὸς ἡ  [30]  φύσις λέγεται, τῶν δὲ ξυλίνων ξύλον: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων: ἐκ τούτων γάρ ἐστιν ἕκαστον διασωζομένης τῆς πρώτης ὕλης: τοῦτον γὰρ τὸν τρόπον καὶ τῶν φύσει ὄντων τὰ στοιχεῖά φασιν εἶναι φύσιν, οἱ μὲν πῦρ οἱ δὲ γῆν οἱ δ᾽ ἀέρα οἱ δ᾽ ὕδωρ οἱ δ᾽ ἄλλο τι τοιοῦτον λέγοντες, οἱ δ᾽  [35]  ἔνια τούτων οἱ δὲ πάντα ταῦτα. ἔτι δ᾽ ἄλλον τρόπον λέγεται ἡ φύσις ἡ τῶν φύσει ὄντων οὐσία, οἷον οἱ λέγοντες τὴν φύσιν εἶναι τὴν πρώτην σύνθεσιν, ἢ ὥσπερ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς λέγει ὅτι "φύσις οὐδενὸς ἔστιν ἐόντων, ἀλλὰ μόνον μῖξίς τε διάλλαξίς τε μιγέντων ἔστι, φύσις δ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῖς ὀνομάζεται ἀνθρώποισιν. "Empedocles Fr. 8 διὸ καὶ ὅσα φύσει ἔστιν ἢ γίγνεται, ἤδη ὑπάρχοντος ἐξ οὗ πέφυκε γίγνεσθαι ἢ εἶναι, οὔπω φαμὲν [5] τὴν φύσιν ἔχειν ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ τὸ εἶδος καὶ τὴν μορφήν. φύσει μὲν οὖν τὸ ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων τούτων ἐστίν, οἷον τὰ ζῷα καὶ τὰ μόρια αὐτῶν: '''φύσις δὲ ἥ τε πρώτη ὕλη''' (καὶ αὕτη διχῶς, ἢ ἡ πρὸς αὐτὸ πρώτη ἢ ἡ ὅλως πρώτη, οἷον τῶν χαλκῶν ἔργων πρὸς αὐτὰ μὲν πρῶτος ὁ χαλκός, ὅλως δ᾽ [10] ἴσως ὕδωρ, εἰ πάντα τὰ τηκτὰ ὕδωρ) '''καὶ τὸ εἶδος καὶ ἡ οὐσία''': τοῦτο δ᾽ ἐστὶ τὸ τέλος τῆς γενέσεως. μεταφορᾷ δ᾽ ἤδη καὶ ὅλως πᾶσα οὐσία φύσις λέγεται διὰ ταύτην, ὅτι καὶ ἡ φύσις οὐσία τίς ἐστιν. ἐκ δὴ τῶν εἰρημένων ἡ πρώτη φύσις καὶ κυρίως λεγομένη ἐστὶν ἡ οὐσία ἡ τῶν ἐχόντων [15] ἀρχὴν κινήσεως ἐν αὑτοῖς ᾗ αὐτά: ἡ γὰρ ὕλη τῷ ταύτης δεκτικὴ εἶναι λέγεται φύσις, καὶ αἱ γενέσεις καὶ τὸ φύεσθαι τῷ ἀπὸ ταύτης εἶναι κινήσεις. καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς κινήσεως τῶν φύσει ὄντων αὕτη ἐστίν, ἐνυπάρχουσά πως ἢ δυνάμει ἢ ἐντελεχείᾳ.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been argued, as will be explained below, that this type of theory represented an oversimplifying diversion from the debates within Classical philosophy, possibly even that Aristotle saw it as a simplification or summary of the debates himself. But in any case the theory of the four causes became a standard part of any advanced education in the [[Middle Ages]].

==Modern science and laws of nature: trying to avoid metaphysics==
[[File:Democritus by Agostino Carracci.jpg|thumb|right|A Renaissance imagined representation of Democritus, the laughing philosopher, by [[Agostino Carracci]]]]

In contrast, Modern Science took its distinctive turn with [[Francis Bacon]], who rejected the four distinct causes, and saw Aristotle as someone who "did proceed in such a spirit of difference and contradiction towards all antiquity: undertaking not only to frame new words of science at pleasure, but to confound and extinguish all ancient wisdom". He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as [[Democritus]] "who did not suppose a [[mind]] or [[reason]] in the frame of things", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein "the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/90/mode/2up/search/democritus II.VII.7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531191702/http://www.archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft |date=2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And so Bacon advised...

{{Quotation|Physic doth make inquiry, and take consideration of the same natures : but how? Only as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms. For example; if the cause of whiteness in snow or froth be inquired, and it be rendered thus, that the subtile intermixture of air and water is the cause, it is well rendered ; but, nevertheless, is this the form of whiteness? No; but it is the efficient, which is ever but ''vehiculum formæ''. This part of metaphysique I do not find laboured and performed...|Francis Bacon, ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/88/mode/2up/search/whiteness II.VII.6]}}

[[File:Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Bacon]]
In his ''[[Novum Organum]]'' Bacon argued that the only forms or natures we should hypothesize are the "simple" (as opposed to compound) ones such as the ways in which [[heat]], [[Motion (physics)|movement]], etc. work. For example, in aphorism 51 he writes:

{{Quotation|51. The human understanding is, by its own nature, prone to abstraction, and supposes that which is fluctuating to be fixed. But it is better to dissect than abstract nature; such was the method employed by the school of Democritus, which made greater progress in penetrating nature than the rest. It is best to consider matter, its conformation, and the changes of that conformation, its own action, and the law of this action or motion, for forms are a mere fiction of the human mind, unless you will call the laws of action by that name.}}

Following Bacon's advice, the scientific search for the formal cause of things is now replaced by the search for "[[natural law|laws of nature]]" or "[[law of physics|laws of physics]]" in all scientific thinking. To use Aristotle's well-known terminology these are descriptions of [[efficient cause]], and not [[formal cause]] or [[final cause]]. It means modern science limits its hypothesizing about non-physical things to the assumption that there are regularities to the ways of all things which do not change.

These general laws, in other words, replace thinking about ''specific'' "laws", for example "''human'' nature". In modern science, human nature is part of the same general scheme of cause and effect, obeying the same general laws, as all other things. The above-mentioned difference between accidental and substantial properties, and indeed knowledge and opinion, also disappear within this new approach that aimed to avoid metaphysics.

As Bacon knew, the term "laws of nature" was one taken from medieval [[Aristotelianism]]. St Thomas of Aquinas for example, defined law so that nature really was legislated to consciously achieve aims, like human law: "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community and promulgated".&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologiae I-II Q90, A4&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, roughly contemporary with Bacon, Hugo [[Grotius]] described the law of nature as "a rule that [can] be deduced from fixed principles by a sure process of reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Law of War and Peace]]'', Proleg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; And later still, Montesquieu was even further from the original legal metaphor, describing laws vaguely as "the necessary relations deriving from the nature of things".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Spirit of the Laws]], opening lines&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Hobbes]]
One of the most important implementors of Bacon's proposal was [[Thomas Hobbes]], whose remarks concerning nature are particularly well-known. His most famous work, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', opens with the word "Nature" and then parenthetically defines it as "the art whereby [[God]] hath made and governes the world". Despite this pious description, he follows a Baconian approach. Following his contemporary, [[Descartes]], Hobbes describes life itself as mechanical, caused in the same way as [[clockwork]]:

{{Quotation | For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life?}}

On this basis, already being established in [[natural science]] in his lifetime, Hobbes sought to discuss politics and human life in terms of "laws of nature". But in the new modern approach of Bacon and Hobbes, and before them [[Machiavelli]] (who however never clothed his criticism of the Aristotelian approach in medieval terms like "laws of nature"),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Prince]] 15:- "...since my intent is to write something useful to whoever understands it, it has appeared to me more fitting to go directly to the effectual truth of the thing than to the imagination of it. And many have imagined republics and principalities that have never been seen or known to exist in truth; for it is so far from how one lives to how one should live that he who lets go of what is done for what should be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation. For a man who wants to make a profession of good in all regards must come to ruin among so many who are not good. Hence it is necessary to a prince, if he wants to maintain himself, to learn to be able not to be good, and to use this and not use it according to necessity."&lt;/ref&gt; such laws of nature are quite different to human laws: they no longer imply any sense of better or worse, but simply how things really are, and, when in reference to laws of ''human'' nature, what sorts of human behavior can be most relied upon.

=="Late modern" nature==
[[File:Rousseau.jpg|right|thumb|Jean-Jacques Rousseau: a civilized man, but a person who questioned whether civilization was according to human nature.]]
Having disconnected the term "law of nature" from the original medieval metaphor of human-made law, the term "law of nature" is now used less than in early modern times.

To take the critical example of human nature, as discussed in ethics and politics, once early modern philosophers such as Hobbes had described human nature as whatever you could expect from a mechanism called a human, the point of speaking of human nature became problematic in some contexts.

In the late 18th century, [[Rousseau]] took a critical step in his [[Second Discourse]], reasoning that [[human nature]] as we know it, [[Rationality|rational]], and with [[language]], and so on, is a result of historical accidents, and the specific up-bringing of an individual. The consequences of this line of reasoning were to be enormous. It was all about the question of nature. In effect it was being claimed that human nature, one of the most important types of nature in Aristotelian thinking, did not exist as it had been understood to exist.

==The survival of metaphysics==

The approach of modern science, like the approach of Aristotelianism, is apparently not universally accepted by all people who accept the concept of nature as a reality which we can pursue with reason.

Bacon and other opponents of Metaphysics claim that all attempts to go beyond nature are bound to fall into the same errors, but Metaphysicians themselves see differences between different approaches.

[[Immanuel Kant]] for example, expressed the need for a Metaphysics in quite similar terms to Aristotle.

{{Quotation|...though we cannot know these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in a position at least to think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything that appears.|''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' pp. Bxxvi-xxvii}}

As in Aristotelianism then, Kantianism claims that the human mind must itself have characteristics which are beyond nature, metaphysical, in some way. Specifically, Kant argued that the human mind comes ready-made with ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' programming, so to speak, which allows it to make sense of nature.

==The study of nature without metaphysics==

Authors from [[Nietzsche]] to [[Richard Rorty]] have claimed that science, the study of nature, can and should exist without metaphysics. But this claim has always been controversial. Authors like Bacon and Hume never denied that their use of the word "nature" implied metaphysics, but tried to follow Machiavelli's approach of talking about what works, instead of claiming to understand what seems impossible to understand.

==Heartland Institute incident==

On February 20, 2012, Gleick announced he was responsible for the unauthorized distribution of [[The Heartland Institute#February 2012 document misappropriation|documents]] from [[The Heartland Institute]] in mid-February. Gleick reported he had received "an anonymous document in the mail describing what appeared to be details of the Heartland Institute's climate program strategy", and in trying to verify the authenticity of the document, had "solicited and received additional materials directly from the Heartland Institute under someone else's name".&lt;ref name="gleick120220"&gt;Gleick, P.H., [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/-the-origin-of-the-heartl_b_1289669.html "The Origin of the Heartland Documents"], 2012-02-20, [[Huffington Post]].&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the leak, The Heartland Institute said one of the documents released, a two-page 'Strategy Memo', had been forged.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.02.15"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillis|first=Justin|last2=Kaufman|first2=Leslie|title=Leak Offers Glimpse of Campaign Against Climate Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/science/earth/in-heartland-institute-leak-a-plan-to-discredit-climate-teaching.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gleick denied forging the document. Gleick described his actions as "a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics" and said that he "deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case" and "offer[ed his] personal apologies to all those affected". He stated that "My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts – often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated – to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved."&lt;ref name=gleick120220/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/science/earth/activist-says-heartland-climate-papers-obtained-by-deceit.html "Activist Says He Lied to Obtain Climate Papers"], ''New York Times'', published February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a "temporary short-term leave of absence" from the Institute.&lt;ref name='PIleave'&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldenberg | first = Suzanne | title = Peter Gleick on leave from Pacific Institute over Heartland leak | date = 2012-02-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/25/peter-gleick-leave-pacific-institute-heartland-leak | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20040326 "Peter Gleick requests short-term leave of absence from Oakland's Pacific Institute"], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Feb 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors stated it was "deeply concerned regarding recent events" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/statement.html Pacific Institute Board of Directors statement], Feb 27, 2012.

'''''Philosophical Fragments''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] title: {{lang|da|Philosophiske Smuler eller En Smule Philosophi}}) is a Christian philosophical work written by [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in 1844. It was the second of three works written under the [[pseudonym]] ''Johannes Climacus''; the other two were ''[[De omnibus dubitandum est]]'' in 1841 and ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'' in 1846.

==Overview==
Kierkegaardian scholars D. Anthony Storm{{#tag:ref|Storm says Johannes Climacus (Kierkegaard) is not a Christian but is explaining how one would become a Christian if one was interested in becoming that. See his commentary on Kierkegaard's unpublished book ''Johannes Climacus'' 1841-42 http://sorenkierkegaard.org/johannes-climacus.html|group="nb"}} and [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] believe Kierkegaard could be referring to [[Johannes Climacus]], a 7th-century [[Christian monk]], who believed that an individual is converted to Christianity by way of a ladder, one rung (virtue) at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short Life of Kierkegaard'', by Walter Lowrie, 1942, 1970, Princeton University p. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard believes the individual comes to an understanding with Christ by a leap.

Kierkegaard scholar and translator [[David F. Swenson (translator)|David F. Swenson]] was the first to translate the book into English in 1936. He called it "Philosophical Chips" in an earlier biography of Kierkegaard published in 1921{{#tag:ref|Refer to ''Søren Kierkegaard'', Scandinavian studies and notes, Volume 6 No. 7 August 1921 Editor George T Flom University of Illinois Published in Menasha, Wisconsin p. 24 https://archive.org/stream/scandinavianstu06sociuoft#page/24/mode/1up|group="nb"}}and another early translator, [[Lee Milton Hollander]], called it "Philosophic Trifles" in his early translation of portions of Kierkegaard's works in 1923.{{#tag:ref|Hollander provides more insight ''Selections from the writings of Kierkegaard'' 1923, Hollander, Lee Milton, 1880–1972 https://archive.org/stream/selectionsfromwr00kieruoft#page/26/mode/2up|group="nb"}}

Kierkegaard hinted that he might write a "sequel in 17 pieces" in his preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'' p. 5 http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&amp;C=2378&lt;/ref&gt;  By February 22, 1846 he published a 600-page sequel to his 83-page ''Fragments''. He devoted over 200 pages of ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' to an explanation of what he meant by ''Philosophical Fragments''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' Chapter IV p 361ff&lt;/ref&gt;

He referred to a quote by [[Plato]] in his ''Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'':  "But I must ask you Socrates, what do you suppose is the upshot of all this? As I said a little while ago, it is the scrapings and shavings of argument, cut up into little bits." – ''[[Greater Hippias]]'', 304a. He could have been thinking about this quote when he wrote this book. Plato was asking "What is beauty?" Kierkegaard asks, "What is Truth?"&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Postscript'' title page&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard had already asked about truth 9 days earlier when he published [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|''Three Upbuilding Discourses'']]. A mere 4 days from the publication of ''Philosophical Fragments'' he published ''The Concept of Anxiety''.

Kierkegaard wrote his books in reaction to both [[Philosophy of history|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] as well as the philosophic-historical use of speculation in regard to Christianity. Schlegel published a book bearing the same title as Kierkegaard's, ''Philosophical Fragments'' in 1799.{{#tag:ref|Schlegel's book was bits of philosophy cut up into little fragments https://books.google.com/books?id=M49TbSqbzyAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=friedrich+von+schlegel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A9nuTe_qC66r0AGDta3yDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Friedrich Schlegel's Lucinde and the Fragments, By Friedrich von Schlegelb University of Minnesota Press, 1971 He also wrote The Philosophy of History, this link takes you to Lecture X - ''On the Christian Point of View in the Philosophy of History'' https://archive.org/stream/philosophyofhist00schlrich#page/274|group="nb"}}

==Structure==
Kierkegaard always wrote a [[preface]] signed by the name of the pseudonymous author he was using. He began this practice with his unpublished book ''Johannes Climacus'' and continued it throughout his writing career. However, he added his own name as the person responsible for publication of ''Philosophical Fragments'', ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', ''The Sickness Unto Death'' and ''Practice in Christianity''. He also wrote many [[discourse]]s which he signed with his own name. He began that practice with the writing of ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843|Two Upbuilding Discourses]]'' in 1843. 
He divides his book into five major sections 
*A Project of Thought
*The God as Teacher and Savior: An Essay of the Imagination
*The Absolute Paradox of the Offended Christian
**Appendix: The Paradox and the Offended Consciousness
*The Case of the Contemporary Disciple
**Interlude
*The Disciple at Second Hand

Later, in his ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' Kierkegaard said "The Issue in ''Fragments'' is an Introductory Issue, Not to Christianity but to Becoming a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992 p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kierkegaard uses familiar Christian vocabulary to develop his own method for arriving at Truth. He presents two views, the Socratic and the religious. [[Socrates]] is considered an authoritative voice in the philosophic community so Kierkegaard begins with his ideas. He developed the [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|doctrine of recollection]] which Kierkegaard makes use of in his explanation of Truth and [[I know that I know nothing|ignorance]].

His aim is to advance beyond Socrates, who was interested in finite truth, to another Teacher who explained Eternal Truth. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] movement was intent on combining concepts of God, nature, knowledge and man into one world view. Kierkegaard was a [[counter-Enlightenment]] writer.&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard within your grasp'', by Shelley O'Hara, Wiley Publishing inc. p. 10 https://books.google.com/books?id=kC6UFe633GAC&amp;dq=Kierkegaard%20within%20your%20grasp&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that knowledge of God was a "condition" that only "the God" can give and the "Moment" God gives the condition to the Learner has "decisive significance".&lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Fragments, Swenson p. 11-14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vatsoc.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Socrates]] remained true to himself, through his manner of life giving artistic expression to what he had [[understood]]. ''Philosophical Fragments'' p, 8]]
He uses the [[Category (Kant)|category]] of the single individual to help those seeking to become Christians. He says, "I am he who himself has been educated to the point of becoming a Christian. In the fact that education is pressed upon me, and in the measure that it is pressed, I press in turn upon [[Danish Golden Age|this age]]; but I am not a teacher, only a fellow student."&lt;ref&gt;''Point of View'', Lowrie p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; And again, "Once and for all I must earnestly beg the kind reader always to bear ''in mente'' (in mind) that the thought behind the whole work is: what it means to become a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;''Point of View'', Lowrie, note p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He can only bring an individual to the point of becoming a Christian because the single individual must choose to become a Christian in freedom. Kierkegaard says, either believe or be offended. But choose.

[[Philosophy of Religion|Philosopher]]s and [[Historicity of Jesus|Historian]]s tend to try to prove Christianity rather than teach belief in Christ through faith. Kierkegaard says,{{Quotation|"As long as I keep my hold on the proof, i.e., continue to demonstrate, the existence does not come out, if for no other reason than that I am engaged in proving it; but when I let the proof go, the existence is there." (...) "unless we hold fast to the Socratic doctrine of Recollection, and to his principle that every individual man is [[Man]], [[Sextus Empiricus]] stands ready to make the transition involved in "teaching" not only difficult but impossible; and [[Protagoras]] will begin where Sextus Empiricus leaves off, maintaining that man is the measure of all things, in the sense that the individual man is the measure for others, but by no means in the Socratic sense that each man is his own measure, neither more nor less. ''Philosophical Fragments'' p. 29-30, 32 (See ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 367-368)

Analogy: whoever believes that there is a God and also a providence has an easier time (in preserving the faith), an easier time in definitely gaining the faith (and not an illusion) in an imperfect world, where passion is kept vigilant, than in an absolutely perfect world. In such a world, faith is indeed inconceivable. If all the angels united, they would still be able to produce only an approximation, because in historical knowledge an approximation is the only certainty-but also too little on which to build an eternal happiness. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong translation p. 29-30}}

===A Project of Thought===
Kierkegaard uses the Doctrine of Recollection as an example of how truth was found in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] and is still found in [[Psychotherapy#Systems|psychotherapy]] and [[Medical history|modern medicine]]. Both of these sciences are based on questioning the patient, "Learner", in the  hope of jogging their memory about past events. The therapist could ask the right question and not realize he has received the answer he was looking for, this is known as [[Meno#Meno's paradox|Meno's paradox]]. Kierkegaard puts his paradox this way, "what a man knows he cannot seek, since he knows it; and what he does not know he cannot seek, since he does not even know for what to seek."&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem for the "Learner" is that he is in "Error",  and is ignorant of his Error. He had the truth from birth, he knew who his creator was, but forgot. Kierkegaard calls this Error "Sin". How can he find out that he had vested his life in outer  goods rather than the [[Fruit of the Spirit|inner goods of the Spirit]]? A Teacher must bring him the "condition"{{#tag:ref|Kierkegaard started talking about the condition in Either/Or &lt;blockquote&gt;Every human being, no matter how slightly gifted he is, however subordinate his position in life may be,  has a natural need to formulate a life-view, a conception of the meaning of life and of its purpose. The person who lives esthetically also does that, and the popular expression heard in all ages and from various stages is this: One must enjoy life. There are, of course, many variations of this, depending on differences in the conceptions of enjoyment, but all are agreed that we are to enjoy life. But the person who says that he wants to enjoy life always posits a condition that either lies outside the individual or is within the individual in such a way that it is not there by virtue of the individual himself. I beg you to keep rather fixed the phrases of this last sentence, for they have been carefully chosen. ''Either/Or II'' p. 180ff see also ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 98-100 and ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' p. 27, 132-139&lt;/blockquote&gt;|group="note"}} necessary for understanding the Truth.{{#tag:ref|He forgot about [[Job (biblical figure)|Job's]] lessons. "His soul belonged to the world as its illegitimate possession; it belonged to God as his legitimate possession; it belonged to Kierkegaard as his possession, as a possession that is to be gained."&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]|group="nb"}} He explains the whole process this way: &lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quotation|In so far as the learner is in Error, but in consequence of his own act (and in no other way can he possibly be in this state, as we have shown above), he might seem to be free; for to be what one is by one's own act is freedom. And yet he is in reality unfree and bound and exiled; for to be free from the Truth is to be exiled from the Truth, and to be exiled by one's own self is to be bound. But since he is bound by himself, may he not loose his bonds and set himself free? For whatever binds me, the same should be able to set me free when it wills; and since this power is here his own self, he should be able to liberate himself. But first at any rate he must will it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quotation|for he forges the chains of his [[Moses|bondage]] with the strength of his [[Free will|freedom]], since he exists in it without compulsion; and thus his bonds grow strong, and all his powers unite to make him the [[slave]] of [[sin]]. -- What now shall we call such a [[Paraclete|Teacher]], one who restores the lost condition and gives the learner the Truth? Let us call him [[Christ|''Saviour'']], for he saves the learner from his bondage and from himself; let us call him ''[[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]]'', for he redeems the learner from the captivity into which he had plunged himself, and no captivity is so terrible and so impossible to break, as that in which the individual keeps himself. And still we have not said all that is necessary; for by his self-imposed bondage the learner has brought upon himself a burden of guilt, and when the Teacher gives him the condition and the Truth he constitutes himself an ''[[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]]'', taking away the wrath impending upon that of which the learner has made himself [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]y. Such a [[Holy Spirit|Teacher]] the learner will never be able to forget. For the moment he forgets him he sinks back again into himself, just as one who while in original possession of the condition forgot that God exists, and thereby sank into bondage. ''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 12-13&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}
[[File:Schiavone 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The conversion of [[Saint Paul]] by [[Andrea Meldolla]] 1510-1553]]

Now he owes everything to his Teacher but is saddened that it took so long to find out that he forgot his soul belonged to God and not to the world, and he "Repents".&lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Fragments p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The "Moment"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard wrote about the finite moment in Either/Or I, Swenson An ecstatic lecture p. 37-38 and Part II, Hong p. 21-22, 83-85 now he's writing about the Eternal Moment. http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&amp;C=2380&lt;/ref&gt; the Teacher brings the condition the learner experiences a "[[Born again (Christianity)|New Birth]]". Kierkegaard says a "change has taken place within him like the change from [[Nothing|non-being]] to [[being]]. He calls this change "Conversion".&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "When one who has experienced birth thinks of himself as born, he conceives this transition from non-being to being. The same principle must also hold in the case of the new birth. Or is the difficulty increased by the fact that the non-being which precedes the new birth contains more being than the non-being which preceded the [[human birth|first birth]]? But who then may be expected to think the new birth?"&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; This is a paradox.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the seed of the oak is planted in earthen vessels, they break asunder; when new wine is poured in old leather bottles, they burst; what must happen when the God implants himself in human weakness, unless man becomes a new vessel and a new creature! But this becoming, what labors will attend the change, how convulsed with birth-pangs! And the understanding—how precarious, and how close each moment to misunderstanding, when the anguish of guilt seeks to disturb the peace of love! And how rapt in fear; for it is indeed less terrible to fall to the ground when the mountains tremble at the voice of the God, than to sit at table with him as an equal; and yet it is the God's concern precisely to have it so. ''Philosophical Fragments'' p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many an individual has not asked, “What is truth?” and at bottom hoped that it would be a long time before the truth would come so close to him that in the same instant it would determine what it was his duty to do at that moment. When the Pharisee, “in order to justify himself,” asked, “Who is my neighbor?” he presumably thought that this might develop into a very protracted inquiry, so that it would perhaps take a very long time and then perhaps end with the admission that it was impossible to define the concept “[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neighbour neighbor]” with absolute accuracy – for this very reason he asked the question, to find an escape, to waste time, and to justify himself. But God catches the wise in their foolishness, and Christ imprisoned the questioner in the answer that contained the task. So it is with all Christ’s answers. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' p. 96-97&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The truth is within me, that is, when I am truly within myself (not untruthfully outside myself), the truth, if it is there, is a being, a life. Therefore it says, "This is eternal life, to know the only true God and the one whom he sent, the truth." (John 14:6 The Bible) That is, only then do I in truth know the truth, when it becomes a life in me. Therefore Christ compares truth to food and appropriating it to eating, just as, physically, food by being appropriated (assimilated) becomes the life sustenance, so also, spiritually, truth is both the giver of life and the sustenance of life, is life. ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong 1991 p. 206&lt;/blockquote&gt; But Kierkegaard went deeply into the choice in his first book, Either/Or: {{Quotation|Let me make a little psychological observation. We frequently hear people vent their dissatisfaction in a complaint about life; often enough we hear them wishing. Imagine a poor wretch like that; let us skip over the wishes that shed no light here because they involve the utterly accidental. He wishes: Would that I had that man's intellect, or that man's talent etc. Indeed, to go to the extreme: Would that I had that man's steadfastness. Wishes of that sort are frequently heard, but have you ever heard a person earnestly wish that he could be someone else? It is so far from being the case that it is particularly characteristic of people called unfortunate individualities that they cling most of all to themselves, that despite all their sufferings they still would not wish to be anybody else for all the world. That is because such people are very close to the truth, and they feel the eternal validity of the personality not in its blessing but in its torment, even if they have retained this totally abstract expression for the joy in it; that they prefer to go on being themselves. But the person with many wishes is nevertheless continually of the opinion that he would be himself even if everything were changed. Consequently, there is something within him that in relation to everything else is absolute, something whereby he is who he is even if the change he achieved by his wish were the greatest possible. That he is mistaken, I shall show later, but at this point I merely want to find the most abstract expression for this "self" that makes him who he is. And this is nothing other than freedom. By this route it is actually possible to present a very plausible demonstration of the eternal validity of the personality. Indeed, even a suicide does not actually will to do away with his self; he, too, wishes-he wishes another form of his self, and this is why we certainly find a suicide who is very convinced of the immortality of the soul, but whose whole being was so ensnared that he believed he would by this step find the absolute form for his spirit. The reason, however, it may seem to an individual as if he could be changed continually and yet remain the same, as if his innermost being were an algebraic symbol that could signify anything whatever it is assumed to be, is that he is in a wrong position, that he has not chosen himself, does not have a concept of it, and yet there is in his folly an acknowledgment of the eternal validity of his personality. But for him who is in a proper position things take another course. He chooses himself-not in a finite sense, for then this "[[self]]" would indeed be something finite that would fall among all the other finite things-but in the absolute sense, and yet he does choose himself and not someone else. This self that he chooses in this way is infinitely concrete, for it is he himself, and yet it is absolutely different from his former self, for he has chosen it absolutely. This self has not existed before, because it came into existence through a choice, and yet it has existed, for it was indeed "himself." The choice here makes two dialectical movements simultaneous-that which is chosen does not exist and comes into existence through the choice-and that which is chosen exists; otherwise it was not a choice. In other words, if what I chose did not exist but came into existence absolutely through the choice, then I did not choose-then I created. But I do not create myself-I choose myself. Therefore, whereas nature is created from nothing, whereas I myself as immediate personality am created from nothing, I as free spirit am born out of the principle of contradiction and am born through choosing myself.

===The God as Teacher, Saviour and the Paradox===
Kierkegaard leads his reader to consider how a teacher might become a teacher. He says life and its circumstances constitute an occasion for an individual to become a teacher and he in turn becomes an occasion for the learner to learn something. Socrates was such a teacher as this. But what about God? What would be the occasion that moved him to become a Teacher? God is moved by love but his love is unhappy. He wants to make himself understood just like a teacher but He's teaching something that doesn't come to an individual from the known world but from a world that is Unknown. "His love is a love of the learner, and his aim is to win him. For it is only in love that the unequal can be made equal, and it is only in equality or unity that an understanding can be effected, and without a perfect understanding the Teacher is not the God, unless the obstacle comes wholly from the side of the learner, in his refusing to realize that which had been made possible for him."&lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Fragments p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

God's goal is to make himself understood and, according to Kierkegaard, he has three options. He could elevate the learner to help the learner forget the misunderstanding. God could show himself to the learner and cause him to forget his Error while contemplating God's presence. Both options are rejected on the basis of [[Identity (philosophy)|equality]]. How can God make himself equal to man? Only by [[Potentiality and actuality|becoming]] man himself, but not a king, or a leader of an established order, no, for equality's sake he must become one of the humblest, a servant.&lt;ref&gt;Read it here from his book: [http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&amp;C=2380 Philosophical Fragments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works of Love'', 1847 Hong 1995 p. 87ff&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kierkegaard-to-find-the-idea.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Kierkegaard's Journal 1835]]
But God can't make himself understood because he's completely unlike every other human being. God has not sinned, whereas every human being has. This is a paradox but the ultimate paradox is that a single individual who looks just like everyone else is God. "The thesis that God has existed in human form, was born, grew up; is certainly the paradox in the strictest sense, the absolute paradox." Christianity is also a paradox as well as the forgiveness of sins.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' p. 217 (read p.202-217) also see ''Philosophical Fragments'' p.31-35 and ''The Sickness Unto Death'' p. 132-133 Hannay&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard is saying that the "Moment" the individual comes in contact with the Paradox is of utmost importance because this is where the decision is made. This is his [[Either/Or]]. Either believe or be offended.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard wrote about this in ''Either/Or'' p. 213-219 as well as his discourses but states it most clearly in ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993, p.203-212|&lt;/ref&gt; Reason is attempting to understand the Paradox but comes to its own limit and can't understand what it knows nothing about. {{Quotation|how should the Reason be able to understand what is absolutely different from itself? If this is not immediately evident, it will become clearer in the light of the consequences; for if the God is absolutely unlike man, then man is absolutely unlike the God; but how could the Reason be expected to understand this? Here we seem to be confronted with a paradox. Merely to obtain the knowledge that the God is unlike him, man needs the help of the God; and now he learns that the God is absolutely different from himself. But if the God and man are absolutely different, this cannot be accounted for on the basis of what man derives from the God, for in so far they are akin. Their unlikeness must therefore be explained by what man derives from himself, or by what he has brought upon his own head. ''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 34 (see 31-34)}}

Kierkegaard says [[Reason]] "collides" with the knowledge of the [[Noumenon|Unknown]]. If Reason and God have a happy encounter the individual comes to be a believer. If the collision results in an unhappy encounter the Reason is Offended. The Reason says that the Paradox is [[Absurdism|absurd]] and can get no meaning from the encounter. But when "Reason yielded itself while the Paradox bestowed itself, and the understanding is consummated in that happy passion, the individual is happy and asks for nothing more."&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 35-38, Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 349-352, Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 199-222&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Dr. Stephen Hicks, Professor of Philosophy at Rockford College created a YouTube video explaining Kierkegaard's view about faith and reason https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdby3iip69k|group="nb"}} Kierkegaard says Christ offers every single individual the "invitation."{{#tag:ref|Kierkegaard explained this further in his book ''Training in Christianity'', which is now translated ''[[s:Selections from the writings of Kierkegaard/Preparation for a Christian Life|Practice in Christianity]]''.|group="nb"}}

===The Disciple and the Disciple at Second Hand===
Kierkegaard explores how a contemporary of Christ and succeeding generations receive the "condition" necessary to understand  the Paradox that God has permitted himself to be born and wrapped in swaddling-clothes. A contemporary could have been living abroad and in that case the contemporary would have to hear the story from eyewitnesses. How reliable would they be? The only thing they saw was a lowly servant.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophic Fragments'' p. 42-46&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate contemporary can "serve as an occasion for the acquirement of [[historical]] knowledge", an occasion to help the individual [[understanding|understand]] himself in the Socratic sense, or the contemporary could have received the condition from God and become a believer.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophic Fragments'' p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The "condition" comes into [[existence]]. Kierkegaard says the "coming-into-existence is a kind of change, but is not a change in [[essence]] but in [[Ontology|being]] and is a transition from not existing to existing. But this non-being which the subject of coming into existence leaves behind must itself have some sort of being. He asks his reader to consider whether the [[Logical possibility|necessary]] can come into existence or if the necessary "Is", since everything that comes into existence is [[Historicism|historical]]. But for Kierkegaard "all coming into existence takes place in [[free will|freedom]]." The [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] freely [[Liberty|chooses]] to follow Christ when the Holy Spirit convinces him that he's a sinner.

He finally discloses what this "condition" the "Moment" brings to the individual. He says, "faith{{#tag:ref|"''Tro'' is translated here and in the following three pages as belief or "faith"--- Josiah Thompson says the following about Kierkegaard's use of the word Tro, &lt;blockquote&gt;In Fragments Climacus makes clear that he means to give the Danish term for belief, Tro, a double sense. "In the most eminent sense" it will refer to the Christian's faith, his capacity to believe against reason and the awful paradox of God's entry into time through Christ. As the mental act that somehow holds together oppositions of incalculable severity, Tro, in this sense is "the category of despair." But there is another "direct and ordinary sense" of Tro that refers not to the relationship of mind to the Christian paradox, but to "the relationship of the mind to the historical." In this second sense of belief, Tro is "the category of doubt." In both senses Tro is founded on opposition, ultimately on the opposition which is consciousness itself. Also in both senses, Tro is seen as a mental act that respects yet defeats the opposition which upon which it is founded. "Defeat" may be too strong a word, for uncertainty is never really defeated by Tro, but only ignored, uncoupled, put out of circuit. Thus Climacus argues that "in the certainty of belief there is always a negated uncertainty, in every way corresponding to the becoming of existence. Belief believes what it does not see; it sees that the star is there, but what it believes is that the star has come into existence." &lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Fragments P. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The essential claim, then, is that the existence of anything cannot be known, but must be believed. ''Kierkegaard'', by Josiah Thompson, Alfred A. Knopf, 1973, p. 173 (See p. 170-180))&lt;/blockquote&gt; see also [[Martin Buber#Philosophy|Martin Buber]] [[I and Thou]] for his explanation of the same concept|group="nb"}} has precisely the required character; for in the [[certainty]] of belief there is always present a [[negation|negated]] [[uncertainty]], in every way corresponding to the uncertainty of coming into existence. [[Sola fide|Faith]] believes what it does not see..." &lt;ref&gt;''Philosophic Fragments'' p. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Through the objective uncertainty and ignorance the paradox thrusts away in the inwardness of the existing person. But since the paradox is not in itself the paradox, it does not thrust away intensely enough. For without risk, no faith; the more risk, the more faith. The more objective reliability, the less inwardness (since inwardness is subjectivity). The less objective reliability, the deeper is the possible inwardness. When the paradox itself is the paradox, it thrusts away by virtue of the absurd, and the corresponding passion of inwardness is faith. When Socrates believed that God is, he held fast the objective uncertainty with the entire passion of inwardness, and faith is precisely in this contradiction, in this risk. Now it is otherwise. Instead of the objective uncertainty, there is here the certainty that, viewed objectively, it is the absurd, and this absurdity, held fast in the passion of inwardness, is faith. What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up, has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being.

An individual can know what Christianity is without being a Christian. Kierkegaard says, "By [[Baptism]] [[Christianity]] gives him a name, and he is a Christian ''de nomine'' (by name); but in the [[Decision making|decision]]{{#tag:ref|Kierkegaard devoted his first book Either/Or to making a decision and choosing either God or the world. He wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;If a man esthetically ponders a host of life tasks, then he … does not readily have one Either/Or but a great multiplicity, because the self-determining aspect of the choice has not been ethically stressed and because, if one does not choose absolutely, one chooses only for the moment and for that reason can choose something else the next moment. What is important in choosing is not so much to choose the right thing as the energy, the earnestness, and the pathos with which one chooses. In the choosing the personality declares itself in its inner infinity and in turn the personality is thereby consolidated. ''Either/Or II'' Part II p. 167&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;His self is, so to speak, outside him, and it has to be acquired, and repentance is his love for it, because he chooses it absolutely from the hand of God. What I have expressed here is not academic wisdom; it is something every person can express if he wants to, something every person can will if he so wills. This, you see, is why it is so hard for individuals to choose themselves, because the absolute isolation here is identical with the most profound continuity, because as long as one has not chosen oneself there seems to be a possibility of one way or another of becoming something different. So here you have my humble view of what it is to choose and to repent. It is improper to love a young girl as if she were one's mother or one's mother as if she were a young girl; every love has its distinctiveness; love of God has its absolute distinctiveness, and its expression is repentance. (…) The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose ''eo ipso'' the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice. I as free spirit am born out of the principle of contradiction and am born through choosing myself.

But surely it is different when an individual, who is qualified as spirit, relates himself to a generation. Or is it assumed that Christian parents give birth to Christian children as a matter of course? At least Christianity does not assume it; on the contrary, it assumes that sinful children are born of Christian parents just as in paganism. Or will anyone assume that by being born of Christian parents one has come a single step closer to Christianity than the person born of pagan parents if, please note, he also is brought up in Christianity? And yet it is of this confusion that modern speculative thought is, if not directly the cause, nevertheless often enough the occasion so that the individual is regarded as related to the development of the human spirit as a matter of course (just as the animal specimen is related to the species), as if development of spirit were something one generation can dispose of by a will in favor of another, as if the generation and not individuals were qualified as spirit, which is both a self-contradiction and an ethical abomination. Development of spirit is self-activity; the spiritually developed individual takes his spiritual development along with him in death.

Belief is not a form of knowledge, but a free act, an expression of [[Will (philosophy)|will]], it is not having a relationship with a [[doctrine]] but having a relationship with God.

Kierkegaard mentioned [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (1730-1788) in his book ''Repetition'' p.&amp;nbsp;149 (1843) and this book, ''Philosophical Fragments'' (p.&amp;nbsp;38ff, Swenson), and what Kierkegaard writes is written also by Hamann in his book, ''Socratic Memorabilia'', in this way: {{Quotation|[[File:Johann Georg Hamann (1730 –1788).jpg|thumb|left|130px|Johann Hamann]]The opinion of Socrates can be summarized in these blunt words, when he said to the Sophists, the learned men of his time, “I know nothing.” Therefore these words were a thorn in their eyes and a scourge on their backs. All of Socrates’ ideas, which were nothing more than expectorations and secretions of his ignorance, seemed as frightful to them as the hair of Medusa’s head, the knob of the Aegis. The ignorance of Socrates was sensibility. But between sensibility and a theoretical proposition is a greater difference than between a living animal and its anatomical skeleton. The ancient and modern sceptics may wrap themselves ever so much in the lion skin of Socratic ignorance; nevertheless they betray themselves by their voices and ears. If they know nothing, why does the world need a learned demonstration of it? Their hypocrisy is ridiculous and insolent. Whoever needs so much acumen and eloquence to convince himself of his ignorance, however, must cherish in his heart a powerful repugnance for the truth of it. Our own existence and the existence of all things outside us must be believed, and cannot be determined in any other way. What is more certain than the end of man, and of what truth is there a more general and better attested knowledge? Nevertheless, no one is wise enough to believe it except the one who, as Moses makes clear, is taught by God himself to number his days. What one believes does not, therefore, have to be proved, and a proposition can be ever so incontrovertibly proven without on that account being believed. There are proofs of truth which are of as little value as the application which can be made of the truths themselves; indeed, one can believe the proof of the proposition without giving approval to the proposition itself. The reasons of a Hume may be ever so cogent, and the refutations of them only assumptions and doubts; thus faith gains and loses equally with the cleverest pettifogger and most honorable attorney. Faith is not the work of reason, because faith arises just as little from reason as tasting and seeing does.

{{Quotation|if it is the misfortune of the age that it has come to know too much, has forgotten what it means to exist and what inwardness is, then it was important that sin not be conceived in abstract categories, in which it cannot be conceived at all, that is, decisively, because it stands in an essential relation to existing. Therefore it was good that the work was a psychological inquiry, which in itself makes clear that sin cannot find a place in the system, presumably just like immortality, faith, the paradox, and other such concepts that essentially related to existing, just what systematic thinking ignores. The expression "anxiety" does not lead one to think of paragraph pomposity but rather of existence inwardness. Just as "[[Fear and Trembling|fear and trembling]]" is the state of the [[teleology|teleologically]] suspended person when God tempts him, so also is anxiety the teleologically suspended person's state of mind in that desperate exemption from fulfilling the ethical.

==Reviews and assessments==
Kierkegaard was criticized by his former teacher and pastor [[Hans Lassen Martensen]], he concludes from Kierkegaard's writing, here and in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', that he's saying an individual can be saved without the help of the Church. Martensen believed 19th century [[Socialism]] would destroy [[individual]]ity, but regarded Kierkegaard's emphasis on the single individual as too one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/christianethicsg00mart#page/202/mode/2up Read Section 63-71&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard was responding to Hegelian writers such as [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[David Strauss]] who emphasized the objective nature of God. God is just man's idea. {{Quotation|Man is an object to God, before God perceptibly imparts himself to man; he thinks of man; he determines his action in accordance with the nature of man and his needs. God is indeed free in will; he can reveal himself or not; but he is not free as to the understanding; he cannot reveal to man whatever he will, but only what is adapted to man, what is commensurate with his nature such as it actually is; he reveals what he must reveal, if his revelation is to be a revelation for man, and not for some other kind of being. Now what God thinks in relation to man is determined by the idea of man – it has arisen out of reflection on human nature. God puts himself in the place of man, and thinks of himself as this other being can and should think of him; he thinks of himself, not with his own thinking power, but with man's. In the scheme of his revelation God must have reference not to himself, but to man's power of comprehension. That which comes from God to man, comes to man only from man in God, that is, only from the ideal nature of man to the phenomenal man, from the species to the individual. Thus, between the [[Revelation|divine revelation]] and the so-called human reason or nature, there is no other than an illusory distinction; – the contents of the divine revelation are of human origin, for they have proceeded not from God as God, but from God as determined by human reason, human wants, that is, directly from human reason and human wants. And so in revelation man goes out of himself, in order, by a circuitous path, to return to himself! Here we have a striking confirmation of the position that the secret of theology is nothing else than anthropology – the knowledge of God nothing else than a knowledge of man!

An early existentialist, [[Miguel de Unamuno]], discussed the relation between faith and reason in relation to Kierkegaard's "Postscript" to this book.
{{Quotation|just as there is logical truth, opposed to error, and moral truth, opposed to falsehood, so there is also aesthetic truth or verisimilitude, which is opposed to extravagance, and religious truth or hope, which is opposed to the inquietude of absolute despair. For esthetic verisimilitude, the expression of which is sensible, differs from logical truth, the demonstration of which is rational; and religious truth, the truth of faith, the substance of things hoped for, is not equivalent to moral truth, but superimposes itself upon it. He who affirms a faith built upon a basis of uncertainty does not and cannot lie. And not only do we not believe with reason, nor yet above reason nor below reason, but we believe against reason. Religious faith, it must be repeated yet again, is not only irrational, it is contra-rational. Kierkegaard says: "Poetry is illusion before knowledge; religion illusion after knowledge. Between poetry and religion the worldly wisdom of living plays its comedy. Every individual who does not live either poetically or religiously is a fool" (''Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrif''t, chap, iv., sect. 2a, 2, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments''). The same writer tells us that Christianity is a desperate [[sortie]] (salida). Even so, but it is only by the very desperateness of this sortie that we can win through to hope, to that hope whose vitalizing illusion is of more force than all rational knowledge, and which assures us that there is always something that cannot be reduced to reason. And of reason the same may be said as was said of Christ: that he who is not with it is against it. That which is not rational is contra-[[Rationality|rational]]; and such is hope. By this circuitous route we always arrive at hope in the end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thetragicsenseof00unamuoft ''THE TRAGIC SENSE OF LIFE IN MEN AND IN PEOPLES'' (1921) Unamuno, Miguel de, 1864-1936 p. 198 ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hegel and his followers accepted Christianity without miracles or any other [[supernaturalism]]. Robert Solomon puts it this way: &lt;blockquote&gt;"What is Christianity, "revealed religion," divested of its "figurative thought"? It is a faith without icons, images, stories, and myths, without miracles, without a resurrection, without a nativity, without [[Chartres Cathedral|Chartres]] and [[Fra Angelico]], without wine and wafers, without heaven and hell, without God as judge and without judgment. With philosophical conceptualization, the Trinity is reduced to [[Immanuel Kant#Categories of the Faculty of Understanding|Kant]]'s categories of Universality (God the father) Particularity (Christ the Son) and Individuality (The Holy Spirit). The incarnation no longer refers to Christ alone, but only to the philosophical thesis that there is no God other than humanity. Spirit, that is, humanity made absolute, is God, which is to say that there is nothing other than humanity … What is left after the philosophical conceptualization of religion? To the orthodox Christian, nothing is left, save some terminology which has been emptied of its traditional significance. From Hegel's gutted Christianity to [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s aesthetic atheism is a very short distance indeed. ''From Hegel to Existentialism'', By [[Robert C. Solomon]], Oxford University Press US, 1989 p. 61&lt;ref&gt;(See pages 59-68) as well as Chapter 5 Kierkegaard and Subjective Truth p. 72ff https://books.google.com/books?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=faith+and+knowledge+hegel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jZ3ATfuYAY_rgQfIlcDUBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eduard Geismar gave a seminar about the religious thought of Kierkegaard in 1933. He said, "Kierkegaard develops the concept of an existential thinker. The task of such a thinker is to understand himself in his existence, with its uncertainty, its risk and its [[pathos|passion]]. Socrates was such an existential thinker. … from Socrates he has learned his method of communication, the indirect method. From Socrates he has learned to abstain from giving the reader and objective result to memorize, a [[Systematic Theology|systematic]] scheme for arrangement in paragraphs, all of which is relevant only to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[science]], but irrelevant to existential thought. From Socrates he has learned to confront the reader with a question, to picture the ideal as a [[possibility (disambiguation)|possibility]]. From Socrates he has learned to keep the reader at a distance, to throw him back on his individual responsibility, to compel him to find his own way to a solution. Kierkegaard does not merely talk about self-reliance; his entire literary art is devoted to the promotion of self-reliance."&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on the Religious Thought of Søren Kierkegaard'', by Eduard Geismar, Given at Princeton Theological Seminary in March 1936 p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] vehemently disagreed with Kierkegaard's subjective ideas. He was [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and had no room in his system for faith. Kierkegaard seemed to rely on faith at the expense of the [[Sacrifice of the intellect|intellect]]. He developed the idea of [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. His idea is relative to Kierkegaard's idea of the Moment. If a [[Situation (Sartre)|situation]] (occasion for Kierkegaard) makes an individual aware of his authentic self and the individual fails to choose that self that constitutes bad faith.

Sartre was against Kierkegaard's view that God can only be approached subjectively. 
{{Quotation|Compared with Hegel, Kierkegaard scarcely seems to count. He is certainly not a philosopher; moreover, he himself refused this title. In fact, he is a Christian who is not willing to let himself be enclosed in the system and who, against Hegel's "[[intellectualism]]," asserts unrelentingly the irreducibility and the specificity of what is lived. There is no doubt, as [[Jean Wahl]] has remarked, that a Hegelian would have assimilated this romantic and obstinate consciousness to the "unhappy consciousness," a moment which had already been surpassed and known in its essential characteristics. But it is precisely this objective knowledge which Kierkegaard challenges. For him the surpassing of the unhappy consciousness remains purely verbal. The existing man cannot be assimilated by a system of ideas. Whatever one may say or think about suffering, it escapes knowledge to the extent that it is suffered in itself, for itself, and to the degree that knowledge remains powerless to transform it. "The philosopher constructs a palace of ideas and lives in a hovel." Of course, it is religion which Kierkegaard wants to defend. Hegel was not willing for Christianity to be "surpassed," but for this very reason he made it the highest moment of human existence. Kierkegaard, on the contrary, insists on the transcendence of the Divine; between man and God he puts an infinite distance. The existence of the Omnipotent cannot be the object of an objective knowledge; it becomes the aim of a subjective faith. And this faith, in turn, with its strength and its spontaneous affirmation, will never be reduced to a moment which can be surpassed and classified, to a knowing. Thus Kierkegaard is led to champion the cause of pure, unique subjectivity against the objective universality of essence, the narrow, passionate intransigence of the immediate life against the tranquil mediation of all reality, faith, which stubbornly asserts itself, against scientific evidence – despite the scandal.

[[Marxism]] &amp; Existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre 1960&lt;ref&gt;See the link to this article in Primary sources below&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Time Magazine]] summed up Sartre and [[Albert Camus|Camus]]' interpretation of Kierkegaard in this way, {{Quotation|Modern "existentialists," like Sartre and Camus, have kidnapped Kierkegaard's "absurdity," stripped it of all religious significance, and beaten it into insensibility, using it merely as a dummy to dramatize what they consider the futility of any way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, Religion: Great Dane December 16, 1946 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934769-1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christian point of view===
[[Johann Goethe]] was influenced by Jean Jacques Rousseau's book, ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' and Kierkegaard may have been also. Here is a quotation from his book: {{Quotation|Whether matter is eternal or created, whether its origin is passive or not, it is still certain that the whole is one, and that it proclaims a single intelligence; for I see nothing that is not part of the same ordered system, nothing which does not co-operate to the same end, namely, the conservation of all within the established order. This being who wills and can perform his will, this being active through his own power, this being, whoever he may be, who moves the universe and orders all things, is what I call God. To this name I add the ideas of intelligence, power, will, which I have brought together, and that of kindness which is their necessary consequence; but for all this I know no more of the being to which I ascribe them. He hides himself alike from my senses and my understanding; the more I think of him, the more perplexed I am; I know full well that he exists, and that he exists of himself alone; I know that my existence depends on his, and that everything I know depends upon him also. I see God everywhere in his works; I feel him within myself; I behold him all around me; but if I try to ponder him himself, if I try to find out where he is, what he is, what is his substance, he escapes me and my troubled spirit finds nothing. Convinced of my unfitness, I shall never argue about the nature of God unless I am driven to it by the feeling of his relations with myself. Such reasonings are always rash; a wise man should venture on them with trembling, he should be certain that he can never sound their abysses; for the most insolent attitude towards God is not to abstain from thinking of him, but to think evil of him.
 From ''The Creed of the Savoyard Priest'' 1762}}

Soren Kierkegaard read the works of both Hegel and Goethe. His ideas expressed in this book could have come from a few maxims written by Johann Goethe. Goethe and Kierkegaard each stressed the need for the individual to come to an understanding of what the Bible is all about and then applying that understanding as it is appropriated.{{Quotation|Literature is a fragment of fragments: the least of what happened and was spoken, has been written; and of the things that have been written, very few have been preserved. And yet, with all the fragmentary nature of literature, we find thousand fold repetition; which shows how limited is man's mind and destiny.

We really learn only from those books which we cannot criticize. The author of a book which we could criticize would have to learn from us. That is the reason why the Bible will never lose its power; because, as long as the world lasts, no one can stand up and say: I grasp it as a whole and understand all the parts of it. But we say humbly: as a whole it is worthy of respect, and in all its parts it is applicable. There is and will be much discussion as to the use and harm of circulating the Bible. One thing is clear to me: mischief will result, as heretofore, by using it phantastically as a system of dogma; benefit, as heretofore, by a loving acceptance of its teachings. I am convinced that the Bible will always be more beautiful the more it is understood; the more, that is, we see and observe that every word which we take in a general sense and apply specially to ourselves, had, under certain circumstances of time and place, a peculiar, special, and directly individual reference. ''Goethe Maxims on Literature and Art'' Maxims, 404-405, 456-459 &lt;ref&gt;from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33670 Maxims and Reflections]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Paul Tillich]] and [[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-orthodox]] theologians were influenced by Søren Kierkegaard. Tillich's book ''The New Being''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showbook.asp?title=375 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126182030/http://www.religion-online.org/showbook.asp?title=375 |archivedate=2005-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to Kierkegaard's idea of the "New Birth". He's more of a [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] than an [[Existentialist]]. Many of the 20th century [[Theologian]]s attempt to answer all the questions of Christianity for the individual, like [[Quest for the historical Jesus|who Jesus was]] as a [[person]]. Kierkegaard's idea was different. He believed each single individual comes to Christ in his or her unique way.&lt;ref&gt;Here is a YouTube recording of [[C. S. Lewis]] writing about the New Man in the 1940s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvcx6ATLYiI&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt; He was against all speculation regarding whether or not an individual accepts the prompting of the Holy Spirit. A New Birth doesn't come about through historical or philosophical ponderings. He wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is a prayer which especially in our times would be so apt: 'God in heaven, I thank you for not requiring a person to comprehend Christianity, for if it were required, then I would be of all men the most miserable. The more I seek to comprehend it, the more I discover merely the possibility of offence. Therefore, I thank you for requiring only faith and I pray you will continue to increase it." "When love forgives the [[Theological virtues|miracle]] of faith happens"&lt;ref&gt;Sickness Unto Death, 1989 Hannay p.165, 162 (note), Works of Love, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Emil Brunner]] mentioned Kierkegaard in his 1934 book ''Mediator''. "This is the stumbling-block in Christianity: that revelation, the divine manifestation-that is, eternal truth and everlasting salvation-has to be connected with the fact which took place once for all, or,-it amounts to the same thing-that we can never approach God directly but only through the Mediator. This stumbling-block is not only through the intellect-as Kierkegaard’s teaching would suggest. It is true, of course, that to the Greeks the message of the Cross was foolishness. Pride of intellect revolts against the claim that truth lies outside the realm of reason."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/mediatorstudyofc00brun Mediator: a study of the central doctrine of the Christian faith] by Emil Brunner 1934, 1947 P. 42, 130, 185-186, 332, 430 &lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Thomas Merton]], a [[Trappist Monk]] was influenced by ''Philosophical Fragments'' and other works by Kierkegaard.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Run to the mountain: the story of a vocation'', By Thomas Merton in secondary links below&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a book about the new birth in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Read [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIAzq6xvnbgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+new+man+merton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4BiDToznH6XG0AGkyrWjAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=62&amp;f=false ''The New Man'']&lt;/ref&gt; Merton says we come to an understanding with God because he gives us free speech, [[Parrhesia]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Man, By Thomas Merton p. 62ff&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard and Merton both point more to understanding than to reason as the motivating factor in belief.

University of Pennsylvania Professor [[Louis H. Mackey]] described Johann Climacus' point of view in his 1971 book ''Kierkegaard: A Kind  of Poet'' (p.&amp;nbsp;164): "Climacus’ point in the Philosophical Fragments is that Christianity, which came into the world as a Miracle, ever remains a mystery beyond comprehension and imagination, intelligible only to a faith that is itself miraculous and God-given. But this does not mean that the act of faith entails spiritual suicide; it is rather the refusal to believe that stultifies. In any encounter of man with God-and that is what Christianity proposes-the initiative is God’s. Man’s only possible responses are faith or offense."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Mackey, Kierkegaard: A Kind of Poet 1971 University of Pennsylvania Press p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie Watkin, from the [[University of Tasmania]], Australia, wrote the following about this book: Philosophical Fragments (…) "investigates in somewhat abstract philosophical language the Platonic-Socratic idea of recollection of truth before considering how truth is brought about in Christianity. The distinction made here is that with the former, the individual possesses the truth and so the teacher merely has to provoke it maieutically to the surface, so to speak, and is not vitally important, since any teacher would do. Where Christianity is concerned, the individual is like a blind person, needing the restoration of sight before he or she can see. The individual had the condition for seeing initially but is to blame for the loss of sight. The individual in Christianity thus needs the God and Savior to provide the condition for learning the truth that the individual is in untruth (i.e., sin). Since the God appears in the form of a lowly human and is not immediately recognizable, there is the element of the paradox. The individual must set aside objections of the understanding so that the paradoxical savior (who is the vitally important object of faith rather than the teaching) can give him-or herself to the individual in the moment along with the condition of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Kierkegaard's Philosophy,'' By Julie Watkin, Scarecrow Press, 2001 p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Was Kierkegaard a [[Monergism|Monergist]] or a [[Synergism (theology)|Synergist]]?  God's love moves everything.&lt;blockquote&gt;Moved by love, the God is thus eternally resolved to reveal himself. But as love is the motive so love must also be the end; for it would be a contradiction for the God to have a motive and an end which did not correspond. His love is a love of the learner, and his aim is to win him. For it is only in love that the unequal can be made equal, and it is only in equality or unity that an understanding can be effected, and without a perfect understanding the Teacher is not the God, unless the obstacle comes wholly from the side of the learner, in his refusing to realize that which had been made possible for him. But this love is through and through unhappy, for how great is the difference between them! It may seem a small matter for the God to make himself understood, but this is not so easy of accomplishment if he is to refrain from annihilating the unlikeness that exists between them. ''Philosophical Fragments'' p. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">'''Rasmus Storm's Notebook''' is a handwritten collection of tunes written in the 1760s by Rasmus Storm. It is one of the earliest and most important collections of [[Danish traditional music]]. Storm was a Danish [[fiddler]] and dancing master (teacher) born in 1733 on the Island of [[Funen]]. He was the son of an indentured peasant and worked as an assistant to a merchant. He began compiling his tunebook around 1760, but it is unknown where he learned the tunes. Among the tunes are [[minuet]]s, [[Polska (dance)|polskas]], [[bourrée]]s, [[March (music)|marches]] and [[rigadoon]]s - as well as otherwise unknown dance types such as "dantz" and "serras" and several folk melodies.

Since starting as a [[Secret Santa]] exchange, RedditGifts has added a variety of different themed exchanges that run throughout the year, such as [[Nintendo]] and [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name="AboutRG" /&gt; The service also runs Arbitrary Day, "a celebration of nothing in particular". Up to 2011, approximately $1.5 million had been spent by Reddit users on the project.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==History==
RedditGifts was originally created by Reddit user Dan McComas,&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ries|first1=Brian|title=Secret Santa: The Creator of Reddit's Gift Exchange, the World's Biggest|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-santa-the-creator-of-reddits-gift-exchange-the-worlds-biggest|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "kickme444" as known on the site, and "5days". McComas first conceived the idea while working on freelance projects in 2009.&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG" /&gt;

The site was launched in 2009 with 4,500 participants;&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; the website reports that 212,894 people worldwide participated in the event during 2014.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt;

The site is a three-time [[Guinness World Record]] holder for the World's Largest Gift Exchange.&lt;ref name="WorldRecordRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=redditgifts Secret Santa Guinness World Record|url=https://www.redditgifts.com/blog/view/worldrecord/|website=RedditGifts|publisher=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldRecordGWR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest online Secret Santa game|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-online-secret-santa-game|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reddit acquisition===
In August 2011, Reddit bought the RedditGifts site. The two site-runners reportedly could not afford to continue maintaining the site while simultaneously working their day jobs. Both site-runners continued to run the website, although they are not involved with the daily operations of Reddit.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; The company takes a 15 to 20 percent cut of every purchase. Reddit operates the website as part of its ongoing plans to monetise their website. As of December 2013, approximately 14 percent of Reddit's revenue came from running the service, although McComas said that those sales alone could "put Reddit firmly in the black", and that the company may choose to reinvest funds in [[e-commerce]] customer service and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

In December 2013, while expressing his desire for the Reddit business to become self-sustaining, then-Chief Executive [[Yishan Wong]] stated that the RedditGifts service "provides real value", and called it "promising" for the business. Wong increased the staff count dedicated to the project to eight after realising the service's potential.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

{{Jainism}}

'''Shrimad Rajchandra''' (11 November 1867 – 9 April 1901) was a [[Jainism|Jain]] poet, mystic, philosopher, scholar and reformer. Born near [[Morbi]], he was a prodigy and claimed to have recollection of his past lives at the age of seven. He performed ''Avadhāna'', a memory retention and recollection test that gained him popularity, but he later discouraged it in favour of his spiritual pursuits. He wrote a large number of philosophical poetry including ''[[Atma Siddhi]]''. He also wrote a large number of letters and commentaries and translated some religious texts. He is best known for his teachings on Jainism and his spiritual guidance to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. 

==Early life==

Shrimad Rajchandra was born on 11 November 1867 (Kartik Sud Purnima, [[Vikram Samvat]] 1924), in Vavania, a port near [[Morbi]] (now in [[Gujarat]], India). His mother, Devbai, was [[Svetambara]] [[Sthanakvasi]] [[Jain]] and his father, Ravjibhai Mehta and paternal grand father, Panchan Mehta, were [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]]. So he was introduced to Jainism and Hinduism from early life.&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=126}} They were from [[Baniya|Vaniya]] community and from Dasa [[Shrimali]] caste.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=125}} He was initiated in Vaishnavism by a [[Sadhu]] named Ramadasji.&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=126—127}} He continued to study other [[Indian religions]] and was attracted to [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) doctrine of Jainism. Later he chose Jainism because he considered that it provides best path to salvation.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=127}} But Vaishnavism left a lasting influence on him.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=127}}

His birth name was Lakshminandan Mehta. He was renamed Raichand by his parents when he was four years old. Later his name changed to its [[Sanskrit]] form, Rajchandra. Shrimad, an honorific, was added by his disciples posthumously. His disciples also refer to him as Param Krupalu Dev (Lord of the Highest Compassion).&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=126}}

===Recollection of previous lives===

Rajchandra claimed that he first attained ''jāti smaraṇa gnān'' (recollection of previous lives) at the age of seven, in 1874. In an 1890 reply to a question from Padamshibhai, his friend in Bombay, he described the incident:{{snf|Salter|2002|p=131}}&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raj1964"/&gt;{{quote|"When I was seven years old, an elderly man named Amichand, well-built, stout and sturdy, a neighbor in my village, suddenly died of a snake bite. I did not know what was death. I asked my grandfather as to what was the meaning of death. He tried to evade the reply and advised me to finish my meals. I insisted on a reply. At last he said: "To die means the separation of the soul from the body. A dead body has no movement, it contaminates and decays. Such a dead body will be burnt to ashes near a river-bank as it has ceased to function." Then I went secretly to the cremation ground and climbing a Babul tree I saw the whole process of cremation of the dead man's body and I felt that those who burnt him were cruel. A train of thoughts started on the nature of the death and as a result I could recollect my previous lives.}}

This incident played a pivotal role in his perception of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajchandra|first1=Shrimad|title=Shrimad Rajchandra|journal=Haathnondh-1|issue=6th edition|page=801|url=https://archive.org/details/shrimadvachanamrutweb|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his spiritual journey in one of his poem. He wrote that he advanced on the path of spirituality he had already attained in his previous life. He claimed that he developed complete resignation and detachment to his mortal body and the rest of the world in 1897. He thanked the day of the experience in one of his poem written at the age of 30.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt; The tree he climbed no longer exist but a monument temple with a model of the event was erected on the site.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=131}}

He experienced the same when he visited the fort in [[Junagadh]]. His experiences influenced him to live a religious life.&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"/&gt;

===Prodigy===

Rajchandra had an exceptional memory retentiveness and recollection. He joined the school at the age of seven and half but mastered the preliminaries in calculation in just a month. In two years, he completed the study of seven grades.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"/&gt;

At the age of eight, he started composing poems. He composed verse synopses on ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' at the age of nine.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=128}} He gained maturity in thinking and reasoning and by the age of 10 started public speaking. At the age of 11 He started writing articles in newspapers and magazines, such as in ''[[Buddhiprakash]]'' and won several prizes in essay writing competitions. He wrote a 300-stanza poem on 'a watch' at the age of 12. In 1880, he went to [[Rajkot]] to study English, but very little is known about his education there. By 1882, he had studied and mastered several subjects. He became popular as a young poet and was referred to as Kavi due to it. He occasionally visited the residence of the ruler of [[Cutch State|Kutch]] as a writer where is handwriting were praised as best. He started attending his father's shop at age of 13. He composed many poems on life of [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] while sitting in the shop.{{efn-ua|as written by Shrimad in his ''Samucchaya Vayacharya''.}}&lt;ref name="CSCSU"&gt;{{cite web | website=Computer Science Department, Colorado State University. | url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/rajchandra.html |title=Life of Shrimad Rajchandra|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"&gt;{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html | accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

===''Avadhāna''===

[[Avadhanam|''Avadhāna'']] is a difficult test of attention and recollection in which a person attends multiple objects and activities at a time. In 1884, Rajchandra came from Vavania to Morbi where he saw Shastri Shankarlal M. Bhatt performing eight ''Avadhāna'' at a time. Gattulalji Maharaj was performing the same in [[Bombay]]. He saw the performance and quickly picked it up. Just two days after the performance, he performed it in front of his friends and later in public. Initially he performed 12 ''Avadhāna'' in public in [[Morbi]] but later he performed 16 ''Avadhāna'' in audience of two thousand in [[Wadhwan]], which was praised in newspapers. He performed 52 ''Avadhāna'' in [[Botad]] in a private meeting with his friend Harilal Shivalal Sheth which included playing ''[[Chopat]]'' game with three players; playing cards with three players; playing chess; keeping count of the sound of a small gong; mentally computing arithmetic sums involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (4); keeping count of the movement of beads along a thread; solving eight new problems; composing verses on eight diverse topics selected at the time and in the specific [[metre (poetry)|metre]] chosen by various members of the audience (16); rearranging 400 words of various languages spoken in random order including Greek, English, Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, Latin, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Maru, Jadeji, in the right order of subject, predicate (16); teaching a student; contemplating various figures of speech (2); all at one time.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=132}}

He performed ''śatāvadhāna'' (100 ''Avadhāna'') at Sir Framji Cowasji Institute in Bombay on 22 January 1887, which gained him praise and publicity. He was awarded gold medals by institutes and public for his performances as well as title of ‘Sakshat [[Saraswati]]’ (Incarnation of the Goddess of Knowledge). Rajchandra believed that the publicity gained by such ''Avadhāna''s may became an obstacle in spiritual pursuits, so he gradually discouraged the performances and stopped it completely by age of 20.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=132}} The performances attracted wide coverage in national newspapers.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=133}} In September 1893, when in Chicago, [[Virchand Gandhi]] mentioned this feat at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]].&lt;ref name="KarbhariGāndhī1911"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bhagu F. Karbhari|author2=Vīrchand Rāghavajī Gāndhī|title=The Jain Philosophy: Collected and Ed. by Baghu F. Karbhari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5kWQQAACAAJ|year=1911|publisher=N.M. Tripathi &amp; Company|pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===

In 1887 (Maha Sud 12, VS 1944), Rajchandra married to Zabakben, daughter of Popatlal, the elder brother of Revashankar Jagjivandas Mehta, a [[Zaveri]] merchant family. He then engaged in the pearls and diamond business.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raj1964"/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=135}} They had two sons and two daughters.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=135}} His in-laws wanted him to move to [[Bombay]] and establish business there, but he was interested in his spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt;

In 1890 (VS 1947), he experienced the [[self-realization]] for the first time at [[Uttarsanda]] where he was meditating under a mango tree near a lake. The tree no longer exists but a memorial shrine dedicated to the event is built there.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=135}} He continued his householder life for more six years and had been successful in his business.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=137}}

He is well known as a spiritual guide of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].{{snf|Salter|2002|p=145}} They were introduced in [[Mumbai]] in 1891 and had various conversations through letters while Gandhi was in South Africa. Gandhi noted his impression of Shrimad Rajchandra in his autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]'', calling Raichandbhai his "guide and helper" and his "refuge in moments of spiritual crisis". He advised Gandhi to be patient and to study [[Hinduism]] deeply. His teaching directly influenced Gandhi's non-violence philosophy.&lt;ref name="Weber2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA34|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|author=Thomas Weber|date=2 December 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt;{{snf|Salter|2002|p=145}}

[[File:Shrimad Rajchandra Vihar Idar2.jpg|thumb|Shrimad Rajchandra Vihar located on the [[Idar]] hill where Shrimad Rajchandra had given discourses.]]
He stayed in Gujarat with his disciples and avoided moving to Bombay. He retired from householder life and business when he was thirty. He spent three months in [[Idar]] where he had instructed seven monks in religious discourses sitting on a stone, ''pudhvi śila''. A memorial temple and a prayer hall is built there later.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=147–148}}&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt;

During his final years, he suffered a chronic digestive disorder. No specific cause of death was identified except extreme weakness. In 1900, he lost large amount of his weight. He was under medical supervision who had advised to move to coastal region of Gujarat for benefit of health. He contracted an illness during his stay in [[Dharampur, Gujarat]], from which he never recovered. In 1901, he, his mother, and wife stayed at Aga Khan's bungalow in [[Ahmedabad]] before moving to [[Wadhwan]] Camp. He died on 9 April 1901 (Chaitra Vad 5, VS 1957) in [[Rajkot]] (now in Gujarat) surrounded by his family, friends and disciples.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=149}}&lt;ref name="Raj1964"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shrimad Rajchandra|author2=Jagmandar Lal Jaini (rai bahadur)|title=The Atma-Siddhi: (or the Self-Realization) of Shrimad Rajchandra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9D_lAAAAMAAJ|year=1964|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Gyan Pracharak Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt; A small photograph taken after his death is displayed in a library in [[Khambhat]] established by him.

==Works==

Rajchandra wrote ''Stri Niti Bodhaka'' (The Nature of Ideal Moral Life for Women, 1884) in which he had advocated women's education as essential to national freedom. ''Sad-bodh-shatak'' (1884) is his work on ethical topics. ''Mokshamala'' (1887) is about self-liberation written in an easy style understandable to young people.&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt; Due to delay in the publication of ''Mokshamala'', he composed ''Bhavna Bodh'' for his readers. It was a small book of fifty pages in which he gave instructions to cultivate 12 sentiments to lead the life of non-attachment. He had composed ''Namiraja'', a work of five thousand verses explaining the nature of the four [[purushartha]]s. In ''Shurvir Smarana'' (1885), Rajchandra described the brave warriors of the past and compared them with their descendants who are not able to free India from British dominance.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;

In [[Atma Siddhi]], a Gujarati short verse poem, he propounds six fundamental truths on soul which are also known as ''satapada'' (six steps). He lays special emphasis on right perception ([[samyaktva]]), personal efforts and a true teacher’s guidance in the path to self-realisation. It is summary of his interpretation of Jainism.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt; It is adapted in a musical [[bhajan]] form by Shefali Shah. It is translated in English several times;  the first by J. L. Jaini in 1923. Its popular translation was published by Brahmachari Govardhandas in 1957.&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt;

He wrote more than 900 letters which charts his spiritual journey and teachings to disciples.&lt;ref name="Raj1964"/&gt; He also edited a newspaper, ''Vairagya Vilas''.&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;

''Shrimad Rajchandra'' or ''Vachanamrut'' is collection of his complete works including letters and other writings.

His several poems are popular including "Apoorva Avsar Evo Kyare Aavshe..", "Mool Marg Sambhlo Jinno Re..", "Bina Nayan Pavey Nahi..", "Hey Prabhu! Hey Prabhu! Shu Kahu..", "Yam Niyam Sanjam Aap Kiyo..", "Ichche Chhe Je Jogijan..". "Apoorva Avsar Evo Kyare Aavshe.." and "Hey Prabhu! Hey Prabhu! Shu Kahu.." were Mahatma Gandhi's favourite [[bhajan]]s and were included in the ''Ashram Bhajanavali''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gandhi|first1=Mahatma|title=Swar-Lipi-Mein-Ashram-Bhajanavali|publisher=Navjivan|isbn=817229266X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and commentaries===

Rajchandra wrote 51 quotes on ''Samyati Dharma'' (the religion of monk) as described in ''Dasha Vaikalika Siddhanta'' (VS 1945). It is Gujarati rendering of the original Magadhi text. He also wrote commentary on ''Moksha Siddhanta'' (VS 1953). He incompletely translated Chidanandji's ''Swarodayagyan''. He wrote an incomplete commentary on ''Chauvisi'' of [[Anandghan]].  In his three letters (No. 393, 394 and 395 printed in "Shrimad Rajchandra"), he commented on one of the couplets of sixth out of the eight perspective, ''Ath Yogdrashtini Sajjhaya'' composed by [[Yashovijaya]]. He wrote equivalent Gujarati translation of the first 100 verses of ''Atmanushasan''. He wrote on three ''Bhavna'' or Contemplations (''Anitya'', ''Asharan'' and a little on ''Sansara Bhavna'') out of [[Twelve Contemplations|12 ''Bhavna'']] described in ''Shri Ratnakarand Shravakaachar''. He completely translated ''Panchastikaya'' of [[Kundakunda]]. He had prepared an index on the ''Pragnavabodh'' (VS 1956).&lt;ref name="CSCSU"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Rajchandra was inspired by works of [[Kundakunda]] and [[Digambara]] mystical tradition and, in turn, inspired several spiritual teachers and followers including people from all [[Jain schools and branches|schools of Jainism]]. His followers sometimes consider his teaching as a new path of Jainism, neither [[Svetambara]] nor [[Digambara]], and revere him as a saint. His path is sometimes referred as ''Raj Bhakta Marg'', ''Kavipanth'', or ''Shrimadia'', which has mostly lay followers as was Rajchandra himself.&lt;ref name=Jainpedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Emma  (2002)  ''Raj Bhakta Marg: the path of devotion to Srimad Rajcandra.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Benkovic was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]]. He earned his B.S. degree in chemistry and an A.B. degree in English literature from [[Lehigh University]] in 1960. He earned his Ph.D in organic chemistry from [[Cornell University]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="kresge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kresge|first=Nicole |author2=Robert D. Simoni |author3=Robert L.

===Career===
Benkovic was a postdoc at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. There he and his advisor [[Thomas C. Bruice]] developed bioorganic textbooks that focused on enzyme catalysis. He joined the chemistry department at Penn State University in 1965. There, he uses the [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] [[DNA polymerase]] as a model system to explain the proficiency of enzymes.&lt;ref name="kresge" /&gt; He also uses the enzyme [[dihydrofolate reductase]] and the pathway for ''de novo'' purine biosynthesis to gain insights into enzymatic catalysis.

{{Chinese martial arts}}

'''Tai chi''' (taiji), short for '''T'ai chi ch'üan''', or '''Tai ji quan''' ([[Pinyin|pinyin]]: tàijíquán; 太极拳), is an [[neijia|internal]] [[Chinese martial art]] practiced for both its defense training and its health benefits. The term [[Taiji (philosophy)|''taiji'']] refers to a philosophy of the forces of [[yin and yang]], related to the moves. Though originally conceived as a [[martial art]], it is also typically practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: competitive wrestling in the format of [[pushing hands]] (''tui shou''), demonstration competitions and achieving greater [[longevity]]. As a result, a multitude of training forms exist, both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims with differing emphasis. Some training forms of tàijíquán are especially known for being practiced with relatively slow movements.

Today, tai chi has spread worldwide. Most modern styles of tai chi trace their development to at least one of the five traditional schools: [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Chen]], [[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Yang]], [[Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu (Hao)]], [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu]] and [[Sun-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Sun]]. All of the former, in turn, trace their historical origins to [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan#Chen Village (Chenjiagou)|Chen Village]].

==Overview==
The concept of the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|taiji]]'' ("supreme ultimate"), in contrast with ''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'' ("without ultimate"), appears in both [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Chinese philosophy]], where it represents the fusion or mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheng Man-ch'ing|title=Cheng-Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan|year=1993|page=21|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-0-938190-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[yin and yang]] into a single ultimate, represented by the ''[[taijitu]]'' symbol [[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|16px]]. Tàijíquán theory and practice evolved in agreement with many Chinese philosophical principles, including those of Taoism and Confucianism.

Tàijíquán training involves five elements, ''[[Taolu (martial arts)|taolu]]'' (solo hand and weapons routines/forms), ''[[neigong]]'' and ''[[qigong]]'' (breathing, movement and awareness exercises and meditation), ''[[tuishou]]'' (response drills) and ''[[sanshou]]'' (self defence techniques). While tàijíquán is typified by some for its slow movements, many styles (including the three most popular: [[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Yang]], [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu]] and [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Chen]]) have secondary forms with faster pace. Some traditional schools teach partner exercises known as ''[[tuishou]]'' ("pushing hands"), and martial applications of the postures of different forms (taolu).

In China, tàijíquán is categorized under the ''[[Wudang quan|Wudang]]'' grouping of Chinese martial arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun Lu Tang|title=Xing Yi Quan Xue|year=2000|page=3|publisher=Unique Publications|isbn=0-86568-185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, the arts applied with internal power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranne|first=Nabil|url=http://www.ctnd.de/wissenswertes/36/88-kraft-taijiquantqj-2010.html|title=Internal power in Taijiquan|publisher=CTND|accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term Wudang suggests these arts originated in the [[Wudang Mountains]], it is simply used to distinguish the skills, theories and applications of ''[[neijia]]'' (internal arts) from those of the [[Shaolinquan|Shaolin]] grouping, or ''[[waijia]]'' (hard or external) styles.&lt;ref name=Wile2007&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the earliest widespread promotion of the health benefits of tàijíquán by [[Yang Shaohou]], [[Yang Chengfu]], [[Wu Chien-ch'uan|Wu Chien-ch‘üan]] and [[Sun Lutang]] in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="Wile1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wile|first=Douglas|title=Lost T'ai-chi Classics from the Late Ch'ing Dynasty (Chinese Philosophy and Culture)|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7914-2654-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has developed a worldwide following of people, often with little or no interest in martial training, for its benefit to personal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)75012-1 |title=T'ai Chi gently reduces blood pressure in elderly |year=1999 |last1=Morris |first1=Kelly |journal=The Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9156 |page=904}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T'ai chi ch'uan#Health benefits|Medical studies of t‘ai-chi]] support its effectiveness as an alternative [[exercise]] and a form of [[martial arts therapy]].

It is purported that focusing the mind solely on the movements of the form helps to bring about a state of mental calm and clarity. Besides general health benefits and [[stress management]] attributed to tàijíquán training, aspects of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are taught to advanced students in some traditional schools.&lt;ref name="Wu2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wu|first=Kung-tsao|title=Wu Family T'ai Chi Ch'uan (吳家太極拳)|publisher=Chien-ch'uan T'ai-chi Ch'uan Association|year=2006|isbn=0-9780499-0-X}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other forms of martial arts require students to wear a uniform during practice. In general, tàijíquán schools do not require a uniform, but both traditional and modern teachers often advocate loose, comfortable clothing and flat-soled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2014-12-29|url=http://taichiforhealthinstitute.org/what-should-i-wear-to-practice-tai-chi-2/|title=What should I wear to practice Tai Chi?|publisher=Tai Chi for Health Institute|author=Lam, Dr. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fu |first=Zhongwen |title=Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan|date=2006-06-09|publisher=Blue Snake Books|location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-58394-152-5 |others=Louis Swaim}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical techniques of tàijíquán are described in the "[[T'ai chi classics|T‘ai-chi classics]]", a set of writings by traditional masters, as being characterized by the use of leverage through the joints based on coordination and relaxation, rather than muscular tension, in order to neutralize, yield or initiate attacks. The slow, repetitive work involved in the process of learning how that leverage is generated gently and measurably increases, as well as opens, the internal circulation ([[breath]], body heat, [[blood]], [[lymph]], [[peristalsis]]).

The study of tàijíquán primarily involves three aspects:
* Health: An unhealthy or otherwise uncomfortable person may find it difficult to meditate to a state of calmness or to use tàijíquán as a martial art. Tàijíquán's health training, therefore, concentrates on relieving the physical effects of stress on the body and mind. For those focused on tàijíquán's martial application, good physical fitness is an important step towards effective [[self-defense]].
* Meditation: The focus and calmness cultivated by the meditative aspect of tàijíquán is seen as necessary in maintaining optimum health (in the sense of relieving stress and maintaining [[homeostasis]]) and in application of the form as a [[soft style]] martial art.
* Martial art: The ability to use tàijíquán as a form of [[self-defense]] in [[combat]] is the test of a student's understanding of the art. Tàijíquán is the study of appropriate [[I Ching|change]] in response to outside forces, the study of yielding and sticking to an incoming attack rather than attempting to meet it with opposing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wong Kiew Kit|title=The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles|publisher=Element Books Ltd|date=November 1996|isbn=978-1-85230-792-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tàijíquán as a martial art is quite challenging and requires a great deal of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwfighting.com/Tai_Chi_Pushing_Hands.html|title=Tai Chi Push Hands|work=Northwest Fighting Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
''Tàijíquán'' and ''T‘ai-chi ch‘üan'' are two different [[transcribing|transcriptions]] of three [[Chinese characters]] that are the written Chinese name for the artform:&lt;br /&gt;
{| cellpadding="2" style="width:400px; border:1px solid darkgrey;"
|-
! [[Chinese Characters|Characters]] !! [[Wade–Giles]] !! [[Pinyin]] !! Meaning

| {{linktext|太極}} || t‘ai chi|| tàijí|| the source, the beginning
|- style="text-align:center;"
| {{linktext|拳}} || ch‘üan || quán || fist, boxing
|}

Despite the one [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] spelling, 太極拳, there are two different spellings in the English usage, one derived from the [[Wade–Giles]] and the other from the [[Pinyin]] [[transliteration|transcription]]. Most Westerners often shorten this name to ''t‘ai chi'' (often omitting the aspirate sign—thus becoming ''"tai chi"''). This shortened name is the same as that of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|''t‘ai-chi'' philosophy]], sometimes causing confusion of the two. The ''chi'' in the name of the martial art may also be mistaken for ''[[ch'i|ch‘i]]'', (''qi''  氣) the "life force," especially as ''ch‘i'' is involved in the practice of ''t‘ai-chi ch‘üan.'' &lt;br&gt;
Most Chinese, including many professional practitioners, masters, and martial arts bodies (such as the [[International Wushu Federation|IWUF]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209100055/http://iwuf.org/index.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;), use the Pinyin version.

===Historical origin===
From a modern historical perspective, when tracing tàijíquán's formative influences to [[Taoist]] and [[Buddhist]] monasteries, there seems little more to go on than legendary tales. Nevertheless, some traditional schools claim that tàijíquán has a practical connection to and dependence upon the theories of [[Song dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism]] (a conscious synthesis of Taoist, Buddhist, and [[Confucian]] traditions, especially the teachings of [[Mencius]]).&lt;ref name="Wile2007" /&gt; These schools believe that tàijíquán's theories and practice were formulated by the Taoist monk [[Zhang Sanfeng]] in the 12th century, at about the same time that the principles of the Neo-Confucian school were making themselves felt in Chinese intellectual life.&lt;ref name="Wile2007" /&gt; However, modern research casts serious doubts on the validity of those claims, pointing out that a 17th-century piece called "Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan" (1669), composed by Huang Zongxi (1610–1695), is the earliest reference indicating any connection between [[Zhang Sanfeng]] and martial arts whatsoever, and must not be taken literally but must be understood as a political metaphor instead. Claims of connections between tàijíquán and Zhang Sanfeng appeared no earlier than the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Henning|first =Stanley|title= Ignorance, Legend and Taijiquan|journal= Journal of the Chen Style Taijiquan Research Association of Hawaii|volume=2|issue=3|url=http://www.nardis.com/~twchan/henning.html|ref= CITEREFHenning1994|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History records that [[Yang Luchan]] trained with the Chen family for 18 years before he started to teach the art in Beijing, which strongly suggests that his art was based on, or heavily influenced by, [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|the Chen family art]]. The Chen family are able to trace the development of their art back to [[Chen Wangting]] in the 17th century. Martial arts historian Xu Zhen believed that the Taiji of Chen Village had been influenced by the ''Taizu changquan'' style practiced at the nearby [[Shaolin Monastery]], while [[Tang Hao]] thought it was derived from a treatise by the Ming dynasty general [[Qi Jiguang]], ''[[Jixiao Xinshu]]'' ("New Treatise on Military Efficiency"), which discussed several martial arts styles including ''Taizu changquan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/taiji/TJQorigins.html |title=presents...

TAIJIQUAN - Brief Analysis of Chen Family Boxing Manuals |website=Chinafrominside.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is now known as tàijíquán appears to have received this appellation from only around the mid of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A scholar in the Imperial Court by the name of Ong Tong He witnessed a demonstration by Yang Luchan at a time before Yang had established his reputation as a teacher. Afterwards Ong wrote: "Hands holding Taiji shakes the whole world, a chest containing ultimate skill defeats a gathering of heroes." Before this time the art may have had a number of different names, and appears to have been generically described by outsiders as ''zhan quan'' (沾拳, "touch boxing"), ''[[Mian Quan]]'' ("soft boxing") or ''shisan shi'' (十三式, "the thirteen techniques").{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History and styles==
{{See also|Chinese martial arts#History of Chinese Martial Arts|l1=History of Chinese Martial Arts}}

There are five major styles of tàijíquán, each named after the Chinese family from which it originated:
*[[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Chen style]] (陳氏) of [[Chen Wangting]] (1580–1660)
*[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Yang style]] (楊氏) of [[Yang Luchan]] (1799–1872)
*[[Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu Hao style]] (武氏) of [[Wu Yuxiang]] (1812–1880)
*[[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu style]] (吳氏) of [[Wu Quanyou]] (1834–1902) and his son [[Wu Jianquan]] (1870–1942)
*[[Sun-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Sun style]] (孫氏) of [[Sun Lutang]] (1861–1932)

The order of verifiable age is as listed above. The order of popularity (in terms of number of practitioners) is Yang, Wu, Chen, Sun and Wu/Hao.&lt;ref name="Wile2007"/&gt; The major family styles share much underlying theory, but differ in their approaches to training.

There are now dozens of new styles, hybrid styles, and offshoots of the main styles, but the five family schools are the groups recognized by the international community as being the orthodox styles. Other important styles are [[Zhaobao t'ai chi ch'uan|Zhaobao tàijíquán]], a close cousin of Chen style, which has been newly recognized by Western practitioners as a distinct style, the Fu style, created by [[Fu Chen Sung]], which evolved from Chen, Sun and Yang styles, and also incorporates movements from [[Baguazhang]] (Pa Kua Chang){{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and the [[Cheng Man-ch'ing]] style which is a simplification of the traditional Yang style.

[[Image:Eddie Wu Grasp Bird's Tail 1998.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu-style]] master [[Eddie Wu]] demonstrating the form "Grasp the bird's tail" at a tournament in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]]]

Most existing styles can be traced back to the Chen style, which had been passed down as a family secret for generations. {{citation needed span|The Chen family chronicles record [[Chen Wangting]], of the family's 9th generation, as the inventor of what is known today as tàijíquán. [[Yang Luchan]] became the first person outside the family to learn tàijíquán. His success in fighting earned him the nickname Yang Wudi, which means "Unbeatable Yang", and his fame and efforts in teaching greatly contributed to the subsequent spreading of tàijíquán knowledge.|date=July 2017}}
The designation ''internal'' or ''[[neijia]]'' martial arts is also used to broadly distinguish what are known as the ''external'' or ''[[waijia]]'' styles based on the ''[[Shaolinquan]]'' styles, although that distinction is sometimes disputed by modern schools. In this broad sense, ''all'' styles of t'ai chi, as well as related arts such as [[Baguazhang]] and [[Xingyiquan]], are, therefore, considered to be "soft" or "internal" martial arts.

===Tai chi in the United States of America===
Choy Hok Pang, a disciple of [[Yang Chengfu]], was the first known proponent of tàijíquán to openly teach in the United States of America in 1939. Subsequently, his son and student Choy Kam Man emigrated to San Francisco from Hong Kong in 1949 to teach t‘ai-chi ch‘üan in San Francisco's Chinatown. Choy Kam Man taught until he died in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Choy |first=Kam Man |title=Tai Chi Chuan|date=1985-05-05|publisher=Memorial Edition 1994|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Logan |first=Logan|title=Ting: The Caldron, Chinese Art and Identity in San Francisco|year=1970|publisher=Glide Urban Center|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sophia Delza]], a professional dancer and student of [[Ma Yueliang]], performed the first known public demonstration of tàijíquán in the United States at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City in 1954. She also wrote the first English language book on t‘ai-chi, "T‘ai-chi ch‘üan: Body and Mind in Harmony", in 1961. She taught regular classes at [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[Actors Studio]], and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|title=Sophia Delza Glassgold, 92, Dancer and Teacher|date=July 7, 1996|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/07/nyregion/sophia-delza-glassgold-92-dancer-and-teacher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Inventory of the Sophia Delza Papers, 1908-1996|publisher=Jerome Robbins Dance Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]|date=February 2006|url=https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/dandelza.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early practitioner of tàijíquán to openly teach in the United States was [[Cheng Man-ch'ing|Zheng Manqing]]/Cheng Man-ch'ing, who opened his school Shr Jung t‘ai-chi after he moved to New York from Taiwan in year 1964. Unlike the older generation of practitioners, Zheng was cultured and educated in American ways,{{clarify|date=July 2017}} and thus he was able to transcribe Yang's dictation into a written manuscript that became the de facto manual for Yang style. Zheng felt Yang's traditional 108-movement long form was unnecessarily long and repetitive, which makes it difficult to learn and make progress.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He thus created a shortened 37-movement version and taught that in his schools. Zheng's form became very popular and was the dominant form in the eastern United States until other teachers started to emigrate to the United States in larger numbers in the 90's. He taught until his death in 1975.&lt;ref name="Lowenthal1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfe Lowenthal|title=There Are No Secrets: Professor Cheng Man Ch'ing and His Tai Chi Chuan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ayJG1GU5Y4C|year=1991|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-55643-112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

====Modern forms====
The Cheng Man-ch‘ing (Zheng Manqing) and Chinese Sports Commission short forms are derived from Yang family forms, but neither is recognized as Yang family tàijíquán by standard-bearing Yang family teachers. The Chen, Yang, and Wu families are now promoting their own shortened demonstration forms for competitive purposes.

===Tàijíquán today===
[[Image:Tai Chi1.jpg|thumb|Outdoor practice in [[Beijing]]'s [[Temple of Heaven]].]]
{{See also|World Tai Chi and Qigong Day}}

In the last twenty years or so, tàijíquán classes that purely emphasise health have become popular in hospitals, clinics, as well as community and senior centres. This has occurred as the [[baby boomers]] generation has aged and the art's reputation as a low-stress training method for seniors has become better known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yip|first=Y. L.|title=Pivot&amp;nbsp;– Qi|journal=The Journal of Traditional Eastern Health and Fitness|volume=12|issue=3|publisher= Insight Graphics Publishers |date=Autumn 2002|issn=1056-4004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this popularity, there has been some divergence between those that say they practice tàijíquán primarily for self-defence, those that practice it for its [[aesthetic]] appeal (see ''[[Wushu (term)|wushu]]'' below), and those that are more interested in its benefits to physical and mental health. The ''wushu'' aspect is primarily for show; the forms taught for those purposes are designed to earn points in competition and are mostly unconcerned with either health maintenance or martial ability. More traditional stylists believe the two aspects of health and martial arts are equally necessary: the ''yin and yang'' of tàijíquán. The tàijíquán "family" schools, therefore, still present their teachings in a martial art context, whatever the intention of their students in studying the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolidge|first=Doug|title=T'AI CHI |journal=The International Magazine of T'ai Chi Ch'uan|volume=21|issue=3|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=June 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tàijíquán as sport====
In order to standardize t‘ai-chi ch‘üan for ''[[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]'' tournament judging, and because many tàijíquán teachers have either moved out of China or had been forced to stop teaching after the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the government sponsored the Chinese Sports Committee, who brought together four of their ''wushu'' teachers to truncate the Yang family hand form to [[24-form tai chi chuan|24 postures]] in 1956. They wanted to retain the look of tàijíquán, but create a routine that would be less difficult to teach and much less difficult to learn than longer (in general, 88 to 108 posture), classical, solo hand forms. In 1976, they developed a slightly longer form also for the purposes of demonstration that still would not involve the complete memory, balance, and coordination requirements of the traditional forms. This became the "Combined 48 Forms" that were created by three ''wushu'' coaches, headed by Men Hui Feng. The combined forms were created based on simplifying and combining some features of the classical forms from four of the original styles: Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun. As tàijíquán again became popular on the mainland, more competitive forms were developed to be completed within a six-minute time limit. In the late 1980s, the Chinese Sports Committee standardized many different competition forms. They developed sets to represent the four major styles as well as combined forms. These five sets of forms were created by different teams, and later approved by a committee of ''wushu'' coaches in China. All sets of forms thus created were named after their style: the "Chen-style national competition form" is the "56 Forms". The combined forms are "The 42-Form" or simply the "Competition Form". Another modern form is the "97 movements combined t‘ai-chi ch‘üan form", created in the 1950s; it contains characteristics of the Yang, Wu, Sun, Chen, and Fu styles blended into a combined form. The ''wushu'' coach [[Bow Sim Mark]] is a notable exponent of the "67 combined form".

These modern versions of tàijíquán have since become an integral part of international ''wushu'' tournament competition, and have been featured in popular movies, starring or [[choreography|choreographed]] by well-known ''wushu'' competitors, such as [[Jet Li]] and [[Donnie Yen]].

In the 11th [[Asian Games]] of 1990, ''wushu'' was included as an item for competition for the first time with the ''42-Form'' being chosen to represent t‘ai-chi ch‘üan. The [[International Wushu Federation]] (IWUF) applied for ''wushu'' to be part of the [[Olympic games]], but will not count medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.olympic.cn/08beijing/bocog/2006-10-17/945504.html|title=Wushu likely to be a "specially-set" sport at Olympics|year=2006|publisher=Chinese Olympic Committee|accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners also test their practical martial skills against students from other schools and martial arts styles in ''[[tuishou]]'' ("pushing hands") and ''[[sanshou]]'' competition.

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|T'ai chi ch'uan philosophy}}
The philosophy of tàijíquán is that, if one uses hardness to resist violent force, then both sides are certainly to be injured at least to some degree. Such injury, according to tàijíquán, is a natural consequence of meeting brute force with brute force. Instead, students are taught not to directly fight or resist an incoming force, but to meet it in softness and follow its motion while remaining in physical contact until the incoming force of attack exhausts itself or can be safely redirected, meeting ''yang'' with ''yin''. When done correctly, this ''yin/yang'' or ''yang/yin'' balance in combat, or in a broader philosophical sense, is a primary goal of tàijíquán training. [[Lao Tzu|Lao Tzŭ]] provided the [[archetype]] for this in the [[Tao Te Ching]] when he wrote, "The soft and the pliable will defeat the hard and strong."

Traditional schools also emphasize that one is expected to show ''[[Chinese martial arts#"Martial morality"|wude]]'' ("martial virtue/heroism"), to protect the defenseless, and show mercy to one's opponents.&lt;ref name="Wile1995"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Subsection to be added once it has some content
===Role of ''qi''===
--&gt;

==Training and techniques==
The core training involves two primary features: the first being ''[[taolu (martial arts)|taolu]]'' (solo "forms"), a sequence of movements which emphasize a straight spine, [[abdominal breathing]] and a natural range of motion; the second being different styles of ''[[tuishou]]'' ("pushing hands") for training movement principles of the form with a partner and in a more practical manner.

===Solo (''taolu'', ''neigong'' and ''qigong'')===
{{Further information|List of t'ai chi ch'uan forms}}

[[File:Taijiquan forms - Chenjiagou.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Painting in [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan#Chen Village (Chenjiagou)|''Chenjiagou'']], illustrating ''taolu'' according to the [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Chen style]] of tàijíquán.]]

The ''taolu'' (solo "forms") should take the students through a complete, natural range of motion over their [[centre of gravity]]. Accurate, repeated practice of the solo routine is said to retrain posture, encourage circulation throughout the students' bodies, maintain flexibility through their joints, and further familiarize students with the martial application sequences implied by the various forms. The major traditional styles of tàijíquán have forms that differ somewhat in terms of aesthetics, but there are also many obvious similarities that point to their common origin. The solo forms (empty-hand and [[weapon]]) are catalogues of movements that are practised individually in pushing hands and martial application scenarios to prepare students for self-defence training. In most traditional schools, different variations of the solo forms can be practised: fast / slow, small-circle / large-circle, square / round (which are different expressions of leverage through the joints), low-sitting / high-sitting (the degree to which weight-bearing knees are kept bent throughout the form), for example.

Breathing exercises; ''[[neigong]]'' (internal skill) or, more commonly, ''[[qigong]]'' (life energy cultivation) are practiced to develop ''[[qi]]'' (life energy) in coordination with physical movement and ''[[zhan zhuang]]'' (standing like a post) or combinations of the two. These were formerly taught only to disciples as a separate, complementary training system. In the last 60 years they have become better known to the general public.

====Qigong versus tàijíquán====
{{Main article|Qigong}}
''Qigong'' involves coordinated movement, breath, and awareness used for health, meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners consider tàijíquán to be a type of ''qigong'',&lt;ref name = yang_taiji&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Jwing-Ming | title = The Essence of Taiji Qigong, Second Edition : The Internal Foundation of Taijiquan (Martial Arts-Qigong) | year =1998  | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | location =  | isbn = 978-1-886969-63-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yeyoung_taichi_qigong&gt;{{cite web | last = YeYoung | first = Bing | year =  | title = Introduction to Taichi and Qigong | publisher = YeYoung Culture Studies: Sacramento, CA &lt;http://sactaichi.com&gt; | url = http://sactaichi.com/what-is-qi-gong | accessdate = 2012-01-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201235840/http://sactaichi.com/what-is-qi-gong/ | archive-date = 2014-02-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the two are commonly distinguished as separate but closely related practices, with ''qigong'' playing an important role in training for tàijíquán, and with many tàijíquán movements performed as part of qigong practice. The focus of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications. Internally the main difference is the flow of ''qi''. In qigong, the flow of ''qi'' is held at a gate point for a moment to aid the opening and cleansing of the channels.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} In tàijíquán, the flow of ''qi'' is continuous, thus allowing the development of power for the use by the practitioner.

===Partnered (''tuishou'' and ''sanshou'')===

[[Image:Pushing hands by yatish.jpg|thumb|left|Two students receive instruction in ''[[tuishou]]'' ("pushing hands"), one of the core training exercises of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan.]]

Tàijíquán's martial aspect relies on sensitivity to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as the primary goal of the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student.&lt;ref name="Wu2006"/&gt; The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first ''yin'' (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding ''yang'' (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through ''taolu'' (forms), ''[[tuishou]]'' (pushing hands), and ''[[sanshou]]'' (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. ''[[Chin na]]'', which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.

In addition to the physical form, martial tàijíquán schools also focus on how the energy of a strike affects the other person. A palm strike that looks to have the same movement may be performed in such a way that it has a completely different effect on the target's body. A palm strike that could simply push the opponent backward, could instead be focused in such a way as to lift the opponent vertically off the ground, breaking his/her centre of gravity; or that it could terminate the force of the strike within the other person's body with the intent of causing internal damage.

Most aspects of a trainee's tàijíquán development are meant to be covered within the
partnered practice of ''tuishou'', and so, ''sanshou'' (sparring) is not as commonly used as a method of training, but more advanced students sometimes do practice by ''sanshou''. ''Sanshou'' is more common to tournaments such as ''wushu'' tournaments.

==Health==
[[File:Lady does Tai Chi.jpg|thumb|A Chinese woman performs Yang-style tàijíquán]]
Tai chi has been reported as being useful in treating a number of human ailments, and is supported by a number of associations, including the [[National Parkinson Foundation]] and [[Diabetes Australia]]. However, [[Evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] of effectiveness was lacking and in recent years research has been undertaken to address this.&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; A 2017 systematic review found that it decreased the risk of falls in older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lomas-Vega|first1=R|last2=Obrero-Gaitán|first2=E|last3=Molina-Ortega|first3=FJ|last4=Del-Pino-Casado|first4=R|title=Tai Chi for Risk of Falls.

A 2011 comprehensive overview of [[systematic review]]s of tai chi recommended tai chi to older people for its various physical and psychological benefits. There was no conclusive evidence of benefit for any of the other conditions researched, including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name=Lee2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2010.080622|title=Systematic reviews of t'ai chi: An overview|year=2011|last1=Lee|first1=M. S.|last2=Ernst|first2=E.|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=10|pages=713–8|pmid=21586406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 systematic review found tai chi could be performed by those with chronic medical conditions such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[heart failure]], and [[osteoarthritis]] without worsening shortness of breath and pain, and found favorable effects on functional exercise capacity in people with these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of Tai Chi on four chronic conditions – cancer, osteoarthritis, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analyses|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/09/04/bjsports-2014-094388|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2015-09-17|issn =  1473-0480|pmid = 26383108|pages = bjsports-2014-094388|doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2014-094388|language = en|first = Yi-Wen|last = Chen|first2 = Michael A.|last2 = Hunt|first3 = Kristin L.|last3 = Campbell|first4 = Kortni|last4 = Peill|first5 = W.

In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; t‘ai-chi was one of 17 therapies evaluated and the conclusion was that there is very-low-quality evidence to suggest that tai chi may have some beneficial health effects when compared to control in a limited number of populations for a limited number of outcomes.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

==Seated tai chi==
[[File:Seated Tai Chi.jpg|thumb|Seated Tai Chi demonstration]]
Traditional tai chi was originally developed for self-defense, but tai chi has evolved into a graceful form of seated exercise that's now used for stress reduction and a variety of other health conditions. Often described as meditation in motion, seated tai chi promotes serenity through gentle, flowing movements. Worthy of note is the growing popularity of seated tai chi exercises touted by the medical community and researchers. Seated tai chi is based primarily on the Yang short form, and is being used by the general public, medical practitioners, and tai chi instructors in a growing elderly population. It would have been possible to simply take the well-known yang short form and 
redesign it for seated positions. There is, however, the matter of the integrity of the form itself. Within any tai chi form, there lies a certain inherent logic and purpose to each of the movements. The synchronization of the upper body with the steps and the breathing exists in a very carefully crafted order developed over hundreds of years, and the transition to seated positions is an important factor in the movements themselves. Research has shown that seated tai chi techniques can make big improvements to a person's physical and mental well being. Marked improvements in balance, blood pressure levels, flexibility and muscle strength, peak oxygen intake, and body fat percentages can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quarta|first1=Cynthia W.|title=Tai Chi in a Chair|date=2001|publisher=Fair Winds Press|isbn=1-931412-60-X|edition=first|url=https://www.healingtaichi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends and anecdotes==

[[Image:Yang cheng fu single whip application 2 75.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Yang Chengfu]] utilizing one of the many possible applications of the [[Single Whip]] technique]]

* During the Qing dynasty, a man named Wang Yuanwai living in Beipinggao village (about {{convert|10|km}} east of Chenjiagou), was threatened with death by a gang of highwaymen with bladed weapons, unless he surrendered his valuables. He sent for assistance from Chen Suole (see the lineage tree above), who was away according to his sons Chen Shenru and Chen Xunru – despite their being only around fifteen and sixteen years old, the boys volunteered their own help instead. They convinced the messenger to tell Wang Yuanwai to give the bandits liquor, discussed a plan and that night, traveled to the Wang residence in Beipinggao, where they jumped over the fence of the rear garden and there found Wang Yuanwai. He told them that the highwaymen, numbering around twenty, were drunken in his guest hall. While peeping in, Shenru pushed Xunru into the hall and extinguished several candles by throwing a bunch of peas at them. Xunru leapt onto beam and taunted, the panicked bandits who had seemingly started fighting each other, saying, "So you still will not hand over your weapons and surrender? Gods number one and two are here." Some tried to escape the frenzy, but were attacked by Shenru, who was still at the door.&lt;ref&gt;The Chen family chronicles{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1940s, a man known as "Big Spear Liu" came to Shanghai's "big world," the city's major performance and entertainment centre. Liu asked the doorkeeper, "Are there any good hands around here?", looking for a skilled opponent to challenge. The doorkeeper told "Big Spear Liu" of '''Tian Zhaolin''' (student of [[Yang Jianhou]]).  With that Liu set off to find him. He found Tian Zhaolin and immediately demanded to spar by each striking the other three times, to which Tian Zhaolin responded that it may not be necessary. He said, "Just let me touch you. If you can tolerate my touch, you win." Liu, sensing a fool and an effortless victory, immediately agreed. The two men approached and Tian Zhaolin reached out his hand to touch Liu's chest. Within a few moments, Liu's facial muscles started to contort. Soon he grimaced and his face showed signs of intense pain. Spear Liu pulled away and, after recovering, commented, "I have travelled throughout five provinces and various cities but until today I have never seen such a profound skill." Energy, including that of taijiquan, may be thought of as transmission by wave.  Earlier generation adepts in taijiquan had an expression—"hitting the cow on this side of the Mountain."  This phrase referred to hitting an opponent's front side with the pain and effect being felt on the back side.  In years past, people who sparred with [[Yang Shaohou]] often described him as also having an energy like electricity. That is, it caused very painful sensations in the muscle and even on the skin surface. Tian Zhaolin, coming from that background, also knew this method.&lt;ref name=aoe_tian&gt;{{cite web | last =Clark | first =Leroy | last2 =Sun | first2 =Key | title =Tian Zhaolin: A Legacy of Yang Taiji | publisher =Art-of-Energetics.com | url =http://www.art-of-energetics.com/New/tian_zhaolin.htm | accessdate =2012-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1945, '''Hu Yuen Chou''', a student of [[Yang Chengfu]], defeated a Russian boxer by TKO in a full-contact match in Fut San, [[China]].
*At the age of 60, '''[[Huang Sheng Shyan]]''' demonstrated his abilities in taijiquan by defeating Liao Kuang-Cheng, the Asian champion wrestler, 26 throws to 0 in a fund raising event in [[Kuching]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taijiquan.co.nz/journey.htm|title=THE TAIJI JOURNEY OF HUANG SHENG-SHYAN|accessdate=2008-12-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612175639/http://www.taijiquan.co.nz/journey.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attire and ranking==
[[File:Master Yang Jun Bend The Bow Shoot The Tiger.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yang Jun (martial artist)|Master Yang Jun]] in demonstration attire that has come to be identified with taijiquan]]
In practice traditionally there is no specific uniform required in the practice of tàijíquán. Modern day practitioners usually wear comfortable, loose T-shirts and trousers made from [[Breathability|breathable natural fabrics]], that allow for free movement during practice. Despite this, t‘ai-chi ch‘üan has become synonymous with "t‘ai-chi uniforms" or "[[kung fu]] uniforms" that usually consist of loose-fitting traditional Chinese styled trousers and a long or short-sleeved shirt, with a [[Mandarin collar]] and buttoned with [[Chinese frog]] buttons. The long-sleeved variants are referred to as Northern-style uniforms, whilst the short-sleeved, Southern-style uniforms. The colour of this clothing is usually, all white, all black, black and white, or any other colour, mostly being either all a single solid colour or a combination of 2 colours: one colour being the actual clothing and the binding being a contrasting colour. They are normally made from natural fabrics such as [[cotton]] or [[silk]]. These ''uniforms'' are not a requirement, but rather are usually worn by masters &amp; professional practitioners during demonstrations, tournaments and other public exhibitions.

There is no standardized tàijíquán ranking system, except the Chinese Wushu Duan wei exam system run by the Chinese wushu association in Beijing. However, most schools do not use belt rankings. Some schools may present students with belts depicting rank, similar to ''[[Dan (rank)|dans]]'' in [[Japanese martial arts]]. A simple uniform element of respect and allegiance to one's teacher and their methods and community, belts also mark hierarchy, skill, and accomplishment of practice in one school's style and system. During ''[[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]'' tournaments, masters and grandmasters often wear "''kung fu uniforms''"  which tend to have no belts. Wearing a belt signifying rank in such a situation would be unusual.

==Tai Chi as a generic brand==
[[File:Associació Catalana de Choy Li Fut, Tai Chi Chuan i Chi Kung.jpg|thumb|right|Taijiquan form (Taijiquan Taolu) at the Associació Catalana de Choy Li Fut, Tai Chi Chuan i Chi Kung.]]
From roughly the mid-1990s onward, Tai Chi has gained a popularity in some countries to the point of it becoming nearly as known as a health-oriented practice as [[Yoga]]. In fact, in modern times it is even more known for such benefits and methods of practice than it is known for its original purpose{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

A new phenomenon (since the 2000s) is of various martial arts styles claiming a historical relationship or otherwise with Taiji Quan, because of its popularity. A branch of Lama Pai known as "Tibetan White Crane" had popularized a slow-movement form by naming it "Needle in Cotton" (a common term describing Taiji Quan mechanics), and referring to its practice as "Tai Chi". However, there is no relationship between these arts, historic or otherwise.
A similar phenomenon occurs with the usage of the art's name as a universal brand for promoting various fitness programs, books and videos. There is, for instance, a book that describes how to use the training principles of Tai Chi to run better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chirunning.com/ |title=Chi Running |publisher=Chi Running |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the questions of whether such claims are viable, these are all new trends, which historically were not endorsed or promoted by teachers of the art.

==In popular culture==
* Waterbending in ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005-2008) and ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' (2012-2014) is modeled on Taijiquan.&lt;ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atla.avatarspirit.net/martialarts.php&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series, the character Leifang is a taijiquan prodigy.

* In the TV show [[Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] the character of [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters|Agent Melinda May]] uses Tai Chi and later taught it to [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters|Agent Skye/Daisy Johnson]], the superhero known as [[Daisy Johnson|Quake]].

'''Ted Honderich''' (born 30 January 1933) is a Canadian-born British philosopher, Grote Professor [[Emeritus]] of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic, [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crace|first=John|title=Ted Honderich: philosophy with attitude|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/mar/22/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|accessdate=21 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been mainly about five things: [[consciousness]] and mind, including the consciousness–brain relation; right and wrong in the contemporary world particularly with democracy, terrorism and war; advocacy of the Principle of Humanity; [[determinism]] and freedom; particular problems in logical analysis and metaphysics; the supposed justification of punishment by the state; the political tradition of conservatism. He has given lectures and talks in British, continental European, Irish, American, Canadian, Asian, Russian, and African  universities.

==Biography==
Honderich was born Edgar Dawn Ross Honderich on 30 January 1933 in Baden, Ontario, Canada.  An undergraduate at the [[University of Toronto]], qualifying as [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. (Hons)]] in Philosophy and English Literature, he came to [[University College London]] to study under the logical positivist and Grote Professor [[A. J. Ayer]], graduating with a PhD in 1968.  He has since lived in England and become a British citizen.  After being a lecturer at the [[University of Sussex]] he became lecturer, reader, professor and then [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic | Grote Professor]] at University College London.  He was visiting professor at the Graduate Center of the [[City University of New York]], [[Yale]] and the universities of Bath and Calgary.  He is author of many books and articles on such subjects as consciousness, determinism, qualia, functionalism, timings of sensory experiences, psychophysical intimacy, the correspondence theory of [[truth]], Russell's theory of descriptions, time, [[Causality|causation]], Mill's ''On Liberty'', [[John Searle]]'s view of [[free will]] and [[G. A. Cohen]]'s defence of [[Marx's theory of history]].  He has also edited several series of philosophy books.

He has been involved in controversy for his moral defence of [[Palestinian political violence]], despite his justification of the founding and maintaining of [[Israel]] in its original 1948 borders.

His papers in philosophical journals have been published in three volumes by Edinburgh University Press.  He has appeared on radio and television, is the editor of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', has written a philosophical autobiography and is chairman of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] where he inaugurated the annual lectures subsequently published as ''Philosophers of Our Times''. He is married to Ingrid Coggin Honderich.

==Consciousness==
Honderich's theory of consciousness in the long book ''Actual Consciousness'' and the precis-book ''Your Being Conscious is What? Where?'' replaces entirely his philosophy of mind in ''A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes'' and the precis-book ''How Free Are You?''. The new theory  derives from a database to the effect that being conscious, figuratively speaking, is something's being actual. This issues, by way of (a) speculation that disagreement about consciousness is significantly owed to no adequate initial clarification of the subject matter, and (b) examination of five leading ideas of consciousness and existing theories of consciousness, and (c) a specification of the objective physical world, into the wholly literal theory or analysis of the nature of consciousness called Actualism. It distinguishes three sides of consciousness: (1) perceptual consciousness -- consciousness in perception, (2) cognitive consciousness, and (3) affective consciousness. In each case the theory satisfies the two primary criteria of explaining what is actual, and what its being actual consists in. In the case of perceptual consciousness what is actual is only a subjective physical world out there. I.e. being perceptually conscious is essentially or primarily a state of affairs external to the perceiver. Its being actual is its being subjectively physical, which is specified. In the case of cognitive and affective consciousness, what is actual is representations, internal to the conscious thing, and their being actual is their being subjectively physical, differently so from subjective physical worlds. Actualism argues, further, that it satisfies further criteria better than other existing theories of consciousness including one of subjectivity, individuality or personal identity, and that it is relevant to desires for human standing that are the motivation of beliefs in free will as against determinism. Actualism has been received as a new and arguabletheory by philosophers who have previously declared the urgent need for one. A predecessor of the theory is discussed by 11 others philosophers in ''Radical Externalism: Honderich's Theory of Consciousness Discussed'', ed. Anthony Freeman, Imprint Academic.

==Determinism and freedom==
In ''A Theory of Determinism:  The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes'' and in the precis-book ''How Free Are You?'', Honderich expounds a theory of [[Causality|causation]] as well as other lawlike connections.  This he uses to formulate three hypotheses of a deterministic [[philosophy of mind]].  They are argued to be true, mainly on the basis of neuroscience.  The clarity of [[determinism]] is contrasted with the obscurity of the doctrines of [[free will]] or origination.

The centuries-dominant philosophical traditions of determinism and freedom, [[Compatibilism]] and [[Incompatibilism]], are examined.  According to the first, determinism is consistent with our freedom and moral responsibility; according to the second, it is inconsistent with them.  Honderich considers Compatibilism's argument that our freedom consists in voluntariness, doing what we desire and not being coerced; hence its conclusion that determinism and freedom can go together.  He also examines Incompatibilism's argument that our freedom consists in origination or free will, our choosing without our choosing's being caused; hence the conclusion that determinism and freedom are inconsistent.

Honderich argues that both views are mistaken, since freedom as voluntariness and freedom as origination are each as fundamental to our lives.  The real problem of the consequences of determinism is not choosing between the two traditional doctrines, but a more practical one:  trying to give up what must be given up, since we do not have the power of origination.  Honderich's rejection of both traditions has been taken up by other philosophers, many of whom find his criticisms decisive.

==Mind and brain==
Honderich's Union Theory of mind and brain is defended in ''A Theory of Determinism''.  The Union Theory takes it as possible that conscious events like our choices and decisions are in a way subjective but are nevertheless physical rather than near-physical events.  They stand in a kind of lawlike connection with neural events, sometimes called the [[supervenience]] of mental events on neural events.  These psychoneural pairs, as Honderich calls them, are just effects of certain causal sequences, and are causes of our actions.  This sort of physicalism, a predecessor to the notion of supervenience, has since been succeeded in Honderich's writings by the near-physicalism of Radical [[Externalism]].  Radical Externalism holds that perceptual consciousness does not have a nomic sufficient condition in a head but only a necessary one.  Honderich argues that reflective and affective consciousness are different again.  He also argues that this is consistent with contemporary [[neuroscience]], rescues us from the [[argument from illusion]] or [[brain in a vat]], and also from the dubious conclusions of [[sense-data]] theory and [[phenomenalism]].

==The Principle of Humanity==
Honderich argues that the Principle of Humanity is that what is right always consists in what, according to the best available knowledge and judgement, are actually rational steps, effective and not self-defeating ones rather than pretences, to the end of getting and keeping people out of bad lives.  Bad lives are defined as those deprived of six fundamental human goods:  a decent length of life, bodily well-being, freedom and power in various settings, respect and self-respect, the goods of relationship, and the goods of culture.  It is a [[consequentialist]] principle, but not the [[principle of utility]], nor of course the claim that the ends justify the means.  Honderich argues that the principle is fundamental to but not the whole of a morality of humanity.  This, he claims, includes certain policies of equality and inequality and certain practices, one being a better democracy than we have.  Honderich concludes that the Principle of Humanity is better supported than any other sort of moral principle, on the basis of both consistency and certain facts.  He takes it that non-consequentialist reasons are not really reasons at all, nor, he says, does the Principle grant any distinction between acts and omissions.

==International right and wrong, democracy, terrorism==
Following [[9/11]], Honderich published ''After the Terror''.  The author first lays out premises for what he terms the "bad lives" and "good lives", of those living in Africa and in rich countries respectively.  With respect to bad lives, Honderich argues that our omissions have resulted in 20 million years of possible living-time lost by a certain sample of Africans.  He also considers the creation of [[Israel]] in 1948 and records what he describes as the bad lives of Palestinians as a result of what is called the neo-Zionist expansion of Israel since the 1967 war.  Honderich asks whether those in the rich societies do wrong in doing nothing about bad lives.  He considers [[natural morality]] as well as our worked-out or philosophical moralities.  Such outlooks as [[political realism]] and such ideologies as liberalism and [[libertarianism]] are also considered, as is what Honderich calls 'hierarchic democracy'.  The Principle of Humanity is used to judge our moral responsibility for the many bad lives, which Honderich tells us is great.  The Principle also condemns the terrorist killings of 11 September as hideous.  The killings were not rational means to an end that was partly defensible.  The West's subsequent attack on [[Afghanistan]] is excused.  But the taking from Palestinians of at least their freedom in the last fifth of their homeland, historic [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], is condemned.  Honderich writes:  '...the Palestinians have had a moral right to their terrorism as certain as was the moral right, say, of the African people of South Africa against their white captors and the apartheid state'.

Honderich claims that we need to see the power of our societies as deadly.  Americans, first of all, because of their unique power, need to think more carefully about their actions.  He also argues that we should supplement our democracies with the transformations of the civil disobedience of [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and those in Eastern Europe who brought down the wall.

His later book, ''Humanity, Terrorism, Terrorist War:  Palestine, 9/11, Iraq, 7/7...'' begins by asking if analytic philosophy in considering large questions of right and wrong should proceed by embracing [[international law]], human rights, [[just war theory]] or the like.  Honderich, finding these means of judgement wanting, again takes up the Principle of Humanity.  The book justifies and defends Zionism, defined as the creation of Israel in its original borders, but also reaffirms that Palestinians have had a moral right to their liberation—to terrorism within historic Palestine against what Honderich calls the ethnic cleansing of Neo-Zionism, the expansion of Israel beyond its original borders.  After a further consideration of 9/11, there is an analysis of 10 reasons for what he calls 'our terrorist war' in Iraq.  Honderich condemns the war as morally barbaric, given the foreseen and thus intentional killing of many innocents.  In condemning the 7/7 terrorist attack on London, Honderich considers the importance of horror to morality.  He also argues that [[Tony Blair]] and [[George W. Bush]] are friends rather than enemies of terrorism.  The book ends with a postscript on the charge of anti-semitism against critics of neo-Zionism&amp;nbsp;– a charge Honderich says is principally a part of Neo-Zionism or at least something insufficiently detached from it.

In January 2011, Honderich wrote a letter to the Guardian on terrorism, in response to details released about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process:
{{quote|[T]he Palestinians have a moral right to their terrorism within historic Palestine against neo-Zionism. The latter, neither Zionism nor of course Jewishness, is the taking from the Palestinians of at least their autonomy in the last one-fifth of their historic homeland. Terrorism, as in this case, can as exactly be self-defence, a freedom struggle, martyrdom, the conclusion of an argument based on true humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/26/critics-should-respect-my-decision?INTCMP=SRCH Israel critics should respect my decision] Letters, The Guardian, Wednesday 26 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Punishment==
In ''Punishment:  The Supposed Justifications'', Honderich surveys and analyses 14 traditional, backward-looking reasons for the justification of [[punishment]] by the [[State (polity)|state]].  Most have to do with desert or [[Retributive justice|retribution]], others with annulment or consent.  All are found to be weak or worse.  Honderich then argues that the strong tradition of punishment must have in it some real content or argument.  This is found to be that punishment is justified by giving satisfaction to grievance-desires—doing no more than satisfying them.  This, Honderich concludes, is the reality of [[retributivism]], but it cannot be an effective justification of punishment.  The Utilitarian prevention theory of punishment is also rejected, because it justifies certain victimisations.  Mixed theories of punishment, drawing on backward-looking considerations as well as the notion of prevention, sometimes in terms of the reform of offenders, are also found to be untenable.  Robert Nozick's theory in particular is examined.  Honderich's conclusion is that the long-running problem of the justification of punishment is now dead.  Its justification must be in terms of its consequences—in discouraging and licensing certain kinds of behaviour.  The live issue is determining what these are.  Honderich's answer has to do with the Principle of Humanity.  Punishment is or would be justified when it rationally takes forward the humanisation of our societies.  He argues, on the basis of this, that most punishments are in fact wrong.

==Conservatism==
Honderich's book ''Conservatism'' begins with a general inquiry into the distinctions between British and American conservatism.  He argues that one has to do with eternal values and therefore with reform rather than change, a view underpinning Edmund Burke's condemnation of the [[French Revolution]] and all conservatives since.  Other distinctions have to do with the right kind of political thinking and with human nature, with particular doctrines of incentive and reward, and with certain freedoms, including those of private property.  Given these distinctions which set conservatism apart from other views, Honderich asks what underlies and brings these distinctions together.  What is the rationale or underlying principle of conservatism?  The answer he gives is not just that the conservative tradition is selfish.  Its self-interest, he argues, does not distinguish it from other political traditions.  What does distinguish it, Honderich concludes, is that it lacks a moral principle to defend its self-interest.  It is unique in its [[amorality]].  ''Conservatism'' was enlarged as ''Conservatism:  Burke, Nozick, Bush, Blair?'' in 2005, and includes Honderich's consideration of whether Britain's [[New Labour|New Labour Party]] is truly in the conservative political tradition.

==Controversy==
Honderich has been involved in controversy since the publication of his book ''After the Terror'' in 2002.  Honderich arranged with [[Oxfam]] in Britain and the publisher of ''After the Terror'', Edinburgh University Press, to have the £5,000 advance on royalties go to the charity, along with more money from the publishers.  The Canadian newspaper ''The Globe and Mail'' suggested that Oxfam was taking money from a terrorist sympathiser, and it then declined the contributions, for which it was judged adversely in the British media.  The book was published in a German translation.  [[Micha Brumlik]], director of a Holocaust centre and Professor of Pedagogy at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], demanded publicly that the book be withdrawn from sale by the publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag.  Despite the declaration by the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]], who had recommended the translation, that the book was not anti-semitic, it was withdrawn from sale.  Honderich demanded the dismissal of Brumlik from his professorship, for violation of academic principle.  There was a media furore in Germany.  The book was retranslated and republished by an antizionist Jewish publishing house, Melzer Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/BrumlikSumbyTH.html T. Honderich, ''The Rise and Fall of a Book in Germany'', March (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser controversies have included an imputation of anti-semitism by a student newspaper in London, against which Honderich took successful legal action.  There have been attacks by Palestinians on Honderich's justification of Zionism too, including disruptions at meetings.&lt;ref&gt;T. Honderich, ''On Being Persona Non Grata to Palestinians Too'' CounterPunch, March (2005) {{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/honderich02192005.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823105212/http://www.counterpunch.org/honderich02192005.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other writings==
Honderich wrote a number of papers in criticism of Donald Davidson's [[Anomalous Monism]], and in particular made the objection that on certain assumptions the view is [[epiphenomenalist]].  The papers are reprinted in ''Mental Causation and the Metaphysics of Mind'', edited by Neil Campbell.  Earlier journal papers are about Austin's [[correspondence theory of truth]], [[Causality|causation]], time, Russell's [[theory of descriptions]], and John Stuart Mill's essay ''On Liberty''.  Honderich's philosophical autobiography, ''Philosopher:  A Kind of Life'', is a personal and general picture of English academic life over several decades.  An encyclopaedia edited by him, ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', is in its second edition.

'''''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America''''' is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning 2001 book by [[Louis Menand]], an American writer and legal scholar, which won the 2002 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]].  The book recounts the lives and intellectual work of the handful of thinkers primarily responsible for the [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept of [[pragmatism]], a principal feature of American philosophical achievement: [[William James]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and [[John Dewey]]. Pragmatism proved to be very influential on modern thought, for example, in spurring movements in modern legal thought such as [[legal realism]].

Menand traces the biography of each of these individuals, shows ways in which they were connected and how all were in a sense influenced by their times and by thinkers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The book begins by examining the family history and early life of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., the future [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice, then describes how Holmes, James, Peirce, Dewey and others were acquainted with each other, and how their association led to James' development of pragmatism.

A main focus of the book is the influence of the [[American Civil War]] on Americans in general and on the subjects of this book, as well as how the Civil War inspired pragmatism. For Holmes, the Civil War destroyed his entire perspective on the world and greatly shaped his judicial philosophy. Holmes's judicial philosophy developed at roughly the same time as Dewey, James and Peirce were beginning to develop pragmatist ideas.  Other influences treated by the book are the emerging sciences of [[statistics]] and [[evolution|evolutionary biology]].

Menand's portrayal of pragmatism has been criticized by philosophers [[Susan Haack]],&lt;ref&gt;Haack, Susan (1997), "Vulgar Rortyism" in ''The New Criterion'', v. 16, n. 3, November 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">"'''The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories'''" is a 1976 paper in [[ethics]] by Michael Stocker. Published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', the central claim of the paper is that some modern ethical theories fail to account for [[motivation|motive]] in their theories, producing a sort of [[schizophrenia]] because the agent is unable to use his reasons or motives as a basis for his actions. According to Stocker, motive is important to ethics and should be considered as well, rather than only "duty, rightness and obligation" which he believes are the main focuses of current theories. Stocker believes that this focus is not compatible with the motives required for goods such as [[love]] and [[friendship]].

Stocker uses the example of a friend visiting you in the hospital. It is nice at first, however he reveals that he chose to spend time with you not out of concern for you in particular, but because he felt it was his moral [[duty]]. In this case, we feel that there is something missing in this action—we would much prefer to be visited by someone who cares about us directly, not just his duty.

'''William Brede Kristensen''' (21 June 1867 in [[Kristiansand]] – 25 September 1953 in [[Leiden]]) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[historian of religion]].&lt;ref name="Waardenburg1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Waardenburg|title=Classical Approaches to the Study of Religion: Aims, Methods and Theories of Research. Introduction and Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2-iTeKaiYQC&amp;pg=PA390|accessdate=15 August 2013|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080072-2|pages=390–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristensen completed [[secondary school]] in 1884. For a short while he studied [[theology]], but from the fall of 1887 he concentrated on [[history of religion]], first in [[Kristiania]], later (1890–92) at [[Leiden University]] under Professor [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele]] and 1892–93 in [[Paris]] under [[Gaston Maspero]].&lt;ref name="Hjelde2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sigurd Hjelde|title=Man, Meaning, and Mystery: 100 Years of History of Religions in Norway : the Heritage of W.

In 1896 he received his ''[[Doctor Philosophiae (Danish and Norwegian degree)|Doctor Philosophiae]]'' from the [[Oslo University|University of Kristiania]] on a thesis titled ''The Egyptians' Conceptions of Life after Death in Relation to the Gods Ra and Osiris'' (''Ægypternes Forestillinger om Liv efter Døden i Forbindelse med Guderne Ra og Osiris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk Bokfortegnelse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU8bAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 August 2013|year=1899|publisher=A. Cammermeyer.|language=Norwegian|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristensen was granted a scholarship, combined with the duty of giving lectures at University of Kristiania in 1898. In 1901 he became the successor of Professor [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] in history of religion and [[Phenomenology of religion]] at Leiden University, a professorship he held until his retirement in 1937.&lt;ref name="Jordan2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Henry Jordan|title=Comparative Religion: Its Genesis &amp; Growth 1905|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBks2tgo_zAC&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=15 August 2013|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-3910-7|pages=194–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Kristensen can be seen as the anchorman of Dutch Phenomenology of religion.&lt;ref&gt;See also the lemma on [[Phenomenology of religion]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena.  Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;George James. 1995.

'''William Cleghorn''' (1718 – August 1754) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] philosopher. He was born to a successful [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Brewing|brewer]], Hugh Cleghorn, and Jean Hamilton, and died in 1754, aged 36.&lt;ref name="nobbs"&gt;Nobbs, Douglas. 1965. 'The Political Ideas of William Cleghorn, Hume's Academic Rival'. ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 26, No. 4: 575–86&lt;/ref&gt; William Cleghorn held the Chair of [[Philosophy of mind|Pneumatics]] and [[Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1745 until his death in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/info/history.html  Some Notes on the History of the Philosophy Department]', University of Edinburgh website (accessed 9 Sept 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; Four volumes of notes on Cleghorn's lectures on moral philosophy from 1746–47 are stored at the University of Edinburgh library.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.dswebhosting.info/SCAN/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Site20&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo=='GB237/Dc.3.3-6')  Lectures of Professor William Cleghorn]', Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleghorn: David Hume's rival==
Cleghorn is primarily remembered for being a rival of the more famous philosopher [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="nobbs"/&gt; In 1744 and 1745, Hume and Cleghorn were competing candidates for the position of Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Hume was arguably the better of the two candidates. He is clearly of greater historical importance. However, the town council appointed Cleghorn to the position on 5 June 1745. Hume was an [[atheism|atheist]], and it is known that many of the ministers of Edinburgh opposed his appointment to the Chair's position, and petitioned the town council, describing Hume as [[amorality|amoral]], an atheist, and a [[skepticism|sceptic]]. It has been suggested that a clique of people who disliked Hume's personal beliefs arranged for Cleghorn to be given the Chair's position at the University. However, some historians believe that Cleghorn was appointed to the position, not because of rivalry based on personal beliefs, but rather because of rivalry between two competing schools of thought on moral philosophy.&lt;ref name="nobbs"/&gt;

==Cleghorn and Adam Ferguson==
Cleghorn was a friend, and probably also teacher, of [[Adam Ferguson]]. It is thought that one of the characters in Ferguson's philosophical work ''Dialogue on a Highland Jaunt'' is based on Cleghorn.&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, Ernest Campbell. 1963. 'Adam Ferguson's "Dialogue on a Highland Jaunt" with Robert Adam, William Cleghorn, David Hume, and William Wilkie'. In Carroll Camden (ed.), ''Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Literature''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press: 297–308&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that Cleghorn recommended, shortly before his death, that Ferguson be given the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy once he had died. Ferguson was not given the Chair at this time, although he was given it later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10583">{{other people|William Sweet}}
'''William Sweet''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]], and a past president of the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]].

==Biography==
Sweet studied [[political science]], [[theology]], and philosophy in Canada, France, and Germany. He completed a DEA in political science at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] at the Université de Paris (with [[Luc Ferry]]), a PhD in philosophy at the University of Ottawa, and a D.Ph. at the Université Saint-Paul. He also studied at [[Carleton University]], the [[University of Manitoba]], the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]], and the [[Centre Sèvres]], (Faculté de Théologie de la Compagnie de Jésus, Paris). He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 2014, and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 2017.

Sweet specializes in [[political philosophy]] (particularly on issues of [[human rights]]); the [[philosophy of religion]] (e.g., the influence of science and technology on religion and, broadly, epistemology of religion); the relation of culture and tradition to philosophical thinking (particularly, comparative Asian and Western philosophy); late 19th and early 20th century Anglo-American Philosophy (particularly, the origins of [[analytic philosophy]] and [[British Idealism]]); ethical theories and applied [[ethics]] (especially, cross-cultural ethics); and the philosophy of [[Jacques Maritain]].

==Academic positions==
Sweet is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Centre for Philosophy, Theology, and Cultural Traditions at [[St Francis Xavier University]]. He has been also a member of the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies at the [[University of Ottawa]], and serves as an adjunct professor in the graduate programmes of [[Saint Paul University]] and of the [[Dominican University College|Collège dominicain de philosophie et de théologie]] in Ottawa, Canada. Sweet was Professor of Philosophy and Professor of Religious Studies at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St Thomas University]] in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where he served as the Vice President (Academic) from 2007 to 2008. He has also been a Visiting Professor at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]], Poland, [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]], Taipei, [[Fu Jen Catholic University|Fu Jen University]], Taipei, and the [[Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram]] and the [[University of Pune]], in India.

==Contributions==
Much of Sweet's work is in the history of modern philosophy, although he uses this as a resource and a vehicle to address contemporary issues in political philosophy, applied ethics, and the philosophy of religion. His early essays as well as his first book focused on the political philosophy of British idealist philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th century, but he has published a number of papers and translations on the personalist tradition in French philosophy, particularly that of [[Jacques Maritain]]. Recent research focuses on philosophical debates in the 20th century in [[South Africa]] and [[India]], and the phenomenon of the migration of philosophical texts and traditions across cultures.

The focus of several of Sweet's articles and books in [[political philosophy]] is the theme of rights and obligations. Much of this has been historical – providing substantial and novel reassessments of British idealists such as [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] but also of [[Maritain]] (who, Sweet argues, converge on a number of significant points). Sweet's view is that these traditions provide a basis for a liberal, but non-individualistic, political philosophy. He gives a brief account of a positive theory of idealist ethics in his Introductory essay to his edited volume on ''The Moral, Social, and Political Philosophy of the British Idealists'' (2009), and he defends a broadly Maritainian view of dignity and human rights in a number of recent essays.

Sweet's contributions to the philosophy of religion are developed over two single authored, one co-authored, and several edited books. Sweet was a student of [[D.Z. Phillips]], and much of his work has been on the epistemology of religion and the nature of religious belief. Sweet argues that much of the debate in the Anglo-American traditions concerning the relation of faith and reason is based on assumptions concerning the meaning and truth of religious beliefs – assumptions which he traces to the early 17th century. Sweet argues that these accounts misrepresent or misunderstand what religious belief is, and that a more accurate account of religious belief (which requires recognizing both the descriptive and expressive character of religious beliefs), and a broadly coherentist theory of truth can be used to address a number of contemporary issues in the philosophy of religion, such as the relation of religion and science.

Sweet travels extensively, and regularly lectures or teaches in East Asia, India, and Western Europe. He has been a major contributor to the international programmes of the [[Council for Research in Values and Philosophy]] and of the ''World Union of Catholic Philosophical Associations'' and the ''Istituto Internazionale Jacques Maritain'' (of which he is ''Presidente d'onore'').

He is the editor of ''Philosophy, Culture, and Traditions'' and an Editor of ''Collingwood and British Idealism Studies.'' He has also been editor of ''Etudes maritainiennes/Maritain Studies'' (1994–2006) and ''Bradley Studies'' (2005).

His work has been published in [[Castilian language|Castilian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Gallego]], [[German language|German]], Italian, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Polish language|Polish]],  and Vietnamese.

'''William of Auvergne''' (1180/90–1249) was a [[France|French]] theologian and philosopher who served as [[Bishop of Paris]] from 1228 until his death. He was one of the first western European philosophers to engage with and comment extensively upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] philosophy.

He is also known as '''Guillaume d'Auvergne''',  '''Guilielmus Alvernus''', or '''William of Paris'''.

==Life==
Very little is known of William's early life. He was born in [[Aurillac]] and the likely date range for his birth is reckoned from the fact that a professor of Theology normally needed to be at least 35 years old. If that holds good, then William could have been born as early as 1180 or as late as 1190.

He went to Paris to study and earned a master's degree in [[Theology]] at the [[University of Paris]]. A [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosopher]], he was made a professor first in the faculty of arts and then in 1220 in that of theology. His theology was systematically Aristotelian, although not uncritically so, and he was the first theologian to attempt to reconcile [[Aristotle]] with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[doctrine]], and especially with the teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophos.com/philosophical_connections/profile_042.html Philosophical Connections, William of Auvergne] accessed on 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian texts which were then available in Western Europe were few in number and mostly [[Arabic language|Arab]] translations. William sought to rescue Aristotle from the [[Arabia]]ns and worked to refute certain doctrines, such as the [[Arguments for eternity|eternality]] of the world and the [[heresy]] of [[Catharism]]. His major work is the Magisterium Divinale, which has been translated as "Teaching on God in the Mode of Wisdom"&lt;ref&gt;William of Auvergne: On the Virtues, translated by Roland J Teske, Marquette Univ Press, 2009, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1223, William was a [[canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] [[cathedral]]. Upon the death of the bishop of Paris, [[Bartholomaeus]] (20 Oct 1227), the canons elected Nicolas as the next bishop. William was dissatisfied with this outcome and went to Rome to ask the Pope to intervene. Whilst in Rome he made such a strong impression on [[Pope Gregory IX]] that the pope chose William in 1228 to be the next bishop of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;William of Auvergne by Roland Teske, on [http://bartholomew.stanford.edu/authors/wmauvergne.html Bartholomew's World, William of Auvergne] accessed on 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[bishop of Paris]] William was a strong supporter of the university although his episcopacy was not without controversy in the eyes of the university. Following a heavy-handed use of royal force, which led to several students being killed in Paris, university staff turned to William expecting him to defend them. His failure to do so led to a [[University of Paris strike of 1229|university strike]] with many prominent masters and students leaving to go to other cities where they then founded new schools and universities. With the academic staff on strike William decided to appoint [[Roland of Cremona]] OP to a master's chair in theology, thus beginning a long and distinguished tradition in which Dominican and Franciscan masters taught at the university.

Whilst William was a strong advocate for the use of reason and academic study in theology, he also maintained that academic theology was at the service of the church and must conform to doctrinal requirements. As a result of this in January 1241 he published a list of 10 theological propositions which he condemned and ordered should not be taught at the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/uparis-cond1241.html Medieval Sourcebook, University of Paris condemnation of errors 1241] accessed on 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During his episcopate he also took action against [[prostitution]] in the city. In 1248, he served on the [[Regent|Regency]] council during [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]'s absence on the [[Seventh Crusade]].
