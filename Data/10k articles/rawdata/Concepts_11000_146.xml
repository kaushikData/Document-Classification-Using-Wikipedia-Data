'''AS Long As Possible (ASLAP)''' (2015-2017) is a visual art work by [[Finland|Finnish]] artist Juha van Ingen, consisting of a 1000-year long [[GIF]] animation loop.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/finnish-artists-create-1000-year-long-gif-titled-as-long-as-possible/|title=Finnish Artists Create 1000-year-long GIF Titled As Long As Possible|date=September 26, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at Kiasma National Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki on 28 March 2017. The animation is created in collaboration with developer and sound artist Janne Särkelä.&lt;ref name=KUMU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kumu.ekm.ee/en/syndmus/conductors-of-colour-music-modesty-and-modernity/|title=Conductors of Colour. Music, Modesty and Modernity|publisher=Art Museum of Estonia|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
ASLAP belongs to a group of art works where extreme duration is an essential part of the concept, like for instance Canadian artist [[Rodney Graham]]'s [[Parsifal]] (1882—38,969,364,735) based on a musical score by [[Richard Wagner]]'s assistant [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], a work that was initiated in 1990 and in theory is playing for another 39 billion years – three times longer than the estimated age of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="ARS17"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hello world! Art After the Internet|publisher=Helsinki: Kansalisgalleria - Finnish National Gallery, A Museum of Contemporary Art Publication| date=2017|url=https://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9977137134303681|pages=96-99|isbn=9527067421|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other well known examples are [[Longplayer]] by [[Jem Finer]] (of [[the Pogues]]) sounding from the [[Trinity Buoy Wharf|Trinity Buoy]] lighthouse near [[Canary Wharf]] in [[London]] and the yet to be realised 10,000-year [[Clock of the Long Now]] by the [[Long Now Foundation]] in USA.&lt;ref name="ARS17"/&gt;

==AS Long As Possible (ASLAP)==
The work is developed as a [[GIF]] animation, with each frame lasting 655090 milliseconds, which is approximately 10,5 minutes. The total number of frames is 48 140 288&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop |first=Rollin |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/web/a17442/1000-year-gif/ |title=There Is Now a GIF Will Take 1,000 Years to Loop Once |publisher=Popularmechanics.com |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the duration of the animation 1000 years.&lt;ref name=Kiasma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsguide.kiasma.fi/en/artwork/aslap-as-long-as-possible/|title=Juha van Ingen: ASLAP (AS Long As Possible)|publisher=Kiasma|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GIF file contains a loop function which will automatically, after the last frame has played, start the animation all over. ASLAP is intended to continue to play for ever.&lt;ref name=Voon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/237627/the-1000-year-gif/|title=The 1,000-Year GIF|publisher=Hyperallergic Media Inc.|last=Voon|first=Claire|date=September 21, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animation was developed in 2015, and premiered at [[Kiasma]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 2017, coinciding with the 30 year anniversary of the [[GIF]] format.&lt;ref name=KUMU/&gt; ASLAP was presented in the context of ARS 17: [["Hello, World!" program|”Hello World”]], a major exhibition of international [[contemporary art]] on the theme of [[postinternet]] art.&lt;ref name="ARS17"/&gt;

The name of ASLAP is homage to the musical composition [[As Slow as Possible|ORGAN²/ASLSP]] (1987) by [[John Cage]] which is currently played on the church organ of St. Burchardi church in [[Halberstadt]] in [[Germany]] since its premiere in 2001, and will continue to play for the next 639 years. The abbreviation of Cage's composition includes an instruction to the performer of the piece on how to perform the work: As SLow aS Possible.&lt;ref name=ASLAP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aslongaspossible.com|title=As Long As Possible|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintenance of the artwork ==
The ASLAP file is cloned and it will simultaneously run on six physical playback units at different geographical locations.&lt;ref name=Next&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/04/12/finnish-museum-commits-to-playing-a-1000-year-long-gif-to-the-bitter-end/#.tnw_X5nlXWIs|title=Finnish Museum Commits to Playing a 1,000 Year Long GIF to the Bitter End |last=MAACK|first=MÁR MÁSSON |date=April 12, 2017|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one unit is destroyed for any reason, or when it needs to be technically upgraded, a new physical unit is built and the animation file is cloned and synchronised with the remaining units. If all of the playback units are destroyed the file is to be reconstructed from special [[time capsules]] that contain the description of the artwork, the specifications of the GIF format, the original GIF file and necessary documents including a printed copy of the code for generating a new file.&lt;ref name=Next/&gt;

The first ASLAP play back unit is included in the collection of The [[Finnish National Gallery]] and is playing and stored in [[Helsinki]]. The Finnish National Gallery has agreed to keep the animation playing until 3017.&lt;ref name=Next/&gt; 

The first time capsule was deposited 18 March 2017 into the [[Kumu (museum)|Kumu]] [[Art Museum of Estonia]] collection and is permanently stored in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name=ASLAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Next/&gt;

== Presentation of ASLAP in ARS17==
Apart from the projected image of the ASLAP animation, the art work as presented by [[Kiasma]] included a player programmed by Jani Lindqvist, a computer, and a stainless steel box to protect the file and equipment through its life time. The installation also contained three digital prints of ASLAP frames and the printed binary code of the ASLAP GIF-file, frames 1 - 40100.&lt;ref name=ASLAP/&gt;

The '''astronomical system of units''', formally called the '''IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants''',{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--the reference does not say that the IAU system is a formal name of the common name "astronomical system of units"--&gt; is a [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement]] developed for use in [[astronomy]]. It was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1976,&lt;ref name="IAU76"&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been significantly updated in 1994 and 2009 (see [[astronomical constant]]).

The system was developed because of the difficulties in measuring and expressing astronomical data in [[International System of Units]] ([[SI unit]]s). In particular, there is a huge quantity of very precise data relating to the positions of objects within the [[Solar System]] which cannot conveniently be expressed or processed in SI units. Through a number of modifications, the astronomical system of units now explicitly recognizes the consequences of [[general relativity]], which is a necessary addition to the [[International System of Units]] in order to accurately treat astronomical data.

The astronomical system of units is a [[Dimensional analysis|tridimensional]] system, in that it defines units of [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]]. The associated [[astronomical constant]]s also fix the different [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] that are needed to report observations.&lt;ref name=Systems&gt;

In particular, there is the ''barycentric celestial reference system'' (BCRS) centered at the [[barycenter]] of the Solar System, and the ''geocentric celestial reference system'' (GCRS) centered at the center of mass of the Earth (including its fluid envelopes) {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NdrK4e77CIC&amp;pg=PA105 |author=Dennis D. McCarthy, P. Kenneth Seidelmann |title=	Time: from Earth rotation to atomic physics|chapter=Resolution B1.3: Definition of the barycentric celestial reference system and geocentric celestial reference system  ''XXIVth International Astronomical Union General Assembly (2000)'' |page=105 |isbn=3-527-40780-4 |date=2009 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The system is a conventional system, in that neither the unit of length nor the unit of mass are true [[physical constant]]s, and there are at least three different measures of time.

== Astronomical unit of time ==
{{Main|Day}}
The astronomical unit of time is the [[Day]], defined as {{val|86400}} [[second]]s. 365.25 days make up one [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]].&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The symbol ''D'' is used in astronomy to refer to this unit.

== Astronomical unit of mass ==
{{Main|Solar mass}}
The astronomical unit of mass is the [[solar mass]].&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The symbol {{Solar mass}} is often used to refer to this unit.
The solar mass ({{Solar mass}}), {{val|1.98892|e=30|ul=kg}}, is a standard way to express [[mass]] in [[astronomy]], used to describe the masses of other [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].  It is equal to the mass of the [[Sun]], about {{val|333000}} times the mass of the [[Earth]] or 1 048 times the mass of [[Jupiter]].

In practice, the masses of celestial bodies appear in the dynamics of the Solar System only through the products ''GM'', where ''G'' is the constant of gravitation. In the past, ''GM'' of the Sun could be determined experimentally with only limited accuracy. Its present accepted value is&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|''G'' {{Solar mass}}&lt;nowiki&gt;=1.327 124 420 99&lt;/nowiki&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;±10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}

===Jupiter mass===

{{main|Jupiter mass}}
Jupiter mass ({{Jupiter mass}} or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;JUP&lt;/sub&gt;), is the unit of [[mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]], {{val|1.898|e=27|ul=kg}}. Jupiter mass is used to describe masses of the [[gas giant]]s, such as the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It is also used in describing [[brown dwarfs]] and Neptune-mass planets.

===Earth mass===

{{Main|Earth mass}}
Earth mass ({{Earth mass}}) is the unit of [[mass]] equal to that of the [[Earth]]. 1 {{Earth mass}} = {{val|5.9742|e=24|ul=kg}}. Earth mass is often used to describe masses of rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s. It is also used to describe Neptune-mass planets. One Earth mass is {{val|0.00315}} times a Jupiter mass.

==Astronomical unit of length==
{{Main|Astronomical unit}}
The astronomical unit of length is now defined as exactly 149 597 870 700 meters.&lt;ref name="IAUresB2"&gt;{{citation |contribution=RESOLUTION B2 on the re-definition of the astronomical unit of length |title=RESOLUTION B2 | editor-last = International Astronomical Union |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |place=Beijing, China |date=31 August 2012 | contribution-url = http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2012_English.pdf |quote=The XXVIII General Assembly of International Astronomical Union … recommends … 1. that the astronomical unit be re-defined to be a conventional unit of length equal to 149 597 870 700 m exactly}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately equal to the mean Earth–Sun distance. It was formerly defined as that length for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The dimensions of ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are those of the [[constant of gravitation]] (''G''), i.e., L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The term “unit distance” is also used for the length ''A'' while, in general usage, it is usually referred to simply as the “astronomical unit”, symbol au.

An equivalent formulation of the old definition of the astronomical unit is the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of {{val|0.01720209895}} radians per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[speed of light]] in IAU is the defined value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|299792458|u=m/s}} of the SI units. In terms of this speed, the old definition of the astronomical unit of length had the  accepted value:&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;ua&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|1.49597870700|e=11}}&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m, where τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the transit time of light across the astronomical unit. The astronomical unit of length was determined by the condition that the measured data in the [[ephemeris]] match observations, and that in turn decides the transit time τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Other units for astronomical distances ===

{|class="wikitable"
!Astronomical Range
!Typical Units
|-
|Distances to [[satellites]]
|[[kilometre]]s
|-
|Distances to [[near-Earth object]]s
|[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]
|-
|[[Planet]]ary distances
|[[astronomical unit]]s, [[gigametre]]s

|[[parsec]]s, [[light-year]]s
|-
|Distances at the galactic scale
|[[kiloparsec]]s 
|-
|Distances to nearby [[galaxy|galaxies]]
|[[megaparsec]]s 
|}

The distances to distant galaxies are typically not quoted in distance units at all, but rather in terms of [[redshift]].  The reasons for this are that converting redshift to distance requires knowledge of the [[Hubble constant]] which was not accurately measured until the early 21st century, and that at cosmological distances, the curvature of [[space-time]] allows one to come up with multiple definitions for distance.  For example, the distance as defined by the amount of time it takes for a light beam to travel to an observer is different from the distance as defined by the apparent size of an object.

'''Burrhus Frederic Skinner''' (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as '''B. F.

Skinner considered [[free will]] an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the probability of the action being repeated becomes stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., and Gilbert Daniel. (2011). Psychology. (2 ed.). New York, 2011. Web. March 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|origyear=2009|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To strengthen behavior, Skinner used [[operant conditioning]], and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning, he invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], also known as the Skinner Box,&lt;ref&gt;Schacter D, L., Gilbert D, T., &amp; Wegner D, M. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure rate he invented the ''cumulative recorder''. Using these tools, he and [[C. B. Ferster]] produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in their book ''Schedules of Reinforcement'' (1957).&lt;ref name="BO"&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1938) ''The Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;C. B. Ferster &amp; B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner developed [[Applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]], the philosophy of that science he called [[radical behaviorism]],&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;B. F. Skinner, ''About Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the [[experimental analysis of behavior]].  He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel, ''[[Walden Two]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work, ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1958) Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Skinner was a prolific author who published 21&amp;nbsp;books and 180&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~allanr/biblio.html Lafayette.edu], accessed on 5-20-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf BFSkinner.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414011557/http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf |date=April 14, 2008 }}, Smith Morris Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism, along with [[John B.

== Biography ==
[[File:BF Skinner Grave.JPG|thumb|The gravestone of B.F. Skinner and his wife Eve at Mount Auburn Cemetery]]

Skinner was born in [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]], to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an [[atheism|atheist]] after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his grandmother described.&lt;ref&gt;"Within a year I had gone to Miss Graves to tell her that I no longer believed in God. 'I know,' she said, 'I have been through that myself.' But her strategy misfired: I never went through it." B.F. Skinner, pp. 387-413, E.G. Boring and G. Lindzey's ''A History of Psychology in Autobiography'' (Vol. 5), New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

Skinner's closest friend as a young boy was Raphael Miller, whom he called Doc because his father was a doctor.  Doc and Skinner became friends due to their parents’ religiousness and both had an interest in contraptions and gadgets.  They had set up a telegraph line between their houses to send messages to each other, although they had to call each other on the telephone due to the confusing messages sent back and forth.  During one summer, Doc and Skinner started an elderberry business to gather berries and sell them door to door.  They had found out that when they picked the ripe berries, the unripe ones came off the branches too, so they built a device that was able to separate them.  The device was a bent piece of metal to form a trough. They would pour water down the trough into a bucket, and the ripe berries would sink into the bucket and the unripe ones would be pushed over the edge to be thrown away.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"&gt;Skinner, B. (1976). Particulars of my life (1st ed.). New York, NY: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013"&gt;''B.F. Skinner: A Life'' [Paperback]. by Daniel W. Bjork, {{ISBN|9781557984166}}: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending, he joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. Hamilton was known for being a strong fraternity college.  Skinner had thought that his fraternity brothers were respectful and did not haze or mistreat the newcomers, instead, they helped out the other boys with courses or other activities.  Freshmen were called “‘slimers’” who had to wear small green knit hats and greet everyone that they passed for punishment.  The year before Skinner entered Hamilton, there was a hazing accident that caused the death of a student.  The freshman was asleep in his bed when he was pushed onto the floor, where he smashed his head, resulting in his death.  Skinner had a similar incident where two freshmen captured him and tied him to a pole, where he should have stayed all night, but he had a razor blade in his shoe for emergency and managed to cut himself free.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"/&gt; He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the traditional mores of his college. After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an [[experimental science]] from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the [[Skinner Box]] and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet [[Robert Frost]], concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with [[John B. Watson]]'s ''Behaviorism'' led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=B. F. Skinner: a Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] at Minneapolis and later at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973, Skinner was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne (Eve) Blue. The couple had two daughters, [[Julie Vargas|Julie]] (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. [[Barry Buzan|Buzan]]).&lt;ref name="Deborah Skinner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsesbyskinner.com/?page_id=12|title=About|last=Skinner|first=Deborah|work=Horses by Skinner|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|title=I was not a lab rat|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|date=March 12, 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Skinner died in 1997,&lt;ref name="Papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Yvonne, 1911-1997.

(1993). B.F. Skinner, A Life. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner's public exposure had increased in the 1970s, he remained active even after his retirement in 1974, until his death.  In 1989, Skinner was diagnosed with leukemia and died on August 18, 1990 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Ten days before his death, he was given the lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and gave a talk in an auditorium concerning his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Famous People. (2017). B. F. Skinner biography&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.

== Contributions to psychological theory ==

===Behaviorism===
{{Main|Behaviorism|Radical behaviorism}}
Skinner called his approach to the study of behavior [[radical behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behavior'' § 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 {{ISBN|0-394-71618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see [[Applied behavior analysis]]). In contrast to the approach of [[cognitive science]], behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other "private events" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.
&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
In this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. pp. 18−20 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theoretical structure===
Skinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, ''Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=B.F.|title=Behavior of Organisms|date=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways.  ''Respondent'' behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called "Pavlovian conditioning" or "[[classical conditioning]]", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. ''Operant'' behaviors, in contrast, are "emitted", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called "instrumental conditioning", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlov|first1=I. P.|title=Conditioned Reflexes|date=1927|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operants by Thorndike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=E. L.|title=Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies|date=1911|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H.M. "Animal Learning and Behavior", Ch. 5, in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology" (1979) Erlbaum: Hillsdale, N. J.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.

The idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions.  Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place?  (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled?  (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=great questions, but were they raised by Skinner, and, if so, a source/reference should be given. If not, were they simply put here by a WP editor?}}

====Origin of operant behavior====
Skinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. "Shaping" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that "superstitious" behavior can arise when a response{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=not really needing "clarification" but is the best word here?}} happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.

====Control of operant behavior====
The second question, "how is operant behavior controlled?" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is "emitted" without reference to any particular stimulus.  Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not.  For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [[three-term contingency]] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

====Explaining complex behavior====
Most behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of "chaining."  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer." For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food." Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

However, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1966) Contingencies of Reinforcement, New York; Appleton-Century-Crofts. reprinted 2013, B. F. Skinner Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to "jump", "open the book", and so on.  After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"/&gt;

===Reinforcement===
{{Main|Reinforcement}}
Reinforcement, a key concept of [[behaviorism]], is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, "positive" and "negative."  In ''The Behavior of Organisms'' (1938), Skinner defined "negative reinforcement" to be synonymous with [[punishment]], that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in ''Science and Human Behavior'' (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied ([[positive reinforcement]]) or something removed or avoided ([[negative reinforcement]]). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus ([[negative punishment]] or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. Science and Human Behavior (1953) New York: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.

Writing in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, "selection by consequences." Though, as he said, natural selection has now "made its case", he regretted that essentially the same process, "reinforcement", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=July 31, 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==== Schedules of reinforcement ====
{{Main|Schedules of reinforcement}}
Skinner recognized that behavior is typically reinforced more than once, and, together with C. B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called "[[schedules of reinforcement]]."&lt;ref name="Schedules"&gt;Ferster, C. B. and Skinner, B. F.  Schedules of Reinforcement.  New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in [[operant conditioning]].

* '''Continuous reinforcement (CRF)''' — each time a specific action is performed the subject receives a reinforcement. This method is effective when teaching a new behavior because it quickly establishes an association between the target behavior and the reinforcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Reinforcement Scedules|url=http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/Reinforcement-Table1.pdf|website=autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu|publisher=National Professional Development Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interval Schedules''' — based on the time intervals between reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"&gt;Psychology 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Fixed Interval Schedule (FI)''': A procedure in which reinforcements are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response is made. This schedule yields a response rate that is low just after reinforcement and becomes rapid just before the next reinforcement is scheduled.
**'''Variable Interval Schedule (VI)''': A procedure in which behavior is reinforced after random time durations following the last reinforcement. This schedule yields steady responding at a rate that varies with the average frequency of reinforcement.
*'''Ratio Schedules''' — based on the ratio of responses to reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"/&gt;
**'''Fixed Ratio Schedule (FR)''':  A procedure in which reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made.
**'''Variable Ratio Schedule (VR)''': A procedure in which reinforcement comes after a number of responses that is randomized from one reinforcement to the next (ex. slot machines). The lower the number of responses required, the higher the response rate tends to be. Ratio schedules tend to produce very rapid responding, often with breaks of no responding just after reinforcement if a large number of responses is required for reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner. (2011). Schedules of Reinforcement. Psychology second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific inventions==

=== Operant conditioning chamber ===
{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
An [[operant conditioning chamber]] (also known as a ''Skinner Box'') is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior.  It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]]. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this "manipulandum" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

=== Cumulative recorder ===

The cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the [[Operant chamber]] as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck.  In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder.  Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}}  Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, ''Schedules of Reinforcement'', is full of cumulative records produced by this device.&lt;ref name="Schedules"/&gt;

Skinner invented the device to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while allowing the baby to be more mobile and comfortable, and less prone to cry. Reportedly it had some success in these goals.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

The air crib was a controversial invention. It was popularly mischaracterized as a cruel pen, and it was often compared to Skinner's [[operant conditioning chamber]], commonly called the "Skinner Box." This association with laboratory animal experimentation discouraged its commercial success, though several companies attempted production.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp "One Man and a Baby Box"], accessed on 12-29-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burrhus Fredrick Skinner|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Skinner, Burrhus Frederic (1904 - 1990)|publisher=Gale, Credo Reference|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 book by [[Lauren Slater]], entitled ''[[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century]]''&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;Slater, L. (2004) [[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century|Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century]], London, Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt; caused a stir by mentioning the rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, in some of his experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book stated that the rumors were false, a reviewer in ''[[The Observer]]'' in March 2004 misquoted Slater's book as supporting the rumors. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who wrote a vehement riposte in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|title=I was not a lab rat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching machine ===
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|The teaching machine, a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed learning]]]]

The [[teaching machine]] was a [[mechanical device]] whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of [[programmed learning]]. The machine embodies key elements of Skinner's theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=Why we need teaching machines|journal=Harvard Educational Review|year=1961|volume=31|pages=377–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/1950.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. "Unison" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.F. | year = 1961 | title = Teaching machines | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 90–112 | doi = 10.2307/1926170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, "learning by doing."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. and Holland, J. "The Analysis of Behavior: A Program for Self Instruction", 1961, p.387&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.

Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.

Skinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philmcrae.com/2/post/2013/04/rebirth-of-the-teaching-maching-through-the-seduction-of-data-analytics-this-time-its-personal1.html|title=Rebirth of the Teaching Machine through the Seduction of Data Analytics: This Time It's Personal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pigeon-guided missile ===
{{Main|Project Pigeon}}
During World War II, the [[US Navy]] required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' class]] battleships. Although [[missile]] and [[Television guidance|TV]] technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated [[Project Pigeon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.

New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353|title=Nose Cone, Pigeon-Guided Missile|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516215806/http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353| archivedate= May 16, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an effective demonstration, the project was abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available. Skinner complained that "our problem was no one would take us seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skinner's Utopia: Panacea, or Path to Hell?|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=September 20, 1971|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909994-5,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed that few people would trust pigeons to guide a missile, no matter how reliable the system appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Richard Dawkins]]|title=Design for a Faith-Based Missile|journal=Free Inquiry magazine|volume= 22|issue= 1|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_22_1.html}} The project was also featured by {{cite news

=== Verbal summator ===

Early in his career Skinner became interested in "latent speech" and experimented with a device he called the "verbal summator."&lt;ref name="doi_9917445"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B. F. |year=1936 |title=The Verbal Summator and a Method for the Study of Latent Speech |journal=[[Journal of Psychology]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=71–107 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1936.9917445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This device can be thought of as an auditory version  of the Rorschach inkblots.&lt;ref name="doi_9917445" /&gt; When using the device, human participants listened to incomprehensible auditory "garbage" but often read meaning into what they heard. Thus, as with the Rorschach blots, the device was intended to yield overt behavior that projected subconscious thoughts.  Skinner's interest in projective testing was brief, but he later used observations with the summator in creating his theory of verbal behavior.  The device also led other researchers to invent new tests such as the tautophone test, the auditory apperception test, and the Azzageddi{{Definition|date=May 2016}} test.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, A., B.

== ''Verbal Behavior'' ==
{{Main|Verbal Behavior (book)}}
Challenged by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior,&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Verbal Behavior''. The account in the appendix is that he asked Skinner to explain why he said "No black scorpion, Carter is falling upon this table."&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Burrhus Frederick(1904 - 1990).|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Credo Reference, Gale|publisher=Credo Reference, Gale|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of ''Verbal Behavior'', he conceded that Skinner's "S-R psychology" was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the "S-R" characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).&lt;ref name="RVB"&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1957) "A Review of BF Skinner's Verbal Behavior." [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm in the preface, 2nd paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Verbal Behavior'' had an uncharacteristically cool reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Richelle, M. (1993). ''B. F. Skinner: A reappraisal''. Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's peers may have been slow to adopt the ideas presented in ''Verbal Behavior'' because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1984.42-363 | last1 = Michael | first1 = J. | year = 1984 | title = Verbal behavior | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 363–376 | pmid = 16812395 | pmc = 1348108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on education ==
{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}
&lt;!--Good idea to have this section, but it needs to be written in an encyclopedic style, with references--&gt;
&lt;!--A possible source might be The Technology of Teaching, as well as Keller's PSM and so on and so on--&gt;
Skinner's views influenced [[education]] as well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" can be an effective reinforcer &lt;!-- What is this a citation from? --&gt;. Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;389).

Skinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, J. (1992). B.F Skinner. Pittsburgh: American Psychologist&lt;/ref&gt;

Because teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In ''The Technology of Teaching'', Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]]. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:
:* using aversive techniques (which produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects);
:* relying on telling and explaining ("Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told." p.&amp;nbsp;103);
:* failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level;
:* failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are
#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn.
#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.
#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions.
#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached.
#Shift to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance.
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. They are also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley]]'s ''[[Precision teaching|Precision Teaching]]''.

== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==
Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]],'' (for which he made the cover of ''[[TIME]]'' Magazine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B.F. Skinner Sep. 20, 1971 |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19710920,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former describes a fictional "experimental community"&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1968). "The Design of Experimental Communities", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.

''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI. Attempts to analyze ''Walden Two'', ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', and other Skinner works in the context of Skinner's life; lists over 500 sources.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Kat Kinkade]] and others founded the [[Twin Oaks Community]], using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living Walden Two: B. F. Skinner's Behaviorist Utopia and Experimental Communities|author=Hilke Kuhlman|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date= Oct 1, 2010|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

== Political views ==
Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.&lt;ref&gt;see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example&lt;/ref&gt; He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of control, citing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of literature that "did not fear the power of positive reinforcement."&lt;ref name="W2"/&gt;

Skinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 30, 1996 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&amp;hw=spanking+debate&amp;sn=009&amp;sc=334 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Skinner's [[utopia]] is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In ''Walden Two'', Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – "What is the Good Life?" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption.

== Superstition in the pigeon ==
One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon "at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior." He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.&lt;ref name=superstition&gt;Skinner, B. F. "'Superstition' in the Pigeon", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Skinner (1948)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their "rituals", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing—or, more strictly speaking, did something else.&lt;ref name=superstition /&gt;}}

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's "superstition" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's "adventitious reinforcement" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their "autoshaping" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The basis of superstitious behavior: chance contingency, stimulus substitution, or appetitive behavior?|first1=W|last1=Timberlake|first2=G A|last2=Lucas|date=November 1, 1985|publisher=|journal=J Exp Anal Behav|volume=44|issue=3|pages=279–299|doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.44-279|pmid=4086972|pmc=1348192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== J. E. R. Staddon ===
As understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say "Skinner is brilliant" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition'', 2014) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]]; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. (1995) On responsibility and punishment. ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88−94. Staddon, J. (1999) On responsibility in science and law. ''Social Philosophy and Policy'', 16, 146-174. Reprinted in ''Responsibility''. E. F. Paul, F. D. Miller, &amp; J. Paul (eds.), 1999. Cambridge University Press, pp. 146−174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noam Chomsky ===
[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent critic of Skinner, published a [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|review]] of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'' two years after it was published.&lt;ref name="Chomsky review"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|year=1959|title=Reviews: ''Verbal behavior'' by B.

Conditioned responses could not account for a child's ability to create or understand an infinite variety of novel sentences. Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology and other disciplines&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;see Chomsky page for citation&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]]'s reply was endorsed by Skinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacCorquodale|first=Kenneth|date=1970-01-01|title=ON CHOMSKY'S REVIEW OF SKINNER'S VERBAL BEHAVIOR|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83/abstract|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=83–99|doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83|issn=1938-3711|pmc=1333660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', using the same basic motives as his ''Verbal Behavior'' review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1972) "The Case Against B. F. Skinner."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychodynamic psychology ===
Skinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards [[Sigmund Freud]], [[psychoanalysis]], and [[psychodynamic psychology]]. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of [[defense mechanisms]], such as [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toates |first=F. |year=2009 |title=Burrhus F.

'''Cartoon violence''' is the representation of [[Violence|violent actions]] involving [[animation|animated]] characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted.

==Debates==
People have different views about cartoons and the violence within them. Some researchers believe that high level of [[violence in cartoons]] can make children more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1159766/Cartoon-violence-makes-children-aggressive.html |title=Cartoon violence 'makes children more aggressive' |last=Clark |first=Laura |publisher=Associated Newspapers |location=London |date=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at children as young as seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence.

Some researches on the other hand believe that people need to consider the ways in which children process information, the amount of mental effort they invest, and their own life experience to gain an understanding of how television violence affects children. For instance recent research has indicated that children do not appear to mimic acts of violence in the media, whether television or cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Ferguson, (2010) "[http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf Video Games and Youth Violence: A Prospective Analysis in Adolescents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525061300/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf |date=May 25, 2012 }}", ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence''&lt;/ref&gt;
Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as "make believe" to children and will not be applied into their real lives.&lt;ref name=Blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz|title=Does Cartoon Violence Beget Aggressive Behavior in Real Life? An Opposing View|doi=10.1007/s10643-008-0280-1|journal=Early Childhood Educ J|date=26 August 2008|pages=102|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|subscription =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Options for Parents and Restriction==
There are a number of ways parents can control their children’s exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the amount and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect [[Television violence|TV violence]] has on their outlook and behaviors.

Three initiatives have been put in place to combat violence in cartoons (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cartoon Violence: Is it as Detrimental to Preschoolers as we Think?|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2002-03-01|first=Kristen|last=Peters|author2=Fran Blumberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=143–149|id= |url=|type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The first is The [[Children's Television Act]] which requires [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]]s to air shows which are [[education]]al and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the [[V-chip]] [[legislation]] that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association’s [[TV Parental Guidelines]], which is a system that rates the [[Television show]]s based on their contents

In [[Action (fiction)|action]]-[[Adventure (genre)|adventure]] oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of [[fantasy violence]] in which no one is injured or killed onscreen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be [[robot]]s so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, [[tank]]s, [[aircraft]], and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the [[aviatior|pilot]] to escape or bail out. Realistic [[firearm]]s are often replaced with futuristic [[beam weapon]]s which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other [[bladed weapon]]s may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Direct violence is frequently limited to [[hand to hand combat]] where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as "sanitized violence". Cartoons based on the [[Voltron]], [[Transformers]], [[G.I. Joe]], and [[Masters of the Universe]] franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.

Additionally, parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content.&lt;ref name=Strasburger&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strasburger, V. |author2=Jordan, A. |author3=Donnerstein |last-author-amp=yes |title=Health Effects of Media on Children and Adolescents|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom.&lt;ref name=Strasburger/&gt;

==Effects==
{{Main|Media violence research}}
Effects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial.  Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kirsh, (2006) "[Cartoon violence and aggression in youth]", ''Aggression and Violent Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it.&lt;ref name=Blumberg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21816">The '''Cauchy momentum equation''' is a vector [[partial differential equation]] put forth by [[Cauchy]] that describes the non-relativistic momentum transport in any [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]].&lt;ref name=Acheson&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Acheson
  | first = D. J.

  | year = 1990
  |page = 205
  | isbn = 0-19-859679-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In convective (or Lagrangian) form it is written: 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] at the point considered in the continuum (for which the [[continuity equation]] holds), {{math|'''σ'''}} is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]], and {{math|'''g'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit mass (often simply [[gravitational acceleration]]). {{math|'''u'''}} is the [[flow velocity]] vector field, which depends on time and space.

After an appropriate change of variables, it can also be written in conservation  (or Eulerian) form:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial  \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F  = \mathbf s &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[mass flux|momentum density]] at a given space-time point, {{math|'''F'''}} is the flux associated to the momentum density, and {{math|'''s'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit volume.

==Derivation==
Applying [[Newton's second law]] ({{mvar|i}}th component) to a [[control volume]] in the continuum being modeled gives:

:&lt;math&gt;m a_i = F_i&lt;/math&gt;

and basing on the [[Reynolds transport theorem]] and on the [[material derivative]] notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega} \rho \frac{D u_i}{D t} \, dV &amp;= \int_{\Omega} \nabla_j\sigma_i^j \, dV + \int_{\Omega} \rho g_i \, dV \\
\int_{\Omega} \left(\rho \frac{D u_i}{D t} - \nabla_j\sigma_i^j - \rho g_i \right)\, dV &amp;= 0 \\
\rho \frac{D u_i}{D t}- \nabla_j\sigma_i^j - \rho g_i &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{D u_i}{D t}- \frac {\nabla_j\sigma_i^j}{\rho} - g_i &amp;= 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Ω}} represents the control volume. Since this equation must hold for any control volume, it must be true that the integrand is zero, from this the Cauchy momentum equation follows. The main step (not done above) in deriving this equation is establishing that the [[tensor derivative|derivative]] of the stress tensor is one of the forces that constitutes {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Acheson /&gt;

==Conservation form==
{{see also|conservation law (physics)}}
Cauchy equations can also be put in the following form:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial \mathbf j}{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F  = \mathbf s
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

simply by defining:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} {\mathbf j}&amp;= \rho \mathbf u \\
{\mathbf F}&amp;=\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u - \boldsymbol \sigma \\
{\mathbf s}&amp;= \rho \mathbf g
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[mass flux|momentum density]] at the point considered in the continuum (for which the [[continuity equation]] holds), {{math|'''F'''}} is the flux associated to the momentum density, and {{math|'''s'''}} contains all of the [[body force]]s per unit volume. {{math|'''u''' ⊗ '''u'''}} is the [[Dyadic product|dyad]] of the velocity.

Here {{math|'''j'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} have same number of dimensions {{mvar|N}} as the flow speed and the body acceleration, while {{math|'''F'''}}, being a [[tensor]], has {{math|''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In 3D for example, with respect to some coordinate system, the vector {{math|'''j'''}} has 3 components, while the tensors {{math|'''σ'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}} have 9 (3x3), so the explicit forms written as matrices would be:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathbf j}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}  \rho u_1 \\ \rho u_2  \\ \rho u_3 \end{pmatrix} \\
{\mathbf s}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}  \rho g_1 \\ \rho g_2  \\ \rho g_3 \end{pmatrix} \\
{\mathbf F}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}
\rho u_1^2 + \sigma_{11} &amp;  \rho u_1u_2 + \sigma_{12}&amp; \rho u_1u_3 + \sigma_{13}
\\  \rho u_2 u_1 + \sigma_{12}&amp; \rho u_2^2 + \sigma_{22} &amp; \rho u_2u_3 +\sigma_{23}
\\ \rho u_3 u_1 + \sigma_{13}&amp;  \rho u_3 u_2 +\sigma_{23}&amp;  \rho u_3^2 + \sigma_{33}
\end{pmatrix}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that if symmetrical, {{math|'''F'''}} will only contain 6 ''[[degrees of freedom]]''.  And {{math|'''F'''}}'s symmetry is equivalent to {{math|'''σ'''}}'s symmetry (which will be present for the most common [[Cauchy stress tensor|Cauchy stress tensors]]), since dyads of vectors with themselves are always symmetrical.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eulerian forms it is apparent that the assumption of no deviatoric stress brings Cauchy equations to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

==Convective acceleration==
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convective acceleration. The flow is steady (time-independent), but the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow).]]

A significant feature of the Navier–Stokes equations is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of time-independent acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual continuum particles indeed experience time dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

Regardless of what kind of continuum is being dealt with, convective acceleration is a [[nonlinear]] effect. Convective acceleration is present in most flows (exceptions include one-dimensional incompressible flow), but its dynamic effect is disregarded in [[creeping flow]] (also called Stokes flow). Convective acceleration is represented by the [[nonlinear]] quantity {{math|'''u''' · ∇'''u'''}}, which may be interpreted either as {{math|('''u''' · ∇)'''u'''}} or as {{math|'''u''' · (∇'''u''')}}, with {{math|∇'''u'''}} the [[tensor derivative]] of the velocity vector {{math|'''u'''}}. Both interpretations give the same result.&lt;ref name=Emanuel&gt;{{cite book | last=Emanuel | first=G. | title=Analytical fluid dynamics | publisher=CRC Press | year=2001 | edition=second | isbn=0-8493-9114-8 | page=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advection operator vs tensor derivative ===

The convection term &lt;math&gt;D\mathbf{u}/Dt&lt;/math&gt; can be written as {{math|('''u''' · ∇)'''u'''}}, where {{math|'''u''' · ∇}} is the [[advection|advection operator]]. This representation can be contrasted to the one in terms of the tensor derivative.&lt;ref name=Emanuel/&gt; 
The tensor derivative {{math|∇'''u'''}} is the component-by-component derivative of the velocity vector, defined by {{math|[∇'''u''']&lt;sub&gt;''mi''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ∂''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\mathbf{u}\cdot\left(\nabla \mathbf{u}\right)\right]_i=\sum_m v_m \partial_m v_i=\left[(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\right]_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lamb form===
The [[vector calculus identity]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)#Identities|cross product of a curl]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{a} \right) =\nabla_a \left( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a } \right) - \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla  \mathbf{ a} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where the Feynman subscript notation {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor {{mvar|a}}.

[[Horace Lamb|Lamb]] in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://web2srv.ing.uniroma1.it/~m_valorani/GasTurbines_LM_files/DispenseTurboMacchine.pdf |last=Valorani |first=Nasuti |title=Metodi di analisi delle turbomacchine |page=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form, i.e. without a tensor derivative:&lt;ref&gt;See Batchelor (1967), §3.5, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld| id=ConvectiveDerivative| title = Convective Derivative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right)  + \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf l=\left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Lamb vector]]. The Cauchy momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \tfrac12 \nabla \left(u^2\right) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left( \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma}{\rho} \right) = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma  - \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho &lt;/math&gt;

the Cauchy equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left(\tfrac12 u^2 + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) - \mathbf g =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, in case of an external [[conservative field]], by defining its potential {{mvar|φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right)  =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot  \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) =  \frac{1}{\rho^2} \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a ''[[streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]'', the cross product disappears due to a vector calculus identity of the [[triple scalar product]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac {\boldsymbol \sigma} \rho \right) = \frac{1}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot (\boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \nabla \rho)  &lt;/math&gt;

If the stress tensor is isotropic, then only the pressure enters, and the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) = \frac{p}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho  &lt;/math&gt;

In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, ''the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant''. This leads to a considerable simplification of the Euler momentum equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The convenience of defining the [[total head]] for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent:

:&lt;math&gt; b_l \equiv \tfrac12 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in fact, the above equation can be simply written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_l = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant''.

===Irrotational flows===
The Lamb form is also useful in irrotational flow, where the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the velocity (called [[vorticity]]) {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ∇ × '''u'''}} is equal to zero. In that case, the convection term &lt;math&gt;D\mathbf{u}/Dt&lt;/math&gt; reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Stresses==&lt;!--Lift (force) has a wikilink to here--&gt;
The effect of stress in the continuum flow is represented by the {{math|∇''p''}} and {{math|∇ · '''τ'''}} terms; these are [[gradient]]s of surface forces, analogous to stresses in a solid. Here {{math|∇''p''}} is the pressure gradient and arises from the isotropic part of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. This part is given by the [[normal stress]]es that occur in almost all situations. The anisotropic part of the stress tensor gives rise to {{math|∇ · '''τ'''}}, which usually describes viscous forces; for incompressible flow, this is only a shear effect. Thus, {{math|'''τ'''}} is the [[deviatoric stress tensor]], and the stress tensor is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=September 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = - p \mathbf I + \boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''I'''}} is the [[identity matrix]] in the space considered  and {{math|'''τ'''}} the shear tensor.

All non-relativistic momentum conservation equations, such as the [[Navier–Stokes equation]], can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy momentum equation and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the shear tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]], and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy momentum equation will lead to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. By assuming [[inviscid flow]], the Navier–Stokes equations can further simplify to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

The divergence of the stress tensor can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

The effect of the pressure gradient on the flow is to accelerate the flow in the direction from high pressure to low pressure.

As written in the Cauchy momentum equation, the stress terms {{mvar|p}} and {{math|'''τ'''}} are yet unknown, so this equation alone cannot be used to solve problems. Besides the equations of motion—Newton's second law—a force model is needed relating the stresses to the flow motion.&lt;ref&gt;

==External forces==
The vector field {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force]]s per unit mass. Typically, these consist of only [[gravity]] acceleration, but may include others, such as electromagnetic forces. In non-inertial coordinate frames, other "inertial accelerations" associated with [[Fictitious force|rotating coordinates]] may arise.

Often, these forces may be represented as the gradient of some scalar quantity {{mvar|χ}}, with {{math|'''g''' {{=}} ∇''χ''}} in which case they are called [[conservative force]]s. Gravity in the {{mvar|z}} direction, for example, is the gradient of {{math|−''ρgz''}}. Because pressure from such gravitation arises only as a gradient, we may include it in the pressure term as a body force {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''p'' − ''χ''}}. The pressure and force terms on the right-hand side of the Navier–Stokes equation become

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla p + \mathbf{g} = -\nabla p + \nabla \chi = -\nabla \left( p - \chi \right) = -\nabla h.&lt;/math&gt;

==Nondimensionalisation==
In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a characteristic velocity {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho^* &amp;\equiv \frac \rho {\rho_0} &amp; u^* &amp;\equiv \frac u {u_0} &amp; r^* &amp;\equiv \frac r {r_0} &amp; t^*&amp;\equiv \frac {u_0}{r_0} t \\[6pt]
\nabla^* &amp;\equiv r_0 \nabla &amp; \mathbf g^* &amp;\equiv \frac {\mathbf g} {g_0} &amp; p^* &amp;\equiv \frac p {p_0} &amp; \boldsymbol \tau^* &amp;\equiv \frac {\boldsymbol \tau} {\tau_0}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of these inverted relations in the Euler momentum equations yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\rho_0 u_0^2}{r_0}\frac{\partial \rho^* \mathbf u^*}{\partial t^*}+ \frac {\nabla^*}{r_0} \cdot \left( \rho_0 u_0^2 \rho^* \mathbf u^* \otimes \mathbf u^* + p_0 p^* \right)= - \frac {\tau_0}{r_0} \nabla^* \cdot \boldsymbol \tau^* + g_0 \mathbf g^*&lt;/math&gt;

and by dividing for the first coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf \rho^* u^*}{\partial t^*}+  \nabla^* \cdot \left(\rho^* \mathbf u^* \otimes  \mathbf u^* + \frac {p_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2} p^* \right)= - \frac {\tau_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2} \nabla^* \cdot \boldsymbol \tau^* + \frac { g_0 r_0}{u_0^2} \mathbf g^*&lt;/math&gt;

Now defining the [[Froude number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}=\frac{u_0^2}{g_0 r_0},&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eu}=\frac{p_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[coefficient of friction|coefficient of skin-friction]] or the one usually referred as 'drag' co-efficient in the field of aerodynamics:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{f}=\frac{2 \tau_0}{\rho_0 u_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;

by passing respectively to the [[conservative variables]], i.e. the [[mass flux|momentum density]] and the [[force density]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf j &amp;= \rho \mathbf u \\ \mathbf f &amp;= \rho \mathbf g \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the equations are finally expressed (now omitting the indexes):
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional conservative form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \left(\frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + \mathrm{Eu} \, p \right) = - \frac {C_\mathrm{f}} 2  \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \mathbf f
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

Cauchy equations in the Froude limit {{math|Fr → ∞}} (corresponding to negligible external field) are named free Cauchy equations:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Free Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional conservative form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \mathbf j }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \left(\frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + \mathrm{Eu} \, p \right) = - \frac {C_\mathrm{f}} 2  \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

and can be eventually [[conservation law|conservation equations]]. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable for such equations and is studied with [[perturbation theory]].

Finally in convective form the equations are:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' (''nondimensional convective form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D \mathbf u }{ D t} + \mathrm{Eu} \, \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \sigma = \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \mathbf g 
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

{{refimprove|date=October 2008}}

A '''computational model''' is a [[mathematical model]] in [[computational science]] that requires extensive [[computational resource]]s to study the behavior of a [[complex system]] by [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Melnik |editor-first=Roderick |title=Mathematical and Computational Modeling: With Applications in Natural and Social Sciences, Engineering, and the Arts |publisher=Wiley |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-118-85398-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system under study is often a complex [[nonlinear system]] for which simple, intuitive [[analytical solution]]s are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by adjusting the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments.  Operation theories of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.

Examples of common computational models are [[weather forecasting]] models, [[earth simulator]] models, [[flight simulator]] models, molecular [[protein folding]] models, and [[neural network]] models.

A '''conceptual system''' is a system that is composed of non-[[physical system|physical]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, i.e. ideas or concepts. In this context a [[system]] is taken to mean "an interrelated, interworking set of objects".

== Overview ==
A conceptual system is a [[conceptual model]]. Such systems may be related to any topic from [[formal science]] to individual [[imagination]]. Conceptual systems may be found within the human mind, as works of art and fiction, and within the academic world. Indeed, this article may be understood as a conceptual system because it includes a set of interrelated concepts.

Broadly, when a conceptual system includes a range of values, ideas, and beliefs the conceptual system is said be a [[worldview|view of the world]]. In [[psychology]] and [[social work]], a conceptual system may refer to an individual's [[mental model]] of the world. In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a [[metaphor]] for the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0402_4 | volume=4 | title=The Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System | journal=Cognitive Science | pages=195–208 | last1 = Lakoff | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt; In science, there are many forms of conceptual systems including laws, theories, and models. Those conceptual systems may be developed through [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical analysis]].

The idea that the human mind might contain conceptual systems goes back at least as far as Kelly's [[personal construct theory]] in 1955. More recently, many scholars discuss conceptual systems and the importance of understanding them (c.f. [[Bateson]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], [[Senge]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Umberto Eco|Eco]], [[Umpleby]], and [http://projectfast.org Wallis]). On the personal level, the human mind is generally held to contain a wide range of conceptual systems although they are not well organized. Indeed, our minds are full of conflicting mental models&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/92-09-048.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which makes decision making unreliable - particularly in large-scale, complex situations.

Within the academic literature, each theory may be understood as a conceptual system. Conceptual systems are generally held to have greater value when they are more useful, based on more research, and are more systemically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integral-review.org/documents/Wallis,%20Validation%20of%20Theory,%20Vol.%204%20No.%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, that validity may also be described in terms of its internal [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and the [[Communication|correspondence]] between the conceptual system and other systems (e.g. [[social system]]s or [[physical system]]s). Coherence may be tested by [[Integrative complexity]] (for individuals) and  by [http://journals.isss.org/index.php/proceedings56th/article/viewFile/1943/657 Integrative Propositional Analysis] (for academic theories). Correspondence is generally tested by [[empirical analysis]] and conditions of [[falsifiability]]. The conceptual system may then be said to model the physical or social system and serve as a guide for individual behavior or academic research.

=== Concept ===
{{Main|Concept}}
A '''concept''' is an [[abstraction|abstract]] [[idea]] or a mental symbol, typically associated with a corresponding representation in [[language]] or [[symbology]], that denotes all of the objects in a given [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] or [[class (philosophy)|class]] of entities, [[interaction]]s, [[phenomena]], or relationships between them.  Concepts are abstract in that they omit the [[Difference (philosophy)|differences]] of the things in  [[extension (semantics)|extension]], treating them as if they were identical. They are universal in that they apply equally to everything in their extension.  Concepts are also the basic elements of [[proposition]]s, much the same way a [[word]] is the basic [[semantics|semantic]] element of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Unlike [[perception]]s, which are particular images of individual objects, concepts cannot be visualized. Because they are not, themselves, individual perceptions, concepts are discursive and result from [[reason]]. They can only be thought about, or designated, by means of a [[name]]. Words are not concepts. Words are signs for concepts.

=== Conceptual schema ===
{{Main|Conceptual schema}}
A conceptual model is a representation of some phenomenon, data or theory by logical and mathematical objects such as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, tables, [[stochastic process]]es, formulas, axiom systems, rules of inference etc. A conceptual model has an [[ontology]], that is the set of expressions in the model which are ''intended'' to denote some aspect of the modeled object. Here we are deliberately vague as to how expressions are constructed in a model and particularly what the logical structure of formulas in a model actually is.  In fact, we have made no assumption that models are encoded in any [[formal logical system]] at all, although we briefly address this issue below. Moreover, the definition given here is oblivious to whether two expressions really should denote the same thing. Note that this notion of ontology is different from (and weaker than) ontology as is sometimes understood in philosophy; in our sense there is no claim that the expressions actually denote anything which exists ''physically'' or ''spatio-temporally'' (to use W. Quine's formulation).

For example, a stochastic model of stock prices includes in its ontology a sample space, random variables, the mean and variance of stock prices, various regression coefficients etc. Models of [[quantum mechanics]] in which [[pure state]]s are represented as unit vectors in a Hilbert space include in their ontologies [[observable]]s, [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[measurement]] operators etc. It is possible that observables and states of quantum mechanics are as physically real as the electrons they model, but by adopting this purely formal notion of ontology we avoid altogether this question.

=== Conceptual framework ===
{{Main|Conceptual framework}}
A [[conceptual framework]] is used in research to outline possible courses of action or to present a preferred approach to a [[system analysis]] project. It has also been defined as the organization of ideas to achieve a purpose&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating conceptual frameworks and project Management.'' Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press&lt;/ref&gt; The framework is built from a set of [[concept]]s linked to a planned or existing [[system]] of [[Method (software engineering)|method]]s, [[behavior]]s, functions, relationships, and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s. A conceptual framework might, in computing terms, be thought of as a [[relational model]].

For example, a conceptual framework of accounting "seeks to identify the nature, subject, purpose and broad content of general-purpose financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics that financial information should possess".&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, J.C. ''Australian Financial Accounting'', McGraw Hill Australia Pty Ltd, New South Wales, 2005, p.1184.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''consumption map''' or '''efficiency map'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QAGHZPVnnSAC&amp;pg=PA540 Dieter Lohse und Werner Schnabel: ''Grundlagen der Straßenverkehrstechnik und der Verkehrsplanung: Band 1'', Beuth Verlag, 2011, ISBN 9783410172710.]&lt;/ref&gt; shows the [[Brake specific fuel consumption|brake-specific fuel consumption]] in g per kWh over [[mean effective pressure]] per [[rotational speed]] of an [[internal combustion engine]].

The x-axis shows the [[rotational speed]] range. The y-axis represents the load on the engine. The [[contour line]]s show the specific fuel consumption, indicating the areas of the speed/load regime where the engine is more or less efficient.

The map contains each possible condition, combining rotational speed and [[mean effective pressure]]. It shows the result of specific fuel consumption. A typical rotation power output '''P''' (linear to &lt;math&gt;p_{e} \cdot \omega&lt;/math&gt; ) is reached on several locations on the map but differing in the amount of fuel consumption. [[Automatic transmission]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, are designed to keep the engine at the speed with the lowest possible fuel consumption, given the power demand.

The map also shows the efficiency of the engine. Depending on the fuel type, [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline]] engines reach up to 210&amp;nbsp;g/kWh and about 40% efficiency. Using [[natural gas]] this efficiency is reached at 200&amp;nbsp;g/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Golloch, ''Downsizing bei Dieselmotoren'', Abschnitt ''2.1.3 Verbrennung'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Average values&lt;ref&gt;Table 1 in Konrad Reif, "''Dieselmotor-Management im Überblick''", Abschnitt  Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-658-06554-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are 160–180&amp;nbsp;g/kWh for slow moving [[two stroke]] diesel boat engines using [[fuel oil]], reaching up to 55% efficiency at 300&amp;nbsp;rpm. 195–210&amp;nbsp;g/kWh at cooled and pre-[[Turbocharger|charged]] [[diesel engines]] for passenger cars, trucks 195–225&amp;nbsp;g/kWh.

In [[quantum mechanics]], '''correspondence rules''' govern the principle of replacing physical quantities with [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]].

Such replacements include energy and momentum, which can be derived informally from taking the time and space derivities of the [[plane wave]] function. These show a similarity to the [[heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

Examples of correspondence rules include:
{|class="wikitable"
! Quantity !! Operator

A '''defence mechanism''' is an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] psychological mechanism that reduces anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |title=Psychology Second Edition |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |pages=482–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence mechanisms may result in healthy or unhealthy consequences depending on the circumstances and frequency with which the mechanism is used.&lt;ref name=utah&gt;[http://www.utahpsych.org/defensemechanisms.htm Utah Psych.

Healthy persons normally use different defences throughout life. An [[Human ego|ego]] defence mechanism becomes pathological only when its persistent use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or mental health of the individual is adversely affected. Among the purposes of ego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from [[anxiety]] or social sanctions or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one cannot currently cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029737/defence-mechanism |title=defence mechanisms --  Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=www.britannica.com |accessdate=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural model: Id, ego, and superego ==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
The concept of id impulses comes from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[structural model]]. According to this theory, [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] impulses are based on the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: instant gratification of one's own desires and needs. Sigmund Freud believed that the id represents biological instinctual impulses in humans, such as aggression ([[Thanatos]] or the Death instinct) and sexuality ([[Eros (love)|Eros]] or the Life instinct).

For example, when the id impulses (e.g., desire to have sexual relations with a stranger) conflict with the [[superego]] (e.g., belief in societal conventions of not having sex with unknown persons), unsatisfied feelings of anxiousness or feelings of anxiety come to the surface. To reduce these unpleasant feelings, the ego might use defence mechanisms (conscious or unconscious blockage of the id impulses).

Freud believed that conflicts between these two structures resulted in conflicts associated with [[psychosexual stages]].

===Definitions of individual psyche structures===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]
Freud proposed three structures of the psyche or personality:
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|Id]]''': The id is the unconscious reservoir of the libido, the psychic energy that fuels instincts and psychic processes. It is a selfish, childish, pleasure-oriented part of the personality with no ability to delay gratification.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego|Superego]]''':  The superego contains internalised societal and parental standards of "good" and "bad", "right" and "wrong" behaviour.  They include conscious appreciations of rules and regulations as well as those incorporated unconsciously.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]''': The ego acts as a moderator between the pleasure sought by the id and the morals of the superego, seeking compromises to pacify both. It can be viewed as the individual's "sense of time and place".

===Primary and secondary processes===
In the ego, there are two ongoing processes. First, there is the unconscious primary process, where the thoughts are not organised in a coherent way; the feelings can shift, contradictions are not in conflict or are just not perceived that way, and [[Condensation (psychology)|condensations]] arise. There is no logic and no time line. [[Lust]] is important for this process. By contrast, there is the conscious secondary process, where strong [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] are set and thoughts must be organised in a coherent way. Most conscious thoughts originate here.

===The reality principle===

Id impulses are not appropriate in a civilised society, so there is societal pressure to modify the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in favour of the [[reality principle]]; that is, the requirements of the external world.

===Formation of the superego===

The superego forms as the child grows and learns parental and social standards. The superego consists of two structures: the [[conscience]], which stores information about what is "bad" and what has been punished, and the [[ego ideal]], which stores information about what is "good" and what one "should" do or be.

===The ego's use of defence mechanisms===

When [[anxiety]] becomes overwhelming, it is the ego's place to protect the person by employing defence mechanisms. [[guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[embarrassment]], and [[shame]] often accompany anxiety. In the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"&gt;Freud, A. (1937). ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'', London: Hogarth Press and Institute of Psycho-Analysis. (Revised edition: 1966 (US), 1968 (UK))&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Freud]] introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was "not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

The signalling function of anxiety is thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger. Defence mechanisms work by distorting the id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

== Theories and classifications ==

The list of defence mechanisms, with no theoretical consensus on the exact number.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Classifying defence mechanisms according to some of their properties (like underlying mechanisms, similarities or connections with personality) has been attempted. Different theorists have different categorizations and conceptualizations of defence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., and Hayes S. (1997). Psychological defense: Contemporary theory and research. In {{cite book |author1=Briggs, Stephen |author2=Hogan, Robert Goode |author3=Johnson, John W. |title=Handbook of personality psychology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1997 |pages=543–579 |isbn=0-12-134646-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cramer (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, P. (1991). The Development of Defense Mechanisms: Theory, Research, and Assessment. New York, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Personality'' published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.1998.66.issue-6/issuetoc Special issue] [on defense mechanisms], ''Journal of Personality'' (1998), '''66''' (6): 879–1157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, [[Anna Freud]] enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, [[Sigmund Freud]]: 1. [[Psychological repression|Repression]], 2. [[Regression (psychology)|Regression]], 3. [[Reaction formation]], 4. [[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]], 5. [[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]], 6. [[Psychological projection|Projection]], 7. [[Introjection]], 8. [[self-harm|Turning against one's own person]], 9. Reversal into the opposite, 10. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref name="Szondi1956"&gt;Lipot Szondi (1956) [http://www.szondiforum.org/II.%20Szondi%20Ego%20Defenses%20and%20Sublimination.pdf ''Ego Analysis''] Ch. XIX, translated by Arthur C. Johnston, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious handle the stress of a social situation.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"&gt;Hock, Roger R. "Reading 30: You're Getting Defensive Again!" Forty Studies That Changed Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2013. 233–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Repression''': when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable.
*'''Regression''': falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as "less demanding and safer".&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Projection''': possessing a feeling that is deigned as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or "unconscious urge" is seen in the actions of other people.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Reaction formation''': acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, "often exaggerated and obsessive". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Sublimation''': seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;

[[Otto F. Kernberg]] (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be [[borderline personality disorder]]. His theory is based on ego psychological [[object relations theory]]. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.&lt;ref name="pmid4861171"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kernberg O |title=Borderline personality organization |journal=J Am Psychoanal Assoc |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=641–85 |date=July 1967 |pmid=4861171 |doi= 10.1177/000306516701500309|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Eman Vaillant]]'s (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their [[Developmental stage theories|psychoanalytical developmental level]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vaillant, George E. |title=Adaptation to life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-316-89520-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2013}} They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and "mature" defences.

[[Robert Plutchik]]'s (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic [[emotions]], which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures.  According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik, R., Kellerman, H., &amp; Conte, H. R. (1979). A structural theory of ego defences and emotions. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), Emotions in personality and psychopathology (pp. 229–-257). New
York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]])'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.

== Vaillant's categorization ==
{{Refimprove section |date=June 2013}}
Psychiatrist [[George Eman Vaillant]] introduced a four-level classification of defence mechanisms:&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting the Self|last=Cramer|first=Phebe|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=May 2006|isbn=9781593855284|location=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNsmzy-lLagC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Level I – pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)
*Level II – immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)
*Level III – neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)
*Level IV – mature defences (humour, sublimation, suppression, altruism, anticipation)

===Level 1: "Psychotic"===
When predominant, the mechanisms on this level are almost always severely [[Psychopathology|pathological]].  These six defences, in conjunction, permit one effectively to rearrange external experiences to eliminate the need to cope with reality.  Pathological users of these mechanisms frequently appear irrational or [[Insanity|insane]] to others. These are the "psychotic" defences, common in overt [[psychosis]].  However, they are normally found in [[dream]]s and throughout childhood as well.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"&gt;Vaillant, G. E., Bond, M., &amp; Vaillant, C. O. (1986). An empirically validated hierarchy of defence mechanisms. Archives of General Psychiatry, 73, 786–794. George Eman Valillant&lt;/ref&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Delusion|Delusional projection]]''': Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature.
*'''[[Denial]]''': Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening; arguing against an anxiety-provoking stimulus by stating it doesn't exist; resolution of emotional conflict and reduction of anxiety by refusing to perceive or consciously acknowledge the more unpleasant aspects of external reality.
*'''[[Cognitive distortion|Distortion]]''': A gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs.

===Level 2: Immature===
These mechanisms are often present in adults. These mechanisms lessen distress and anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality.  Excessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable, in that they are immature, difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality.  These are the so-called "immature" defences and overuse almost always leads to serious problems in a person's ability to cope effectively.  These defences are often seen in [[major depression]] and [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Acting out]]''': Direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, without conscious awareness of the emotion that drives the expressive behavior.
*'''[[Hypochondriasis]]''': An excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness.
*'''[[Passive-aggressive behavior]]''': Indirect expression of hostility
*'''[[Psychological projection|Projection]]''': A primitive form of [[paranoia]]. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the undesirable impulses or desires without becoming consciously aware of them; attributing one's own unacknowledged, unacceptable, or unwanted thoughts and emotions to another; includes severe [[prejudice]] and [[Envy|jealousy]], [[hypervigilance]] to external danger, and "injustice collecting", all with the aim of shifting one's unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses onto someone else, such that those same thoughts, feelings, beliefs and motivations are perceived as being possessed by the other.
*'''[[Fantasy (psychology)|Schizoid fantasy]]''': Tendency to retreat into fantasy in order to resolve inner and outer conflicts.

===Level 3: Neurotic===
These mechanisms are considered [[neurosis|neurotic]], but fairly common in adults. Such defences have short-term advantages in coping, but can often cause long-term problems in relationships, work and in enjoying life when used as one's primary style of coping with the world.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''': defence mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses to a more acceptable or less threatening target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening.  For example, a parent may yell at their child because they are angry with their spouse.
*'''[[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]]''': Temporary drastic modification of one's personal identity or character to avoid emotional distress; separation or postponement of a feeling that normally would accompany a situation or thought.
*'''[[Intellectualization]]''': A form of isolation; concentrating on the intellectual components of a situation so as to distance oneself from the associated anxiety-provoking emotions; separation of emotion from ideas; thinking about wishes in formal, affectively bland terms and not acting on them; avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects ([[Solitude|isolation]], [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], [[ritual]], [[Undoing (psychology)|undoing]], [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]], and [[magical thinking]]).
*'''[[Reaction formation]]''': Converting unconscious wishes or impulses that are perceived to be dangerous or unacceptable into their opposites; behaviour that is completely the opposite of what one really wants or feels; taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety.
*'''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''': The process of attempting to repel desires towards pleasurable instincts, caused by a threat of suffering if the desire is satisfied; the desire is moved to the unconscious in the attempt to prevent it from entering consciousness;&lt;ref name="LaplancheP390"&gt;Laplanche pp. 390, 392{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seemingly unexplainable naivety, memory lapse or lack of awareness of one's own situation and condition; the emotion is conscious, but the idea behind it is absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.vcu.edu/home/resources/pipc/Other/Personality/Table_Defenses.pdf Psychological Defenses from DSM-IV (see Repression)], Virginia Commonwealth University. Retrieved on December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 4: Mature===
These are commonly found among emotionally healthy adults and are considered mature, even though many have their origins in an immature stage of development. They have been adapted through the years in order to optimise success in human society and relationships. The use of these defences enhances pleasure and feelings of control. These defences help to integrate conflicting emotions and thoughts, whilst still remaining effective.  Those who use these mechanisms are usually considered [[virtue|virtuous]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
Mature defences include:
*'''[[Altruism]]''': Constructive service to others that brings pleasure and personal satisfaction.
*'''[[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]]''': Realistic planning for future discomfort.
*'''[[Humour]]''': Overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about directly) that gives pleasure to others. The thoughts retain a portion of their innate distress, but they are "skirted around" by witticism, for example [[self-deprecation]].
*'''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''': Transformation of unhelpful emotions or instincts into healthy actions, behaviours, or emotions, for example, playing a heavy contact sport such as football or rugby can transform aggression into a game.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483"&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011), ''Psychology'' (2nd edition), Worth Publishers, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Thought suppression|Suppression]]''': The conscious decision to delay paying attention to a thought, emotion, or need in order to cope with the present reality; making it possible later to access uncomfortable or distressing emotions whilst accepting them.

=== Pathological ===
*'''[[Conversion syndrome|Conversion]]''': The expression of an intrapsychic conflict as a physical symptom; some examples include blindness, deafness, paralysis, or numbness. This phenomenon is sometimes called ''hysteria''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R.. "Chapter 14." Psychology: the science of behaviour. Fourth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto, Ont.: Pearson Education Canada Inc., 2010. 456. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]]''':  A primitive defence.  Both harmful and helpful impulses are split off and unintegrated, frequently projected onto someone else.  The defended individual segregates experiences into all-good and all-bad categories, with no room for ambiguity and ambivalence.  When "splitting" is combined with "projecting", the undesirable qualities that one unconsciously perceives oneself as possessing, one consciously attributes to another.&lt;ref name="McWilliams"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychoanalytic Diagnosis: Understanding Personality Structure in the Clinical Process, Second Edition|last=McWilliams|first=Nancy|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1609184940|location=New York, NY|pages=60,63,103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immature ===
*'''[[Idealization and devaluation|Idealization]]''': Tending to perceive another individual as having more desirable qualities than he or she may actually have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ny6wkHI9qUcC&amp;pg=PA238|title=Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers|last=Vaillant|first=George Eman|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-88048-404-7|page=238|authorlink=George Eman Vaillant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Introjection]]''': Identifying with some idea or object so deeply that it becomes a part of that person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on attributes of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.
*'''[[Passive–aggressive behaviour|Passive aggression]]''': Aggression towards others expressed indirectly or passively, often through [[procrastination]].
*'''[[Projective identification]]''': The object of [[Psychological projection|projection]] invokes in that person a version of the thoughts, feelings or behaviours projected.
*'''[[Somatization]]''': The transformation of uncomfortable feelings towards others into uncomfortable feelings toward oneself: pain, illness, and anxiety.
*'''[[Wishful thinking]]''': Making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality.

=== Neurotic ===
*'''[[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]]''': Separation of feelings from ideas and events, for example, describing a murder with graphic details with no emotional response.
*'''[[Rationalization (making excuses)]]''': Convincing oneself that no wrong has been done and that all is or was all right through faulty and false reasoning. An indicator of this defence mechanism can be seen socially as the formulation of convenient excuses.
*'''[[Regression (psychology)|Regression]]''': Temporary reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adult way, for example, using whining as a method of communicating despite already having acquired the ability to speak with an appropriate level of maturity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483" /&gt;  
*'''[[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]]''':  A person tries to 'undo' an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought by acting out the reverse of the unacceptable. Involves symbolically nullifying an unacceptable or guilt provoking thought, idea, or feeling by confession or atonement.
*'''[[Social comparison|Upward and downward social comparisons]]''': A defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. Individuals will look to another individual or comparison group who are considered to be worse off in order to dissociate themselves from perceived similarities and to make themselves feel better about themselves or their personal situation.
*'''[[Solitude|Withdrawal]]''':  Withdrawal is a more severe form of defence. It entails removing oneself from events, stimuli, and interactions under the threat of being reminded of painful thoughts and feelings.

=== Mature ===
*'''[[Acceptance]]''': A person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest the path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and unchangeable, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.
*'''[[Courage]]''': The mental ability and willingness to confront conflicts, fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, despair, obstacles, vicissitudes or intimidation. Physical courage often extends lives, while moral courage preserves the ideals of justice and fairness.
*'''[[Emotion regulation|Emotional self-regulation]]''': The ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable. Emotional self-regulation refers to the processes people use to modify the type, intensity, duration, or expression of various emotions.
*'''[[Emotional resilience|Emotional self-sufficiency]]''': Not being dependent on the validation (approval or disapproval) of others.
*'''[[Forgiveness]]''': Cessation of resentment, indignation or anger as a result of a perceived offence, disagreement, or mistake, or ceasing to demand retribution or restitution.
*'''[[Gratitude]]''': A feeling of thankfulness or appreciation involving appreciation of a wide range of people and events. Gratitude is likely to bring higher levels of happiness, and lower levels of depression and stress. Throughout history, gratitude has been given a central position in religious and philosophical theories.
*'''[[Humility]]''': A mechanism by which a person, considering their own defects, has a humble self-opinion. Humility is intelligent self-respect which keeps one from thinking too highly or too meanly of oneself.
*'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''': The unconscious modelling of one's self upon another person's character and behaviour.
*'''[[Mercy]]''': Compassionate behavior on the part of those in power.
*'''[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]]''': Adopting an orientation (characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance) toward one's experiences in the present moment.
*'''[[Moderation]]''': The process of eliminating or lessening extremes and staying within reasonable limits. It necessitates self-restraint which is imposed by oneself on one's own feelings, desires etc.
*'''[[Patience]]''': Enduring difficult circumstances (delay, provocation, criticism, attack etc.) for some time before responding negatively.
*'''[[Respect]]''': Willingness to show consideration or appreciation. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of a person or feeling being and also specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Relationships and contacts that are built without the presence of respect are seldom long term or sustainable. The lack of respect is at the very heart of most conflict in families, communities, and nations.
*'''[[Toleration|Tolerance]]''': The practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves.

There are many different perspectives on how the construct of ''defence'' relates to the construct of ''[[Coping (psychology)|coping]]''; some writers differentiate the constructs in various ways, but "an important literature exists that does not make any difference between the two concepts".&lt;ref name="pmid19883526"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer |first=Ueli |title=Coping and defence mechanisms: What's the difference? - Second act |journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice |volume=83 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=207–221 |date=June 2010 |pmid=19883526 |doi=10.1348/147608309X475989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one of his books, [[George Eman Vaillant]] stated that he "will use the terms ''adaptation'', ''resilience'', ''coping'', and ''defense'' interchangeably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaillant |first=George E. |authorlink=George Eman Vaillant |date=2012 |title=Triumphs of experience: the men of the Harvard Grant Study |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674059825 |oclc=792887462 |doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674067424 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;pg=PA262 262] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Solid principles}}
In [[object-oriented design]], the '''dependency inversion principle''' is a specific form of [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]] software [[Modular programming|module]]s. When following this principle, the conventional [[dependency (computer science)|dependency]] relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. The principle states:&lt;ref name="Martin2003"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind points A and B of this principle is that when designing the interaction between a high-level module and a low-level one, the interaction should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them. This not only has implications on the design of the high-level module, but also on the low-level one: the low-level one should be designed with the interaction in mind and it may be necessary to change its usage interface.

In many cases, thinking about the interaction in itself as an abstract concept allows the coupling of the components to be reduced without introducing additional coding patterns, allowing only a lighter and less implementation dependent interaction schema.

When the discovered abstract interaction schema(s) between two modules is/are generic and generalization makes sense, this design principle also leads to the following dependency inversion coding pattern.

==Traditional layers pattern==
In conventional application architecture, lower-level components (e.g. Utility Layer) are designed to be consumed by higher-level components (e.g. Policy Layer) which enable increasingly complex systems to be built. In this composition, higher-level components depend directly upon lower-level components to achieve some task. This dependency upon lower-level components limits the reuse opportunities of the higher-level components.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

[[File:Traditional Layers Pattern.png|center]]

The goal of the dependency inversion pattern is to avoid this highly coupled distribution with the mediation of an abstract layer, and to  increase the re-usability of higher/policy layers.

==Dependency inversion pattern==
With the addition of an abstract layer, both high- and lower-level layers reduce the traditional dependencies from top to bottom. Nevertheless, the "inversion" concept does not mean that lower-level layers depend on higher-level layers. Both layers should depend on abstractions that draw the behavior needed by higher-level layers.

[[File:DIPLayersPattern.png|center]]

In a direct application of dependency inversion, the abstracts are owned by the upper/policy layers. This architecture groups the higher/policy components and the abstractions that define lower services together in the same package. The lower-level layers are created by inheritance/implementation of these abstract classes or interfaces.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

The inversion of the dependencies and ownership encourages the re-usability of the higher/policy layers. Upper layers could use other implementations of the lower services. When the lower-level layer components are closed or when the application requires the reuse of existing services, it is common that an [[adapter pattern|Adapter]] mediates between the services and the abstractions.

== Dependency inversion pattern generalization ==
In many projects the dependency inversion principle and pattern are considered as a single concept that should be generalized. There are at least two reasons for that:
# It is simpler to see a good thinking principle as a coding pattern. Once an abstract class or an interface has been coded, the programmer may say: "I have done the job of abstraction". 
# Because many unit testing tools rely on inheritance to accomplish mocking, the usage of generic interfaces between classes (not only between modules when it makes sense to use generality) became the rule.
If the mocking tool used relies only on inheritance, generalizing the dependency inversion pattern may become a necessity. This has major drawbacks:
# Simply implementing an interface over a class isn't sufficient and generally does not reduce coupling, only thinking about the potential abstraction of interactions can lead to a less coupled design.
# Implementing generic interfaces everywhere in a project makes it by far harder to understand and maintain. At each step the reader will ask themself what are the other implementations of this interface and the response is generally: only mocks. 
# The interface generalization requires more plumbing code, in particular factories that generally rely on a dependency-injection framework.
# Interface generalization also restricts the usage of the programming language.

===Generalization restrictions===
The presence of interfaces to accomplish the Dependency Inversion Pattern (DIP) have other design implications in an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented program]]:

* All member variables in a class must be interfaces or abstracts.
* All concrete class packages must connect only through interface or abstract class packages.
* No class should derive from a concrete class.
* No method should override an implemented method.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;
* All variable instantiation requires the implementation of a [[creational pattern]] such as the [[Factory method pattern|factory method]] or the [[Factory (object-oriented programming)|factory]] pattern, or the use of a [[dependency injection|dependency-injection]] framework.

===Interface mocking restrictions===
Using inheritance-based mocking tools also introduce restrictions:
* Static externally visible members should systematically rely on dependency injection making them far harder to implement.
* All testable methods should become an interface implementation or an override of an abstract definition.

===Future directions===
Principles are ways of thinking, patterns are common ways to solve problems. Coding patterns may be seen as missing programming language features.
* Programming languages will continue to evolve to allow to enforce stronger and more precise usage contracts, in at least two directions: enforcing usage conditions (pre-, post- and invariant conditions), and state-based interfaces. This will probably encourage and potentially simplify a stronger application of the dependency inversion pattern in many situations.
* More and more mocking tools now use code injection to solve the problem of replacing static and non virtual members. Programming language will probably evolve to generate mocking-compatible bytecode. One direction will be to restrict the usage of non virtual members, the other one will be to generate, at least in test situations, a bytecode allowing non-inheritance based mocking.

==Implementations==
Two common implementations of DIP use similar logical architecture, with different implications.

A direct implementation packages the policy classes with service abstracts classes in one library. In this implementation high-level components and low-level components are distributed into separate packages/libraries, where the [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] defining the behavior/services required by the high-level component are owned by, and exist within the high-level component's library. The implementation of the high-level component's interface by the low level component requires that the low-level component package depend upon the high-level component for compilation, thus inverting the conventional dependency relationship.

[[File:Dependency inversion.png|center]]

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate code with the same functionality, however in Figure 2, an interface has been used to invert the dependency. The direction of dependency can be chosen to maximize policy code reuse, and eliminate cyclic dependencies.

In this version of DIP, the lower layer component's dependency on the interfaces/abstracts in the higher-level layers makes re-utilization of the lower layer components difficult. This implementation instead ″inverts″ the traditional dependency from top-to-bottom to the opposite, from bottom-to-top.

A more flexible solution extracts the abstract components into an independent set of packages/libraries:

[[File:DIPLayersPattern v2.png|center]]

The separation of all layers into their own package encourages re-utilization of any layer, providing robustness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Genealogical module===
A genealogical system may represent relationship between people as a graph of first level relationships between them (father/son, father/daughter, mother/son, mother/daughter, husband/wife, wife/husband...). This is very efficient (and extensible: ex-husband/ex-wife, legal guardian...)

But the high level modules may require a simpler way to browse the system: a person may have children, a father, a mother, brothers and sisters (including or not half brothers and sisters), grandfathers, grandmothers, uncles, aunts, cousins ...

Depending on the usage of the genealogical module, presenting common relationships as distinct direct properties (hiding the graph) will make the coupling between the high-level module and the genealogical module by far lighter and allow one to change the internal representation completely without any effect on the using modules. It also allows one to embed in the genealogical module the exact definition of brother and sisters (including or not half ones), uncles ... allowing one to enforce the [[single responsibility principle]].

Finally, if the first extensible generalized graph approach seems the most extensible, the usage of the genealogical module may show that a more specialized and simpler relationship implementation is sufficient for the application(s) and helps you to make a more efficient system.

In this example abstracting the interaction between the modules leads to a simplified interface of the low-level module and may lead to a simpler implementation of it.

===Remote file server client===
Imagine you have to implement a client to a remote file server (FTP, cloud storage ...). You may think of it as a set of abstract interfaces:
#Connection/Disconnection (a connection persistence layer may be needed)
#Folder/tags creation/rename/delete/list interface
#File creation/replacement/rename/delete/read interface
#File searching
#Concurrent replacement or delete resolution
#File history management ...

If both local files and remote files offers the same abstract interfaces, any high-level module using local files and fully implementing the dependency inversion pattern will be able to access local and remote files indiscriminately.

Local disk will generally use folder, remote storage may use folder and/or tags. You have to decide how to unify them if possible.

On remote file we may have to use only create or replace: remote files update do not necessarily make sense because random update is too slow comparing local file random update and may be very complicated to implement). On remote file we may need partial read and write (at least inside the remote file module to allow download or upload to resume after a communication interruption), but random read isn't adapted (except if a local cache is used).

File searching may be pluggable : file searching can rely on the OS or in particular for tag or full text search, be implemented with distinct systems (OS embedded, or available separately).

Concurrent replacement or delete resolution detection may impact the other abstract interfaces.

When designing the remote file server client for each conceptual interface you have to ask yourself the level of service your high level modules require (not necessary all of them) and not only how to implement the remote file server functionalities but maybe how to make the file services in your application compatible between already implemented file services (local files, existing cloud clients) and your new remote file server client.

Once you have designed the abstract interfaces required, your remote file server client should implement these interfaces. And because you probably restricted some local functionalities existing on local file (for example file update), you may have to write [[Adapter pattern|adapters]] for local or other existing used remote file access modules each offering the same abstract interfaces. You also have to write your own file access enumerator allowing to retrieve all file compatible systems available and configured on your computer.

Once you do that, your application will be able to save its documents locally or remotely transparently. Or simpler, the high level module using the new file access interfaces can be used indistinctly in local or remote file access scenarios making it reusable.

Remark : many OSes have started to implement these kind of functionalities and your work may be limited to adapt your new client to this already abstracted models.

In this example, thinking of the module as a set of abstract interfaces, and adapting other modules to this set of interfaces, allows you to provide a common interface for many file storage systems.

===Model View Controller===

[[File:DIP concrete example.png|center|Example of DIP]]

UI and ApplicationLayer packages contains mainly concrete classes. Controllers contains  abstracts/interface types. UI has an instance of ICustomerHandler. All packages are physically separated.  In the ApplicationLayer there is a concrete implementation that Page class will use. Instances of this interface are created dynamically by a Factory (possibly in the same Controllers package). The concrete types, Page and CustomerHandler, don't depend on each other; both depend on ICustomerHandler.

The direct effect is that the UI doesn't need to reference the ApplicationLayer or any concrete package that implements the ICustomerHandler. The concrete class will be loaded using reflection. At any moment the concrete implementation could be replaced by another concrete implementation without changing the UI class. Another interesting possibility is that the Page class implements an interface IPageViewer that could be passed as an argument to ICustomerHandler methods. Then the concrete implementation could communicate with UI without a concrete dependency. Again, both are linked by interfaces.

==Related patterns==
Applying the dependency inversion principle can also be seen as an example of the [[adapter pattern]], i.e. the high-level class defines its own adapter interface which is the abstraction that the other high-level classes depend on. The adaptee implementation also depends on the adapter interface abstraction (of course, since it implements its interface) while it can be implemented by using code from within its own low-level module. The high-level has no dependency on the low-level module since it only uses the low-level indirectly through the adapter interface by invoking polymorphic methods to the interface which are implemented by the adaptee and its low-level module.

Various patterns such as Plugin, [[Service locator pattern|Service Locator]], or [[Dependency Injection]] are employed to facilitate the run-time provisioning of the chosen low-level component implementation to the high-level component.

==History==
The dependency inversion principle was postulated by [[Robert C. Martin]] and described in several publications including the paper ''Object Oriented Design Quality Metrics: an analysis of dependencies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://linux.ime.usp.br/~joaomm/mac499/arquivos/referencias/oodmetrics.pdf|title=Object Oriented Design Quality Metrics: An analysis of dependencies|last=Martin|first=Robert C.|date=|website=|publisher=|publication-date=October 1994|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article appearing in the C++ Report in May 1996 entitled ''The Dependency Inversion Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf|title=The Dependency Inversion Principle|last=Martin|first=Robert C.|date=May 1996|website=|publisher=C++ Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714224327/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-14|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the books ''Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices'',&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; and ''Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#''.

'''Edward S. Miller''' was the Deputy Assistant Director of the Inspections Division under [[Mark Felt]] with the [[United States]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

In November 1980, Miller, then head of the FBI's Domestic Intelligence Division, and Mark Felt were convicted after a seven-week federal jury trial of having "conspired to injure and oppress the citizens of the United States" and Miller was fined $3,500. While the convictions were being appealed in April 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] [[pardon]]ed both men. At the time of trial, Felt and Miller were the highest-ranking bureau employees to have been tried for a [[criminal offense]].&lt;ref name="nytpardon"&gt;Pear, Robert (April 16, 1981).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7805">In [[mathematics]], an '''exceptional isomorphism''', also called an '''accidental isomorphism''', is an [[isomorphism]] between members ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of two families, usually infinite, of mathematical objects, that is not an example of a pattern of such isomorphisms.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Because these series of objects are presented differently, they are not identical objects (do not have identical descriptions), but turn out to describe the same object, hence one refers to this as an isomorphism, not an equality (identity).&lt;/ref&gt; These coincidences are at times considered a matter of trivia,&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; but in other respects they can give rise to other phenomena, notably [[exceptional object]]s.&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; In the following, coincidences are listed wherever they occur.

== Groups ==

=== Finite simple groups ===
The exceptional isomorphisms between the series of [[finite simple group]]s mostly involve [[projective special linear group]]s and [[alternating group]]s, and are:&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Wilson | first1=Robert A. | authorlink = Robert Arnott Wilson | title=The finite simple groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] 251 | isbn=978-1-84800-987-5 | doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2 | year=2009 |chapter = Chapter 1: Introduction |chapterurl=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs_files/intro.ps | postscript =, [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html 2007 preprint]; Chapter {{doi|10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2_1}}. | zbl=1203.20012 | volume=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(4) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_2(5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5,&lt;/math&gt; the smallest non-abelian simple group (order 60);
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(7) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_3(2),&lt;/math&gt; the second-smallest non-abelian simple group (order 168) – [[PSL(2,7)]];
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \mathfrak{A}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_4(2) \cong \mathfrak{A}_8,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSU}_4(2) \cong \operatorname{PSp}_4(3),&lt;/math&gt; between a [[projective special orthogonal group]] and a [[projective symplectic group]].

=== Groups of Lie type ===
In addition to the aforementioned, there are some isomorphisms involving SL, PSL, GL, PGL, and the natural maps between these. For example, the groups over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_5&lt;/math&gt; have a number of exceptional isomorphisms:
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5 \cong \mathbb{I},&lt;/math&gt; the alternating group on five elements, or equivalently the [[icosahedral group]];
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PGL}(2,5) \cong \mathfrak{S}_5,&lt;/math&gt; the [[symmetric group]] on five elements;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}(2,5) \cong 2\mathfrak{A}_5 \cong 2\mathbb{I},&lt;/math&gt; the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], or equivalently the [[binary icosahedral group]].

=== Alternating groups and symmetric groups ===
[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|The [[compound of five tetrahedra]] expresses the exceptional isomorphism between the icosahedral group and the alternating group on five letters.]]
There are coincidences between alternating groups and small groups of Lie type:
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(4) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_2(5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \operatorname{Sp}_4(2)' \cong \mathfrak{A}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sp}_4(2) \cong \mathfrak{S}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_4(2) \cong \operatorname{O}_6^+(2)' \cong \mathfrak{A}_8,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{O}_6^+(2) \cong \mathfrak{S}_8.&lt;/math&gt;
These can all be explained in a systematic way by using linear algebra (and the action of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; on affine &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-space)
to define the isomorphism going from the right side to the left side. (The above isomorphisms for &lt;math&gt;A_8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_8&lt;/math&gt; are linked via the exceptional isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}_4/\mu_2 \cong \operatorname{SO}_6&lt;/math&gt;.)
There are also some coincidences with symmetries of [[regular polyhedra]]: the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; agrees with the [[icosahedral group]] (itself an exceptional object), and the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover]] of the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[binary icosahedral group]].

=== Cyclic groups ===
Cyclic groups of small order especially arise in various ways, for instance:
* &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{C}_2 \cong \{\pm1\} \cong \operatorname{O}(1) \cong \operatorname{Spin}(1) \cong \mathbb Z^\times&lt;/math&gt;, the last being the group of units of the integers.

=== Spheres ===
The spheres ''S''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; admit group structures, which can be described in many ways:
* &lt;math&gt; S^0\cong\operatorname{O}(1)\cong\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; ,
* &lt;math&gt; S^1\cong\operatorname{SO}(2)\cong\operatorname{U}(1)\cong\operatorname{Spin}(2)\cong \mathbb R/\mathbb Z \cong &lt;/math&gt; [[circle group]]
* &lt;math&gt; S^3\cong\operatorname{Spin}(3)\cong\operatorname{SU}(2)\cong\operatorname{Sp}(1)\cong&lt;/math&gt; [[versors|unit quaternions]].

=== Coxeter groups ===
[[File:Dynkin Diagram Isomorphisms.svg|thumb|upright|The exceptional isomorphisms of connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s.]]
There are some exceptional isomorphisms of [[Coxeter diagram]]s, yielding isomorphisms of the corresponding Coxeter groups and of polytopes realizing the symmetries. These are:
* A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) (2-simplex is regular 3-gon/triangle);
* BC2 = I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4) (2-cube (square) = 2-cross-polytope (diamond) = regular 4-gon)
* A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (3-simplex (tetrahedron) is 3-demihypercube (demicube), as per diagram)
* A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (= D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;?)
* D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
* A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

Closely related ones occur in Lie theory for [[Dynkin diagram#Isomorphisms|Dynkin diagrams]].

== Lie theory ==

In low dimensions, there are isomorphisms among the classical Lie algebras and among the classical Lie groups called ''accidental isomorphisms''. For instance, there are isomorphisms between low-dimensional [[spin group]]s and certain classical Lie groups, due to low-dimensional isomorphisms between the [[root systems]] of the different families of [[simple Lie algebra]]s, visible as isomorphisms of the corresponding Dynkin diagrams:
* Trivially, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}_2 = \mathfrak{sp}_1 \cong \mathfrak{so}_3&lt;/math&gt;
* ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}_5 \cong \mathfrak{sp}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
* ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}_{4} \cong \mathfrak{sl}_2 \oplus \mathfrak{sl}_2 &lt;/math&gt;; note that these are disconnected, but part of the ''D''-series
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}_4 \cong \mathfrak{so}_6&lt;/math&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; the ''E''-series usually starts at 6, but can be started at 4, yielding isomorphisms
* ''D''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

:Spin(1) = [[Orthogonal group|O(1)]]
:Spin(2) = [[Unitary group|U(1)]] = [[Special orthogonal group|SO(2)]]
:Spin(3) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]] = [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]
:Spin(4) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]] &amp;times; [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]]
:Spin(5) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(2)]]
:Spin(6) = [[Special unitary group|SU(4)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">{{short description|A confession obtained from a person under duress}}
A '''forced confession''' is a confession obtained from a suspect or a [[prison]]er by means of [[torture]] (including [[enhanced interrogation technique]]s) or other forms of [[duress]]. Depending on the level of coercion used, a forced confession is not valid in revealing the truth. The person being interrogated may agree to the story presented to him or even make up falsehoods himself in order to satisfy the interrogator and discontinue his suffering.&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffa|first1=Christa|title=Palazz Castellania|url=http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania#.V5yZyPl961t|work=Illum|date=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730125955/http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania|archivedate=30 July 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries the Latin phrase "''Confessio est regina probationum''" (In [[English language|English]]: Confession is the [[Queen of evidence]]) justified the use of forced confession in the European legal system. When especially during the [[Middle Ages]] acquiring a confession was the most important thing during preparations before a trial, than the method used to get the confession seemed irrelevant, [[de facto]] sanctioning the use of torture to extract forced confession. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

By the late 18th century, most scholars and lawyers thought of the forced confession not only as a relic of past times and morally wrong but also ineffective as the victim of torture may confess to anything just to ease their suffering.

Developments in the 20th century, notably the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], greatly reduced the legal acceptance of forced confessions.  However, for most of legal history they have been accepted in most of the world, and are still accepted in some jurisdictions.

==Modern day usage==
Since 2001, as part of its [[War on Terror]] the United States using the [[CIA]] operates a network of off shore prisons, called [[black site]]s, probably the most famous of which is [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]].
State officials have admitted to the press and in court to be using various torture techniques (authorised by the District attorney) to interrogate suspects of terrorism, sometimes after [[forced disappearance]] or [[extraordinary rendition by the United States]]. 

When these systematic acts were made public by the international media, the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]], the international press and various human rights movements condemned their practice.
The US Supreme Court did not discontinue their usage and repeatedly ruled against hearing citizens that underwent forced confessions, even after they were found innocent, claiming that a trial would constitute a breach of national security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/extraordinaryrendition/22201res20051206.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous case is that of [[Khalid El-Masri]]. He appealed several times aided by different international human rights movements and lawyers, yet the US Supreme Court retained its usage of forced confession techniques, and denied a hearing of the evidence.

===Forced televised confessions in China===

The [[People's Republic of China]] systematically employed forced televised confession against [[list of Chinese dissidents|Chinese dissidents]] and workers of various [[human rights group]] in an attempt to discredit, smear and suppress dissident voices and activism, as well as part of the state propaganda. These scripted confessions, obtained via systematic [[duress]] and [[torture]], are broadcast on the [[China Central Television|state television]]. Notable victims includes [[Wang Yu (lawyer)|Wang Yu]], a female [[human rights]] [[lawyer]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] citizen [[Peter Dahlin]], an [[NGO]] worker and [[human rights activist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/asia/china-confession-cctv.html|title=China Uses Foreigners’ Televised Confessions to Serve Its Own Ends|last=Wong|first=Edward|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theinitium.com/article/20180709-opinion-luosiling-peter-dahlin-forced-confession/|title=瑞典人彼得·達林：我在中國上電視認罪，《1984》噩夢成為現實|website=theinitium.com|language=zh-Hant|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/world/asia/china-forced-confessions-propaganda.html|title=How China Uses Forced Confessions as Propaganda Tool|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known as a critic of [[Judeo-Christian]] morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of [[free will]], which, in his opinion, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 68-69: "He also ''shares'' with the Materialists a blanket repudiation of the idea of free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26, tr. [[H. L. Mencken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schopenhauer==
In ''[[The Gay Science]]'', Nietzsche praises [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book2.html The Gay Science]'', 99, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 59: "Schopenhauer's picture is, in fact, richer than this, and important for understanding Nietzsche." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The principle of causality===
In ''Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' Schopenhauer claimed to prove &amp;ndash; in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and against [[David Hume|Hume]] &amp;ndash; that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called [[apriority]] of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen "on principle" ([[empiricism]] of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on [[Free will#Free will and views of causality|free will]].

===Physical freedom===
In his treatise ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', 1839, c. 1 (explanation of terms), "What is meant by freedom?". [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98022360.pdf First chapter online]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically "free" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: "is will itself willed?," "do you will the will to become so-and-so?". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in ''Thus spake Zarathustra'', for instance in the chapter "Backworldsmen."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The backworldsmen", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity vs. contingency===
In ''On the Freedom of the Will'', Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency.&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; He calls "necessary" what follows from a given sufficient basis&lt;ref&gt;Such sufficient basis can then be transcribed as the presence of all the necessary conditions of the occurrence of an effect. As long as it is possible to point out some necessary conditions of an event or state, so long there also exists a sufficient basis, which in case of its occurrence will work with necessity; it is dictated by logic. ''Cf.'' there, c. 4 ("Precursors"), a quote from Hobbes. This does not preclude the inclusion of an accurate realization of a certain random variable in a sufficient basis.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls "contingent"&lt;ref&gt;''Zufällig'' is the German adjective combining all the meanings of chance, randomness, fortuity, and contingency; the same situation in several other European languages. Perhaps ''fortuitous'' or ''random'' to something could better suit the intuitive meaning, and such translation of this scholastic term is sometimes used. The term is sometimes used in a misleading way so that it denotes in general all "instances [products] of a rule" (which are indeed contingent to each other), and then lack of necessity is triumphantly announced (like in the case of St. Thomas Aquinas), whereas one in fact agrees that there are still causes (so another connection-by-necessity must exist); this is the so-called relative fortuity of events. For Schopenhauer it is the starting point for discussion about absolute fortuity and lack of causes.&lt;/ref&gt; or "incidental" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As ''moral'' freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of ''any'' basis: it "would have to be defined as ''absolutely contingent''",&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; i.e. an '''[[Indeterminism#Philosophy|absolute fortuity, or chance]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The above-mentioned classification of phenomena in Schopenhauer's works is not really a methodology or a kind of optics, but simply a notice that either an event or a state is determined (by another, by anything) or it is not (by another, by anything; like in case of a choice when all its directing forces – will, values, all emotional aspects – are rejected or unworking). Thus philosophers even before Schopenhauer have already thought that everything is either necessary or fortuitous and as much as one does not apply, the other does; so for instance in Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'', where the distinction is one of categories of reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.

==Nietzsche's analysis==

===Power of will===
In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively.&lt;ref name="BGE"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 21, tr. H. Zimmern&lt;/ref&gt; He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a ''crass stupidity''. The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still "beyond time"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does.&lt;ref&gt;Why then it does not surprise man? Cf. the so-called [[Argument from free will|paradox of omniscience]], according to which there is a contradiction between visions of a live and free God and omniscience or even the possibility of omniscience.&lt;/ref&gt; (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in ''The Antichrist''.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 48, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, he argues that free will generally represents an error of ''causa sui'':&lt;ref&gt;That is, "X is the cause of X" &amp;ndash; whereas "cause" should in philosophy be usually something else than effect. The terms ''causa sui'' (cause of self, here considered a fallacy), ''causa prima'' (first cause), and absolute randomness have a common logical sense with respect to states and events in the universe, but occur in different philosophical contexts and with different aspects of meaning and associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The &lt;u&gt;desire&lt;/u&gt; for "freedom of will" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this ''causa sui'', and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Finally, he suggests that the only ''real'' thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:

{{Quotation|The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of ''strong'' and ''weak'' will.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Nothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', c. 3, sect. 2, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: "whether you will, what you willed to will".&lt;ref&gt;The composition actually already known to Hegel, in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', 27, written in 1821. In Schopenhauer's essay an infinite regression arises upon considering this issue, when one assumes the fixed answer Yes to the question about freedom; so a logical fallacy occurs. This already can suggest that there is a problem with searching for cause of everything one does in consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will is generally considered a mental power. "Freedom" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology&lt;ref name="A14"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are ''determined'' by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) &amp;ndash; Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his ''values'' over him, of the will for truthfulness...

==="Me", will, and chance===
[[Volition (psychology)|Will]] is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc.  It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. ''The Antichrist'' about Christians: "in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 44, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term "me" and "chance" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).

The term "me" (as in the statements "it's up to me", "it is ''you'' who willed that") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of ''Beyond Good and Evil''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', Preface, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; (or as connected with the ''superstition about the soul''). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] ("what will I do? what will my decision be?" &amp;ndash; "it's up to ''you''" &amp;ndash; that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm On the Genealogy of Morals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192122/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm |date=2014-10-08 }}'', treatise I, 13, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an ''action'', as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is ''free'' to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; &lt;u&gt;there is no "being" behind the doing, acting, becoming&lt;/u&gt;. "The doer" is merely made up and added into the action &amp;ndash; the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: &lt;u&gt;when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect&lt;/u&gt;. (...) "We weak people are merely weak. It's good if we do nothing; ''we are not strong enough for that''" &amp;ndash; but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do "too much"), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, &lt;u&gt;just as if the weakness of the weak man himself&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; that means his ''essence'', his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an ''act'', ''something of merit''&lt;/u&gt;.}}

The same however can be applied to the ''moral'' weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. "And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67a/part1.html#chapter3 Thus spake Zarathustra]'', tr. T. Common, "Old and new tables", 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Nietzsche criticizes the idea of "free choice", and even of "choice" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to "choose", man wants to affirm himself ("[[will to power]]").&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Belfiore, ''The Triadic Structure of the Mind: Outlines of a Philosophical System'' (2nd edition), Univ. Press of America, 2014, p. 380: "My comment is that Nietzsche, as I point out elsewhere (...), conceived the will to power as the expression of the outward/selfish desire of the agent to affirm and impose on others his apirations, interests and preferences, regardless to any inward/moral thought and feeling." See also on p. 472: "Again with regard to the &amp;laquo;will to power&amp;raquo;, he held that &amp;laquo;A living thing seeks above all to ''discharge'' its strength &amp;ndash; life itself is ''will to power''; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent ''results''&amp;raquo;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, ''wherever there is will''. He calls it "the redemption (of chance)". This topic dawns as early as in ''Human, All Too Human'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Human All-Too-Human#SECOND DIVISION - The History Of The Moral Sentiments.|Human, All Too Human'', 173, under the topic: ''Corriger la fortune'' (to correct a chance), tr. R.J. Hollingdale.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it returns in many places of ''Zarathustra''. For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:

::I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.
::&lt;u&gt;And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it&lt;/u&gt; (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Bedwarfing Virtue", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in this part:

::The time is now past when accidents ''[Zufälle]'' could befall me; and what could not fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', "The Wanderer".&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut it short, if it was always that "''we'' choose a chance", then there would be determinism (for "we", "we ourselves" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise ("a chance chooses us"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, ''adiaphora'', not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).

===Necessity in man. What is "unfree will"?===
Since free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if "freedom" meant "everything," there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events ''external'' to one's freedom: therefore, besides "free will" there should also consequently be "unfree will." Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the ''psychological'' reality behind them:

{{Quotation|When man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is ''not responsible'' for them &amp;mdash; they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: &lt;u&gt;the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it)&lt;/u&gt; needs an ''external'' will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of religion, 1. Genesis of Religions, &amp;sect;135, where he demonstrates the notion of "unfree will" as crucial to the emergence of many religious explanations. Vintage Books edition, September, 1968, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Magi-iz7kIQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=&amp;quot;136+(March-June+1888)&amp;quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcKHVB3dib&amp;sig=-9HqUzdC-rG-EJGaHY9P1NVGLwM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bUfVLCeEKT9ywP4_YKgAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22136%20(March-June%201888)%22&amp;f=false Online version here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, [[randomness|chance]] means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then "unfree will" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we ''feel'' something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:

::Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, &amp;mdash; where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (...)
::Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, &lt;u&gt;where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Old and new tables", 2, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same in ''Beyond Good and Evil'':

{{Quotation|Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax &amp;mdash; in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 213, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The universe indeterministic?===
Yet in another part of ''Zarathustra'' Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:

{{Quotation|If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, &lt;u&gt;and of the heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances&lt;/u&gt;: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Seven Seals", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gemes, J. Richardson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2013, p. 177-178 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;f=false Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 36, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; To exist is to represent will to power, to ''cause influence'' (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's ''Theaetetus''). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards).&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"&gt;This belief, perhaps not 100% deterministic, is explicitly expressed in ''Twilight of the Idols'', "Morality as Anti-Nature", 6, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale: "To say to him, &amp;laquo;Change yourself!&amp;raquo; is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]]'s views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"/&gt;

Several scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 64 ("Nietzsche on Freedom and Fatalism"). [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v023/23.1solomon.html Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche on morality'' (2nd edition), Routledge 2015, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBDEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;f=false Online text here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zarathustra'', absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:

{{Quotation|Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Before sunrise", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issues of responsibility and morality===
Because ''causa sui'' is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only "the whole" has no basis), and it would be "divine dice" (or "Divine Plan"):

::If ever I have played dice with the gods at the divine table of the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth fire-streams: &amp;ndash;
::&amp;ndash; For a divine table is the earth, and trembling with new active dictums and dice-casts of the gods: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3/&gt;

To Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly &amp;ndash; and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the "supreme being" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.

From ''The Dawn of Day'':

{{Quotation|To tranquillise the sceptic. &amp;ndash; "I don't know at all what I am doing. I don't know in the least what I ought to do!" You are right, but 
be sure of this: you are being done at every moment! Mankind has at all times mistaken the active for the passive: it is its eternal grammatical blunder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/dawnofday029675mbp/dawnofday029675mbp_djvu.txt The Dawn of Day]'', 120, tr. J. M. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche discusses [[fatalism]] and responsibility in these words:

{{Quotation|What alone can our teaching be? &amp;ndash; That no one gives a man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor ''he himself'' (the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as "intelligible freedom" by Kant, perhaps also by Plato). &lt;u&gt;''No one'' is responsible for existing at all&lt;/u&gt;, for being formed so and so, for being placed under those circumstances and in this environment. His own destiny cannot be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future. He is ''not'' the result of a special purpose, a will, or an aim, the attempt is ''not'' here made to reach an "ideal of man," an "ideal of happiness," or an "ideal of morality;" &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;it is absurd to try to ''shunt off'' man's nature towards some goal&lt;/u&gt;. We have invented the notion of a "goal:" in reality a goal is ''lacking'' . . . We are necessary, we are part of destiny, we belong to the whole, we ''exist'' in the whole, &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, and condemn the whole&lt;/u&gt; . . . ''But there is nothing outside the whole! &amp;ndash; This only is the grand emancipation'': that no one be made responsible any longer, that the mode of being be not traced back to a ''causa prima'', that the world be not regarded as a unity, either as sensorium or as "spirit;" &amp;ndash; it is only thereby that the ''innocence'' of becoming is again restored . . . The concept of "God" has hitherto been the greatest ''objection'' to existence . . . We deny God, we deny responsibility by denying God: it is only ''thereby'' that we save the world. &amp;ndash;&lt;ref name="TI_fw"&gt;''[http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 Twilight of the Idols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214453/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 |date=2016-03-03 }}'', "The Four Great Errors", 8, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Free will as a psychological error===
Nietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological.&lt;ref name="NTotW"&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche's Theory of the Will'', p. 1. [[Philosophers' Imprint]] v. 7, no. 7, September 2007. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/nietzsche-s-theory-of-the-will.pdf?c=phimp;idno=3521354.0007.007 Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which &amp;ndash; most generally speaking &amp;ndash; would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the "freedom of will" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.

If one agrees that the "freedom of will" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that "it is not there". And Nietzsche went on to this.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' (Leiter), p. 12 ("The Real Genesis of Action").&lt;/ref&gt; For Nietzsche the term "will" is psychologically strictly connected with the term "aim" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him.&lt;ref name="WTP"&gt;Cf. ''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of philosophy, 238: on "psychology which ... searched for will (i.e. aim) behind every act."&lt;/ref&gt; Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing&lt;ref&gt;The intellect in philosophy was by the way usually presented as working causally and, in principle, learning in course of life to associate the appropriate causes and effects. It was thus understood e.g. by Schopenhauer (cf. F. C. White, ''On Schopenhauer's Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', c. 4: "Perception," p. 42: Brill Academic Pub, 1991; [https://books.google.com/books?id=95X3LSZ9O04C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4t8t3huF0&amp;sig=_yZNYjtOD8g49uNcKKxGql5cn9w&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7gTVOfLEcvTPI_TgLgE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false read online]). The more thus the phenomena of will and aim would have a deterministic foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche demonstrates the ''error of false causality'' just before the ''error of free will'':

{{Quotation|Of these "inward facts" that seem to demonstrate causality, the primary and most persuasive one is that of &lt;u&gt;the will as cause&lt;/u&gt;. The idea of consciousness ("spirit") or, later, that of the ego ''[I]'' (the "subject") as a cause are only afterbirths: first the causality of the will was firmly accepted as proved, as a fact, and these other concepts followed from it. But we have reservations about these concepts. &lt;u&gt;Today we no longer believe any of this is true&lt;/u&gt;. (...) The so-called motives: another error. &lt;u&gt;Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something shadowing&lt;ref&gt;"Accompanying" in original.&lt;/ref&gt; the deed&lt;/u&gt; that is more likely to hide the causes of our actions than to reveal them. (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The Four Great Errors", 3, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:

{{Quotation|Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty &amp;ndash; could be judged and punished: consequently, &lt;u&gt;every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness&lt;/u&gt; (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).&lt;ref&gt;There, sect. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly in ''The Antichrist'': "the will no longer &amp;laquo;acts,&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;moves&amp;raquo;...", "the term no longer denotes any power".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken. The latter is a mistranslation by Mencken (in original: ''kein Vermögen mehr verstanden werden darf'').&lt;/ref&gt; This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.&lt;ref name="WTP"/&gt;

==Nietzsche's conclusions==

===About man and freedom===
In ''The Antichrist'' Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine.&lt;ref name="A14"/&gt; Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 25, tr. H. L. Mencken "Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented  as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, "God" wills the good, and yet evil happens.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book5.html The Gay Science]'', 346, tr. T. Common. "We have become saturated with the conviction (and have grown cold and hard in it) that things are not at all divinely ordered in this world, nor even according to human standards do they go on rationally, mercifully, or justly: we know the fact that the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, and &amp;laquo;inhuman&amp;raquo;, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; So where is this "freedom" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?&lt;ref&gt;In ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I am so wise", 3, tr. Duncan Large he repeated after Stendhal: "God's only excuse is that he doesn't exist." Due to the lack of free will the [[theodicee]] (defence of divine goodness) based on indeterminism becomes void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===About good and evil===
These two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. "[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/works-pub/bge/bgefhm.htm The Aftersong]" in ''Beyond Good and Evil'' or "[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt The Seven Seals]", 4 in ''Zarathustra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a "dualistic fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 17, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' (see the quote above) and later in ''The Antichrist''&lt;ref name="A2638"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26 &amp;amp; 38 about the moral order of the world.&lt;/ref&gt; all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral "task," "purpose" or the "will of God" are considered false. They are a part of the "error of free will"&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; consisting in incomprehension of [[fatalism|fatalism of life]], i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.

===About organized religion===
Religion is a form of controlling people:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 38. "We know, our conscience now knows &amp;ndash; just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing, &amp;ndash; the concepts &amp;laquo;the other world,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the last judgment,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the immortality of the soul,&amp;raquo; the &amp;laquo;soul&amp;raquo; itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master..."&lt;/ref&gt; one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term "freedom," very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means "power."&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; Religion is by no means more "fulfilling the will of God" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).

A priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's "salvation," but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The &amp;laquo;Improvers&amp;raquo; of Mankind", tr. W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche goes on to analysing the [[Bible]] philologically and to guesses about the person of [[Jesus]]. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in ''The Antichrist'' Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.

The very "freedom of will" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking &amp;ndash; and nothing more.&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.&lt;ref name="A2638"/&gt;

===About death of God and nihilism===
The downfall of Christian values is not an effect &amp;ndash; as it has been presented hitherto &amp;ndash; of human free will. The supreme values (especially formerly common in European culture) overthrow each other themselves&lt;ref name="gmfall"&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm On the Genealogy of Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010153350/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm |date=2014-10-10 }}'', treatise III, 27, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; due to inner contradictions&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Nietzsche often quotes, as children of Christianity, honest research (as willing the truth), as well as democratism (as derived from the belief in equality of souls before God, that is: the moral law, and unbelief in a "higher man", so essentially from pacifistic and equalistic tendencies), freedom of press (or speech in general) and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-matching the nature.

{{Quotation|All great things destroy themselves by an act of self-cancellation. That's what the law of life wills, that law of the necessary "self-overcoming" in the essence of life &amp;ndash; eventually the call always goes out to the lawmaker himself, "''patere legem, quam ipse tulisti''" [submit to the law which you yourself have established]. That’s the way Christianity was destroyed as dogma by its own morality; that’s the way Christendom as morality must now also be destroyed. We stand on the threshold of this event.&lt;ref name="gmfall"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1292">The '''Functional Approach''' is considered to be the second paradigm of psychology. This idea focuses on the function of the mental processes which involves consciousnesses. (Gordon, 1995) This approach was developed by William James in 1890. James was the first American Psychologist and wrote the first general textbook regarding psychology.  In this approach he reasoned that the mental act of consciousness must be an important biological function (Schacter et al., 2011) He also noted that it was a psychologist's job to understand these functions so they can discover how the mental process operates. This idea was an alternative approach to the structuralism, which was the first paradigm(Gordon, 1995). 

In second language acquisition (SLA) functional approaches are of similarities with Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG). Focus is on the use of language in real situations (performance), as well as underlying knowledge (competence).

'''Functional psychology''' or '''functionalism''' refers to a psychological philosophy that considers mental life and behaviour in terms of active adaptation to the person's environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gary R. VandenBos, ed., ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'' (2006). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it provides the general basis for developing psychological theories not readily testable by controlled experiments or [[applied psychology]].

Functionalism arose in the U.S. in the late 19th century as an alternative to [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="EBO functionalism"&gt;"functionalism." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222123/functionalism Encyclopædia Britannica Online]. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While functionalism never became a formal school, it built on structuralism's concern for the anatomy of the mind and led to greater concern over the functions of the mind, and later to [[behaviourism]].&lt;ref name="EBO functionalism"/&gt;

==History==
{{original research|date=July 2012}}
{{see also|History of psychology#Early American Psychology}}
Functionalism &lt;ref name="termfunctionalism"&gt; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/ Functionalism]. "Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt; was a philosophy opposing the prevailing [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]] of psychology of the late 19th century. [[Edward Titchener]], the main structuralist, gave psychology its first definition as a science of the study of mental experience, of [[consciousness]], to be studied by trained [[introspection]].

[[William James]] is considered to be the founder of functional psychology. But he would not consider himself as a functionalist, nor did he truly like the way science divided itself into schools. [[John Dewey]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Harvey A. Carr]], and especially [[James Rowland Angell]] were the main proponents of functionalism at the [[University of Chicago]]. Another group at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], including notably [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], and [[Robert S. Woodworth]], were also considered functionalists and shared some of the opinions of Chicago's professors. [[Egon Brunswik]] represents a more recent, but Continental, version. The functionalists retained an emphasis on conscious experience.

[[Behaviourist]]s also rejected the method of introspection but criticized functionalism because it was not based on controlled experiments and its theories provided little predictive ability.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[B.F. Skinner]] was a developer of behaviourism. He did not think that considering how the mind affects behaviour was worthwhile, for he considered behaviour simply as a learned response to an external stimulus. Yet, such behaviourist concepts tend to deny the human capacity for random, unpredictable, sentient decision-making, further blocking the functionalist concept that human behaviour is an active process driven by the individual. Perhaps, ''a combination'' of both the functionalist and behaviourist perspectives provides scientists with the most empirical value,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but, even so, it remains philosophically (and physiologically) difficult to integrate the two concepts without raising further questions about human behaviour.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} For instance, consider the interrelationship between three elements: the human environment, the human autonomic nervous system (our fight or flight muscle responses), and the human somatic nervous system (our voluntary muscle control). The behaviourist perspective explains a mixture of both types of muscle behaviour, whereas the functionalist perspective resides mostly in the somatic nervous system. It can be argued that all behavioural origins begin within the nervous system, prompting all scientists of human behaviour to possess basic physiological understandings, something very well understood by the functionalist founder William James.

==Contemporary descendants==
[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the idea that knowledge concerning the function of the psychological phenomena affecting human evolution is necessary for a complete understanding of the human psyche. Even the project of studying the evolutionary [[consciousness#Biological function and evolution|functions of consciousness]] is now an active topic of study. Like evolutionary psychology, James's functionalism was inspired by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L.; Wegner, Daniel &amp; Gilbert, Daniel. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hail and Farewell''' (a translation of ''ave atque vale'', last words of the poem [[Catullus 101]]) is a traditional military event whereby those coming to and departing from an organization are celebrated. This may coincide with a change in command, be scheduled on an annual basis, or be prompted by any momentous organizational change. It is a time to honor those who have departed the unit and thank them for their service. At the same time it is a welcome to those who are joining and introduces them to the special history and traditions of their new organization. This celebration builds organizational camaraderie and [[esprit de corps]]. It supports a sense of continuity through change.

==United States==
For the [[United States Army]], a Hail and Farewell is most often celebrated at a formal [[dining in]] when there is a change in command. This provides the unit with a formal setting in which to welcome the new commander and honor the old commander. Some units may elect a less formal [[Dining Out]] in which family member and other non-military guests are encouraged to take place in the unit change. There are no official requirements outlined by the United States Army to have a Hail and Farewell celebration. It is up to each unit to carry out this tradition as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

The [[United States Navy]], on the other hand, has specified that by custom the ship's officers must give a formal dinner when their new captain arrives. There may also be a formal dinner for the departing captain and these may be combined into one formal Hail and Farewell dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I. Yakubovich. 2016. Sumerograms and Akkadograms in Hittite: Ideograms, Logograms, Allograms, or
Heterograms? ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

'''Higher-order volitions''' (or '''higher-order desire'''), as opposed to action-determining volitions, are [[volition (psychology)|volition]]s about volitions. Higher-order volitions are potentially more often guided by long-term [[conviction]]s and [[reason]]ing.

A first-order volition is a desire about anything else, such as to own a new car, to meet the pope, or to drink alcohol.  Second-order volition are desires about desires, or to desire to change the process, the how, of desiring.     Examples would be {{cl-span|to desire to want to own|date=June 2015}} a new car;  meeting the pope; or to desire to quit drinking alcohol permanently. A higher-order volition can go unfulfilled due to uncontrolled lower-order volitions.

An example for a failure to follow higher-order volitions is the drug addict who takes drugs even though he would like to quit taking drugs. According to [[Harry Frankfurt]] the drug addict has established [[free will]], in respect to that single aspect, when his higher-order volition to stop wanting drugs determines the precedence of his changing, action determining desires either to take drugs or not to take drugs.

==Synopsis==

The report is believed to be the first comparative international analysis of the human rights of intersex people.&lt;ref name="oii-au" /&gt; It found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

Ghattas states:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

Ghattas found that:&lt;ref name="oii-au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/24360/human-rights-between-the-sexes-a-study/|title=Human rights between the sexes, a study|work=oii.org.au|publisher=[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/nano/medizin/173068/index.html|language=de|title=Nicht Mann, niche Frau.

*Genital "normalization" surgeries are widespread: "Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order. Therefore, genital surgery is performed from infancy to adolescence and adulthood in all examined countries."
*Gonadal tissue is removed in most countries, between childhood and adolescence. Hormone treatments are administered.
*There is minimal aftercare.
*Birth registrations, with a sex assignment, is required in most countries, within 4 weeks of birth.
*Intersex is treated as a taboo subject in all countries studied. Intersex people experience prejudice, often due to gender non-conforming behaviour and appearance.
*Human rights-based activism is only recently established, and the number of NGOs small and volunteer-based.

{{quotation|Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order.}}

Ghattas makes five conclusions for human rights organisations:
#Raise awareness of the existence of intersex individuals.
#Increase visibility of intersex individuals and life situations.
#Encourage intersex people to self-organise and voice needs.
#Promote collaboration with NGOs.
#Take account of the needs of intersex people in all areas of human rights work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1560">The '''ideosphere''', much like the [[noosphere]], is the realm of [[meme]]tic [[evolution]], just like the [[biosphere]] is the realm of biological evolution. It is the "place" where thoughts, theories and ideas are thought to be created, evaluated and evolved. The health of an ideosphere can be measured by its memetic diversity.

The ideosphere is not considered to be a physical place by most people. It is instead "inside the minds" of all the humans in the world. It is also, sometimes, believed that the [[Internet]], books and other media could be considered to be part of the ideosphere. Alas, as such media are not aware, it cannot process the thoughts it contains.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] claims&lt;ref&gt;[http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/1998/vol2/lynch_a.html#11 Lynch's claims]&lt;/ref&gt; to have co-invented this word with [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the mid-1980s.

According to philosopher Yasuhiko Kimura, the ideosphere is in the form of a "concentric ideosphere" where ideas are generated by a few people with others merely perceiving and accepting these ideas from these "external authorities." He advocates an "omnicentric ideosphere" where all individuals create new ideas and interact as self-authorities.

'''In-group favoritism''', sometimes known as '''in-group–out-group bias''', '''in-group bias''', or '''intergroup bias''', is a pattern of favoring members of one's [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. (2010). ''Social psychology''. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Taylor|first= Donald M.|last2= Doria|first2= Janet R.|date= April 1981|title= Self-serving and group-serving bias in attribution|url= |journal= [[Journal of Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 113|issue= 2|pages= 201–211|issn= 0022-4545|doi=10.1080/00224545.1981.9924371}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This interaction has been researched by many [[psychologist]]s and linked to many theories related to [[group conflict]] and [[prejudice]]. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a [[social psychology]] standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efferson|first=Charles|last2=Lalive|first2=Rafael|last3=Fehr|first3=Ernst|date=2008-09-26|title=The Coevolution of Cultural Groups and Ingroup Favoritism|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1844|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5897|pages=1844–1849|doi=10.1126/science.1155805|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18818361|bibcode=2008Sci...321.1844E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Feng|last2=Tarnita|first2=Corina E.|last3=Christakis|first3=Nicholas A.|last4=Wang|first4=Long|last5=Rand|first5=David G.|last6=Nowak|first6=Martin A.|date=2012-06-21|title=Evolution of in-group favoritism|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00460|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=2|pages=460|doi=10.1038/srep00460|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3380441|pmid=22724059|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.460F}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behaviour, increasing covariation. This then incentivises in-group bias.

Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are [[realistic conflict theory]] and [[social identity theory]]. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for [[Social identity theory#Positive distinctiveness|positively distinct]] social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.

==Origins of the research tradition==

In 1906, the sociologist [[William Graham Sumner|William Sumner]] posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how "each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, William Graham. (1906). ''Folkways: A Study of the Social Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. Boston, MA: Ginn.&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen on the group level with ingroup–outgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, [[ethnic group]]s, or nations, it is referred to as [[ethnocentrism]].

==Explanations==

===Competition===
Realistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif's [[Robbers Cave experiment|Robbers Cave Experiment]] is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel.

The boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sherif, M.; Harvey, O.J.; White, B.J.; Hood, W. &amp; Sherif, C.W. (1961). ''Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment''. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups.

Sherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arises when groups compete for limited resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, he also theorised that [[Group conflict|inter-group frictions]] could be reduced and positive relations created,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but only in the presence of an all-encompassing goal which could only be achieved with the two groups cooperation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aronson" /&gt;

===Self-esteem===
According to [[social identity theory]], one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve [[self-esteem]]. The desire to view one's self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one's own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social categorization and similarity in intergroup behaviour|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420030103/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date = 1973-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 27–52|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420030103|first = Michael|last = Billig|first2 = Henri|last2 = Tajfel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by [[Henri Tajfel]], a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created what are now known as minimal groups (see [[minimal group paradigm]]), which occur when "complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable". In Tajfel's studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that—regardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which "style" they like better—participants almost always "liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities". By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;

[[Robert Cialdini]] and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cialdini|first= Robert B.|last2= Borden|first2= Richard J.|last3= Thorne|first3= Avril|last4= Walker|first4= Marcus Randall|last5= Freeman|first5= Stephen|last6= Sloan|first6= Lloyd Reynolds|date= 1974|title= Basking in Reflected Glory: Three (Football) Field Studies|url= |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 366–375|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.3.366 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In another set of studies, done in the 1980s by [[Jennifer Crocker]] and colleagues, self-esteem was studied using minimal group processes in which it was shown that individuals with high self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept exhibit greater ingroup biases than people with low self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept.&lt;ref name=crocker1987&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crocker|first= Jennifer|last2= Thompson|first2= Leigh L.|last3= McGraw|first3= Kathleen M.|last4= Ingerman|first4= Cindy|date= May 1987|title= Downward Comparison, Prejudice, and Evaluations of Others: Effects of Self-Esteem and Threat|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 52|issue= 5|pages= 907–916|issn= 0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.5.907}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Abrams|first= Dominic|last2= Hogg|first2= Michael A.|date= 1988|title= Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination|url= |journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 317–334|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420180403}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem have a higher prejudice to both in-group and out-group members.&lt;ref name=crocker1987 /&gt; Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed a greater prejudice than did lower self-esteem groups.&lt;ref name="Sachdev, I. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sachdev|first= Itesh|last2= Bourhis|first2= Richard Y.|date= September 1987|title= Status differentials and intergroup behaviour|url= |journal= European Journal of Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 17|issue= 3|pages= 277–293|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420170304}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (global personal self-esteem rather than specific social self-esteem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rubin|first= Mark|last2= Hewstone|first2= Miles|date= February 1998|title= Social Identity Theory's Self-Esteem Hypothesis: A Review and Some Suggestions for Clarification|url= |journal= [[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]|publisher= |volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 40–62|doi= 10.1207/s15327957pspr0201_3|pmid=15647150}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological basis as an effect of oxytocin ===
{{Main|Oxytocin}}
In a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by [[Carsten De Dreu]], the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics - categorised as 'in-group' members - promoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin modulates cooperation within and competition between groups: An integrative review and research agenda|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=61|issue=3|pages=419–428|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.12.009|issn=0018-506X|last1=De Dreu|first1=Carsten K.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odd of survival for members of said group.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012" /&gt;

Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and [[empathy]] found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression.&lt;ref name="pmid23246533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheng F, Liu Y, Zhou B, Zhou W, Han S | title = Oxytocin modulates the racial bias in neural responses to others' suffering | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 380–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23246533 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.11.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain.

Oxytocin has also been implicated in [[Lie|lying]] when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members.  In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of [[dishonesty]] in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalvi S, De Dreu CK | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 15 | pages = 5503–7 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24706799 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | pmc=3992689| bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.5503S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group.

As noted in two recent theoretical reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|last2=Terry|first2=Deborah J.|last3=White|first3=Katherine M.|date=1995-01-01|title=A Tale of Two Theories: A Critical Comparison of Identity Theory with Social Identity Theory|jstor=2787127|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=58|issue=4|pages=255–269|doi=10.2307/2787127}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|date=1974-04-01|title=Social identity and intergroup behaviour|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/13/2/65|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1177/053901847401300204|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension, self-categorization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Group Processes: Theory and Research, Vol.2|last=Turner|first=John C.|publisher=JAI|year=1985|isbn=|location=Greenwichm, CT|pages=77–122|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g. a sex, class, team) two processes come into play : (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences.

More specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group-related or personal characteristics influence a person's feelings and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations|last=Tajfel, Henri, John C. Turner|publisher=Brooks-Cole|year=1979|isbn=|location=Brooks-Cole|pages=33–47|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviours are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behaviour through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behaviour if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviourally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people's behaviour and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms.

On the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in the role that the person places him/herself in. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner  for the sake of filling in roles in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality, Roles, and Social Behavior|author1=Stryker, Sheldon |author2=Richard T. Serpe|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1982|isbn=|location=New York|pages=188–218|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized or facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one's identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them.

Identity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly|author1=Nuttbrock, Larry |author2=Patricia Freudiger|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=146–157|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that doesn't work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly 48|last=Callero|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=203–215|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she won't care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies.

Because people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Journal of Psychology 50|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=16–29|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last=Larson, J. R., Jr., Foster-Fishman, P. G., &amp; Keys, C. B.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=446–461|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.

== Evolution of in-groups ==

=== Formation of cultural groups ===
Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of [[cultural group]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in-group favoritism.

Efferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilising a series of [[coordination game]]s to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behaviour and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favouritism occurred in ensuing social interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Participants were first divided into one of several populations of 10 people, and then further divided into subpopulations of 5. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of 2 choices, behaviour A or behaviour B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the 2nd group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis-coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched.

The experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivised to develop a sense of expected behaviours in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviours were not in-line with [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behaviour with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, [[covariation]] (of marker and behaviour) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same-shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favouritism.

Their study supported the thesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioural traits being advantageous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilisations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioural norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==

=== Automatic bias for own gender ===
{{harvtxt|Rudman|Goodwin|2004}} conducted research on [[gender bias]] that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at [[Purdue]] and [[Rutgers]] participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |last1=Rudman |first1=Laurie A. |last2=Goodwin |first2=Stephanie A. |year=2004 |title=Gender differences in automatic in-group bias: Why do women like women more than men like men? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=494–509 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.4.494 |issue=4 |pmid=15491274 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718210210/http://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |df=mdy|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt; than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt;

=== Competition ===
Using a publics-goods game, Van Gugt, De Cremer, and P. Janssen (2016) found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women's contributions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Van Vugt, M., De Cremer, D., P. Janssen, D. (2016) Gender Differences in Cooperation and Competition Psychological Science, Vol 18, Issue 1, pp. 19 – 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity-based favoritism ===
Fershtman and Gneezy (2001) found that men showed in-group biases in a [[Trust game|"trust" game]] based on ethnicity whereas this tendency was not present in women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fershtman|first=Chaim|last2=Gneezy|first2=Uri|date=2001-02-01|title=Discrimination in a Segmented Society: An Experimental Approach|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/116/1/351/1939071/Discrimination-in-a-Segmented-Society-An|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=116|issue=1|pages=351–377|doi=10.1162/003355301556338|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study aim to identify [[ethnic discrimination]] in [[Israelis|Israeli Jewish]] society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participants name was typically ethnically Eastern or [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]]. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]]) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back.

The experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This result may seem counter-intuitive as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male, thus we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalised, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia, "Positive Effects of the Multiple Negative: Explaining the Success of Black Professional Women," American Journal of Sociology, LXXVIII (1993), 150-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental age ===

Fehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach (2008), in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favouritism from ages 3–8 whereas girls did not display such tendencies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Bernhard|first2=Helen|last3=Rockenbach|first3=Bettina|title=Egalitarianism in young children|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature07155|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7208|pages=1079–1083|doi=10.1038/nature07155|year=2008|bibcode=2008Natur.454.1079F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment involved usage of an "envy game", a modified version of the [[dictator game]]. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

They theorised that [[parochialism]] and favouring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favoured a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Real-world examples ==

=== 2008 US Presidential elections ===
A study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rand|first=David G.|last2=Pfeiffer|first2=Thomas|last3=Dreber|first3=Anna|last4=Sheketoff|first4=Rachel W.|last5=Wernerfelt|first5=Nils C.|last6=Benkler|first6=Yochai|date=2009-04-14|title=Dynamic remodeling of in-group bias during the 2008 presidential election|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/15/6187|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=15|pages=6187–6191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811552106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2664153|pmid=19332775|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.6187R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study carried out on 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics [[dictator game]]. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous apart from which candidate they supported in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic Primaries]].

Data was collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18th (after [[Hillary Clinton]]'s concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14th, before the [[Democratic National Convention]] on the 25th; and September 2 to 5th, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favouritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias however was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favouritism throughout.

The experiment showed how group identities were flexible and could change over time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Researchers theorised that in-group bias was strong in June as the competition to be the Democratic representative in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Only in September did the in-group favouritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present.

== Versus out-group negativity ==
{{Main|Group conflict}}
Social psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). "An integrative theory of intergroup conflict". In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 33–47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity.&lt;ref name="Bourhis &amp; Gagnon (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R.

This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to [[Racism|racial discrimination]], the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial [[discrimination]] than does [[Race (human classification)|race]] itself.

Research finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jeremy |last=West |date=February 2018 |title=Racial Bias in Police Investigations |work=Working Paper |url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwest1/articles/West_RacialBiasPolice.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Briggs |last=Depew |first2=Ozkan |last2=Eren |first3=Naci |last3=Mocan |year=2017 |title=Judges, Juveniles, and In-Group Bias |journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=209–239 |doi=10.1086/693822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological relationship ===
Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members.  Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict.&lt;ref name="pmid23144787"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin motivates non-cooperation in intergroup conflict to protect vulnerable in-group members|journal=PLoS One|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e46751|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046751|pmc=3492361|pmid=23144787|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2012PLoSO...746751D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The herding hormone: oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity|journal=Psychological Science|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1288–92|doi=10.1177/0956797612446026|pmid=22991128|vauthors=Stallen M, De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Smidts A, Sanfey AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.

Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners.&lt;ref name="pmid21220339"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2011|title=Oxytocin promotes human ethnocentrism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=4|pages=1262–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.1015316108|pmc=3029708|pmid=21220339|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Shalvi S, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1262D}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin.&lt;ref name="pmid25140135"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2014|title=Oxytocin increases liking for a country's people and national flag but not for other cultural symbols or consumer products|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=|pages=266|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00266|pmc=4122242|pmid=25140135|vauthors=Ma X, Luo L, Geng Y, Zhao W, Zhang Q, Kendrick KM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in [[xenophobic]] tendencies secondary to this effect.  Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific "home" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

==In-group derogation==
Cross-cultural studies have found that in-group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one's own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to psychology professor Christine Ma-Kellams et al. (2011), [[system justification theory]] seeks to explain why "minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group". They said their research into in-group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt;

Ma-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as [[East Asian]] cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; [[Social identity theory]]{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and [[Freudian]] theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative [[self-image]], which they believe is then extended to the group.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that "ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians" as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally-ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures' in-group derogation due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.&lt;ref name=MaKellams&gt;{{Cite journal|title = I Am Against Us?

'''Inhibition theory''' is based on the basic assumption that during the performance of any mental task requiring a minimum of mental effort, the subject actually goes through a series of alternating latent states of distraction (non-work 0) and attention (work 1) which cannot be observed and are completely imperceptible to the subject. 

Additionally, the concept of inhibition or [[reactive inhibition]] which is also latent, is introduced. The assumption is made that during states of attention inhibition linearly increases with a slope ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and during states of distraction inhibition linearly decreases with a slope ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.According to this view the distraction states can be considered a sort of recovery state.

It is further assumed, that when the inhibition increases during a state of attention, depending on the amount of increase, the inclination to switch to a distraction state also increases.  When inhibition decreases during a state of distraction, depending on the amount of decrease, the inclination to switch to an attention state increases. The inclination to switch from one state to the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate, making the whole process of alternating distraction times and attention times a [[stochastic process]].

== Theory ==

A non-negative continuous random variable ''T''  represents the time until an event will take place.  The hazard rate ''λ''(''t'') for that random variable is defined to be the limiting value of the probability that the event will occur in a small interval [''t'',''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''t'']; given the event has not occurred before time ''t'', divided by Δ''t''. Formally, the hazard rate is defined by the following limit: 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Pr(t \le T &lt; t + \Delta t  \mid  T \ge t)}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

The hazard rate ''λ''(''t'') can also be written in terms of the density function or [[probability density function]] ''f''(''t'') and the distribution function or [[cumulative distribution function]] ''F''(''t''): 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} &lt;/math&gt;

The transition rates ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), from state 1 to state 0, and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), from state 0 to state 1, depend on inhibition Y(''t''): ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')   = ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y(''t'')) and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')  = ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(Y(''t'')), where ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-decreasing function and ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-increasing function. Note, that ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are dependent on ''Y'', whereas ''Y'' is dependent on ''T''. Specification of the functions ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the various inhibition models. 

What can be observed in the test are the actual reaction times. A reaction time is the sum of a series of alternating distraction times and attention times, which cannot be observed. It is, nevertheless, possible to estimate from the observable reaction times some properties of the latent process of distraction times and attention times, i.e., the average distraction time, the average attention time, and the ratio a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to be able to simulate the consecutive reaction times, inhibition theory has been specified into various inhibition models. 

One is the so-called beta inhibition model. In the beta-inhibition model, it is assumed that the inhibition Y(''t'') oscillates between two boundaries which are 0 and ''M'' (''M'' for Maximum), where ''M'' is positive. In this model ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_1 (y) = \frac{c_1 M}{M - y}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_0 (y) = \frac{c_0}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

both with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. Note that, according to the first assumption, as ''y'' goes to ''M'' (during an interval), ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of rest before the inhibition can reach ''M''. According to the second assumption, as y goes to zero (during a distraction), ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of work before the inhibition can reach zero. For a work interval starting at ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with inhibition level ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) the transition rate at time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' is given by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t). For a non-work interval starting at ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with inhibition level ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) the transition rate is given by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''t''). Therefore 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 (t) = \frac{c_1 M}{M - (y_0 + a_1 t)}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 (t) = \frac{c_0}{y_0 - a_0 t}&lt;/math&gt;

The model has ''Y'' fluctuating in the interval between 0 and ''M''. The stationary distribution of ''Y''/''M'' in this model is a beta distribution (the beta inhibition model). 

The total real working time until the conclusion of the task (or the task unit in case of a repetition of equivalent unit tasks), for example, in the Attention Concentration Test, is referred to as ''A''. The average stationary response time ''E''(''T'') may be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname E(T) = A + \frac{a_1}{a_0} A.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''M'' goes to infinity ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This model is known as the gamma − or Poisson inhibition − model (see Smit and van der Ven, 1995).

== Application ==

Inhibition theory has especially been developed to account for short-term oscillation as well as the long-term trend in the reaction time curves obtained in continuous response tasks such as the Attention Concentration Test (ACT). The ACT typically consists of an overlearned prolonged work task in which each response elicits the next. Several authors, among them Binet (1900), stressed the importance of the fluctuation in the reaction times suggesting the [[mean absolute deviation|mean deviation]] as a measure of performance. 

In this connection it is also worthwhile to mention a study by Hylan (1898). In his experiment B, he used, a 27 single digits addition task indicating the importance of the fluctuation of reaction times and was the first to report gradually increasing (marginally decreasing) reaction time curves (Hylan, 1898, page 15, figure 5).

Recently, the inhibition model has been also used to explain the phase durations in [[binocular rivalry]] experiments (van der Ven, Gremmen &amp; Smit, 2005). The model is able to account for the statistical properties of alternating phase durations

&lt;center&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., 
&lt;/center&gt;

representing the amount of time a person perceives the stimulus in one eye ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1j&lt;/sub&gt; and in the other eye ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0j&lt;/sub&gt;.

Firstly, intelligence is considered to be a cognitive process, while personality is recognised as being non-cognitive, and this implies that there is a great distinction between personality and intelligence. However, other psychologists argue that the distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive is vague because almost all personality traits have cognitive attributes, although they are more obvious in some traits than in others. For example, neuroticism is a personality trait, but is also related to rumination and compulsive thinking about possible threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   |last1=Nolan|first1=S. A. |last2= Roberts|first2= J. E.|last3= Gotlib|first3= I. H.|date= 1998|title= Neuroticism and ruminative response style as predictors of change in depressive symptomatology|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=22|pages=445–455|doi=10.1023/a:1018769531641}}&lt;/ref&gt; while agreeableness is associated with understanding and considering the mental state of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nettle|first1= D. |last2= Liddle |first2=B.|date=2008 |title=Agreeableness is related to social-cognitive, but not social-perceptual, theory of mind|journal=European Journal of Personality |volume= 22|pages= 323–335 |doi=10.1002/per.672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, different methods are generally used to assess intelligence and personality. Intelligence is normally measured by means of ability tests, whereas personality is usually assessed by means of questionnaires. Furthermore, different typical measurements lead to another conceptual distinction, which is that intelligence is considered to indicate individuals’ ''maximal performance'', while personality is believed to reflect their ''typical behaviour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronbach|first1= L. J. |date= 1949|title=Essentials of psychological testing }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that multiple methods can be used to assess intelligence and personality; for example, questionnaires that require to be rated by self, peers or observers can also be used to measure individuals’ mental ability, although these kinds of measurement may lack accuracy. Therefore, different typical methods cannot prove that the relationship between intelligence and personality is a meaningless one. In addition, since individuals’ ability can also affect their typical behaviour, IQ can predict outcomes related to aspects such as performance at work, academic achievement, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Sternberg |first1=R. J.|last2= Grigorenko |first2= E.

An increasing number of studies have recently explored the relationship between intelligence and the Big Five personality traits.

==Openness/Intellect==
[[Openness to experience|Openness]] shows the strongest positive relationship with ''g'' among the Big Five personality traits, ranging from r=.06 to r=.42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ashton |first1=M.

Therefore, openness shows a significant moderate association with [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|crystallized intelligence]] (r=.30), but a non-significant low association with [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]] (r=.08),&lt;ref name="Ackerman1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ackerman|first1=P. L. |last2= Heggestad|first2=E.

Some psychologists have recently pointed out that previous instruments used to measure openness actually assessed two distinctive aspects. The first is intellect, which reflects intellectual engagement and perceived intelligence and is marked by ideas, while the second is emotion, which reflects the artistic and contemplative qualities related to being engaged in sensation and perception and is marked by fantasy, aesthetics, feelings and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= DeYoung|first1=C.

==Conscientiousness==
The association between [[conscientiousness]] and intelligence is complex and uncertain. Individuals with a lower level of intelligence are always assumed to tend to behave in an orderly fashion and do extra work, which is related to being conscientious, in order to compensate for their lower level of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Chamorro-Premuzic2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chamorro-Premuzic|first1=T.|last2=Moutafi|first2=J.|last3=Furnham|first3=A.|date= 2005|title=The relationship between personality traits, subjectively-assessed and fluid intelligence.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=38|issue=7 |pages=1517–1528|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although intelligence has been observed to be negatively correlated with conscientiousness in some studies,&lt;ref name=" Poropat2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamorro-Premuzic2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moutafi|first1=J.|last2=Furnham|first2=A.|last3=Crump|first3=J.|date= 2003|title=Demographic and personality predictors of intelligence: A study using the NEO Personality Inventory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. |journal=European Journal of Personality|volume=17|pages=79–94|doi=10.1002/per.471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judge2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Judge|first1=T.

Furthermore, some interaction has been found between conscientiousness and intelligence. Conscientiousness has been found to be a stronger predictor of safety behaviour in individuals with a low level of intelligence than in those with a high level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Postlethwaite|first1= B.|last2= Robbins|first2=S.|last3= Rickerson|first3=  J.|last4=McKinniss|first4= T.|date=2009|title= The moderation of conscientiousness by cognitive ability when predicting workplace safety behaviour.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=  47 |pages= 711–716|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction may also be found in educational and occupational settings in future studies. Therefore, relatively speaking, an increase in either conscientiousness or intelligence may compensate for a deficiency in the other.

==Extraversion==
The results of a meta-analysis research conducted in 1997, which consisted of 35 studies, indicated that there is a very small, but statistically significant positive correlation between [[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]]  and ''g'' (r=.08).&lt;ref name="Ackerman1997"/&gt; Another recent meta-analysis of extraversion, which comprised 50 new studies, reported a similar correlation (r=.05).&lt;ref name="Wolf2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1= M. B. |last2=Ackerman|first2=P. L.|date= 2005|title=Extraversion and intelligence: A meta-analytic investigation. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=39 |pages=531–542 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some moderating variables in the relationship between extraversion and ''g'' including differences in the assessment instruments and samples’ age and sensory stimulation; for example, no meaningful correlation was found between extraversion and intelligence in the samples of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawlings |first1=D. |last2=Skok|first2=M.|date=1993|title= Extraversion, venturesomeness and intelligence in children.|journal= Personality and Individual Differences|volume=15|pages=389–396|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(93)90066-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Saklofske|first1=D.

C.|last2=Rock|first2=A.|date=2004|title=Personality and information processing speed: Independent influences on intelligent performance. |journal=Intelligence|volume=32|issue=1|pages=33–46|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2003.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas introverts performed best in silence. This result is consistent with that of Revelle et al. (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Revelle|first1=W.|last2=Amaral|first2=P.|last3=Turriff |first3=S. |date= 1976|title= Introversion/extraversion, time stress, and caffeine|journal=Science |volume= 192 |pages= 149–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1257762}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, different measures and different sub-traits of extraversion have been found to cause significantly different correlations.&lt;ref name="Wolf2005"/&gt;

==Neuroticism==
[[Neuroticism]] has been found to have a reliable negative association with ''g''(r=-.33).&lt;ref name="Ackerman1997"/&gt; However, other researchers have recently reported a lower coefficient of .09 for general mental ability and emotional stability.&lt;ref name="Judge2007"/&gt; Although these studies have some differences, they all indicate that intelligence increases with a decrease in negative emotion.

One of the reasons for this negative correlation is [[Test anxiety]], which refers to the psychological distress experienced by individuals prior to, or during, an evaluative situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman |first1=M. |last2=Spielberger |first2= C. D. |title=Emotions and anxiety: New concepts, methods, and applications |pages=57–81|publisher=New York:Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely associated with neuroticism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chamorro - Premuzic|first1=T.|last2=Ahmetoglu|first2= G.|last3= Furnham |first3= A. |date= 2008|title= Little more than personality:Trait determinants of test anxiety . |journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=18 |pages= 258–263 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a negative influence on individuals’performance in an intelligence test (r=-.23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wicherts|first1=J. M.|last2=Scholten|first2=A.|date=2010|title=Test anxiety and the validity of cognitive tests: A confirmatory factor analysis perspective and some empirical findings.|journal=Intelligence|volume=38 |pages=169–178|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2009.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that all the aforementioned evidence indicates that neuroticism is related to test performance rather than true intelligence. However, according to the results of a longitudinal study recently conducted by Gow et al., (2005), neuroticism influences an age-related decline in intelligence and there is a small negative correlation between neuroticism and a change in the level of IQ (r=-.18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gow|first1=A. J.|last2=Whiteman|first2= M. C.|last3=Pattie|first3= A.|last4= Deary |first4=I. J. |date=2005|title= The personality–intelligence interface: Insights from an ageing cohort. |journal=  Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|pages=751–761 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is still debatable if neuroticism reduces general intelligence, this study provided some valuable evidence and a direction for research. 
In addition, some interaction between intelligence and neuroticism has been found. Individuals with a high level of neuroticism demonstrated a poor performance, health, and adjustment only if they had a low level of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leikas|first1=S.|last2=M¨akinen|first2=S.|last3=L¨ onnqvist|first3=J.E.|last4=Verkasalo|first4= M. |date=2009|title=Cognitive ability×Emotional stability interactions on adjustment.|journal=European Journal of Personality|volume=23|pages=329–342|doi=10.1002/per.711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, intelligence may act as a buffer and compensate neuroticism in individuals.

==Agreeableness==
No significant association between agreeableness and ''g'' has been found in previous research.&lt;ref name="Ackerman1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judge2007"/&gt; However, some components of agreeableness have been found to be related to intelligence. For example, aggression is negatively associated with intelligence (r is around -.20) &lt;ref name="Ackerman1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|issue=|last1=DeYoung|first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12150">'''Invisible support''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] term used to describe a type of [[social support]] in which supportive exchanges are not visible to recipients. There are two possible situations that can describe acts of invisible support. The first possibility entails a situation where ''recipients are completely unaware of the supportive transaction between themselves and support-givers''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolger, Zuckerman, &amp; Kessler|first=|year=2000|title=Invisible Support and Adjustment to Stress|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79 |issue=6|pages=953–961|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.953|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.333}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a spouse may choose to spontaneously take care of housework without mentioning it to the other couple-member. Invisible support also occurs when ''recipients are aware of an act that takes place but do not interpret the act as a supportive exchange''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this case, a friend or family member may subtly provide advice in an indirect manner as a means to preserve the recipient's self-esteem or to defer his or her attention from a stressful situation. Invisible support can be viewed on both ends of an exchange, in which the recipient is unaware of the support received and the provider enacts support in a skillful, subtle way.

== Background ==
It is well known that perceptions of social support availability predict better adjustment to stressful life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=House, Landis, &amp; Umberson|first=|year=1988|title=Social relationships and health|url=|journal=Science|volume=241 |issue=4865|pages=540–545|via=|doi=10.1126/science.3399889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=|year=1992|title=Stress, social support, and disorder|url=|journal=The Meaning and Measurement of Social Support|volume=|pages=109–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Close personal relationships and health outcomes: A key to the role of social support.|last=Gurung, R., Sarason, B., &amp; Sarason, I|first=|publisher=Handbook of personal relationships: theory, research and interventions (2nd ed)|year=1997|isbn=|location=Chichester, UK|pages=547–73|quote=|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that the perception of support availability is inherently comforting, and can serve as a psychological safety-net that motivates self-reliant [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] efforts in the face of [[Stress (psychology)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wethington, E., &amp; Kessler, R. C.|first=|year=1986|title=Perceived support, received support, and adjustment to stressful life events|url=|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=27|issue=1|pages=78–89|via=|doi=10.2307/2136504|pmid=3711634|jstor=2136504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the perception of support availability is associated with better adjustment, the knowledge that one has been the recipient of specific supportive acts has often been unhelpful to effectively reduce stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolger, N., Foster, M., Vinokur, A. D., &amp; Ng, R.|first=|year=1996|title=Close relationships and adjustments to a life crisis: The case of breast cancer|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70 |issue=2|pages=283–294|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.2.283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieberman, M.

D., Nadler, A., &amp; Whitcher-Alagna, S.|first=|year=1982|title=Recipient reactions to aid|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=91 |issue=1|pages=27–54|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.91.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; People's well-intentioned support attempts may also be miscarried, and their efforts could either fail or even worsen the situation for a person under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coyne, J. C., Wortman, C. B., &amp; Lehman, D. R.|first=|year=1988|title=The other side of support: Emotional over-involvement and miscarried helping.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since supportive acts benefit recipients but their actual knowledge of receiving support is sometimes harmful, it has been theorized that the most effective support exchange would involve one in which the provider reports giving support but the recipient does not notice that support has occurred. From a cost-benefit point of view, invisible support would be optimal for the recipient because the benefits of provision are accrued while the costs of receipt are avoided.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using the same idea, it also implies that the least effective type of support would be one in which the provider does not report providing support but the recipient reports receiving it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first investigation of invisible support involved a couples study in which one member was preparing for the New York State Bar Exam. Support receipt and provision were measured by having both couple members complete daily diary entries. Over the course of one month, stressed individuals who reported low frequency of received support (but whose partner ranked his or her own actions as highly supportive) rated themselves low on anxiety and depression compared to other individuals who reported high frequency of received support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Invisible support compared to visible support ==
A substantial body of work has evidence to suggest that support is most effective when it is invisible or goes unnoticed by recipients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howland, M., &amp; Simpson, J. A.|first=|year=2010|title=Getting in under the radar a dyadic view of invisible support|doi=10.1177/0956797610388817|pmid=21097721|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=12|pages=1878–1885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrout, P.

For example, greater observed support enacted by intimate partners during couples’ support-relevant exchanges have been shown to build feelings of closeness and support, boost positive mood and self-esteem, and foster greater goal achievement and relationship quality across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins, N. L., &amp; Feeney, B. C.|first=|year=2004|title=Working models of attachment shape perceptions of social support: evidence from experimental and observational studies|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=87 |issue=3|pages=363–383|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.363|pmid=15382986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan, K.

To investigate this idea, a recent study in 2013 compared the short-term and long-term effects of visible and invisible support reception during romantic couples’ discussions of each partner’s personal goal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girme, Y. U., Overall, N. C., &amp; Simpson, J. A.|first=|year=2013|title=When visibility matters: short-term versus long-term costs and benefits of visible and invisible support|doi=10.1177/0146167213497802|pmid=23885036|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=39|issue=11|pages=1441–1454|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that either type of support was more beneficial depending on the emotional distress that recipients felt at the time. Visible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) was associated with perceptions of greater support and discussion success for recipients who felt greater distress during the discussion. In contrast, invisible emotional support was not associated with recipients’ post-discussion perceptions of support or discussion success. For long-term support effects, it was found that only invisible emotional support predicted greater goal achievement across the following year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When put together, these findings suggest that visible support and invisible support have unique functions for well-being. When people are under distress, visible support appears to be a short-term remedy to reassure recipients that they are cared for and supported. These benefits are only present when recipients are actually distressed during the time that the supportive act takes place. On the other hand, while invisible support tends to go unnoticed by recipients, it seems to play an integral role in the long-term success of goal-maintenance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Effects on support providers ==
{{primary sources|section|date=November 2016}}
{{see also|social support|Psychology|Stress (psychological)|Coping (psychology)|self-esteem|self-efficacy}}
The effects of invisible support on recipients have been extensively investigated, but the consequences of invisible support on providers are less known. One study in 2016 investigated the benefits and costs of invisible support on couple-members who enacted supportive behaviors by differentiating the processes of invisible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) from processes of invisible instrumental support (providing tangible aid such as sending money or childcare).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=König, C., Stadler, G., Knoll, N., Ochsner, S., Hornung, R., &amp; Scholz, U.|first=|year=2016|title=Invisible Support: Effects on the Provider's Positive and Negative Affect|url=|journal=Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No costs of support-giving were found for providers when they demonstrated acts of invisible emotional support. The effects for invisible instrumental support told a different story, where providers who reported high relationship satisfaction were unaffected, but providers who reported low relationship satisfaction were negatively affected by their acts of invisible instrumental support with an increase in negative mood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These findings suggest that emotional comfort may be a more central function to maintain close relationships than instrumental support. Therefore, providing invisible emotional support may lead to less perceptions of a costly inequity than providing invisible instrumental support on average. However, since invisible instrumental support did not incur costs for providers who reported high relationship satisfaction, it implies that high relationship satisfaction may buffer potential costs that would otherwise be felt by support-providers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The differential results between invisible instrumental and emotional support indicate that a solid distinction between instrumental and emotional social support may be useful to take into account when investigating effects of invisible support as a whole.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā''''' (in both [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]]) is generally translated as [[compassion]].&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the Sanskrit word, see Monier-Williams (1899), p. 255, entry for "karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā" (retrieved at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0255-karaTa.pdf), where the noun form of the word is defined as "pity, compassion". For the Pali word, see Rhys, Davids &amp;amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 197, entry for "Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā" (retrieved at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), where it is defined as "pity, compassion".  In general, contemporary scholars, translators and interpreters have consistently translated the word as "compassion," not "pity."  This can be seen, for instance, in (listed chronologically) [[A. K. Warder|Warder]] (1970/2004, p. 95), [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu|Ñāṇamoli]] (Buddhaghosa &amp; Ñāṇamoli, 1975/1991, [[Visuddhimagga|Vsm.]] IX.77ff., pp. 306ff.), [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa|Saddhatissa]] (1985/1994, p. 3, [[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 3.39), [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro]] (1994, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), [[Sharon Salzberg|Salzberg]] (1995, pp. 102ff.), [[Rupert Gethin|Gethin]] (1998, p. 187), and [[Bhikkhu Bodhi|Bodhi]] (2000, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 41.7, p. 1325).&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the spiritual path of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

==Buddhism==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is important in all schools of Buddhism.  For [[Theravāda]] Buddhists, dwelling in karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a means for attaining a happy present life and heavenly rebirth.  For [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhists, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a co-requisite for becoming a [[Bodhisattva]].

===Theravada Buddhism===
In Theravāda Buddhism, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the four "divine abodes" (''[[Brahmavihara|brahmavihāra]]''), along with loving kindness ([[Pāli]]: ''[[mettā]]''), sympathetic joy (''[[mudita]]'') and equanimity (''[[upekkha]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp.186-187; and, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, [https://archive.is/20120711002204/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali ''op. cit.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Pali canon]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] recommends cultivating these four virtuous mental states to both [[householder (Buddhism)|householders]] and [[bhikkhu|monastics]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the ''Kālāmā Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), the Buddha speaks of all Noble Disciples (''ariya-[[savaka]]'') developing the brahmaviharas  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html (Thanissaro, 1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When one develops these four states, the Buddha counsels radiating them in all directions, as in the following stock canonical phrase regarding karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā:
{{quote|He keeps pervading the first direction—as well as the second direction, the third, and the fourth—with an awareness imbued with compassion. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with compassion: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.&lt;ref&gt;''Kālāmā Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html Thanissaro (1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }} The "four directions" refer to east, south, west and north.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Such a practice purifies one's mind, avoids evil-induced consequences, leads to happiness in one's present life and, if there is a future [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], it will be in a [[Buddhist cosmology|heavenly realm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html (Thanissaro, 1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }}  In regards to in which heavenly realm a frequent karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā dweller will be reborn, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.125 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html (Thanissaro, 2006)] identifies it as the realm of radiant (''abhassara'') devas, whose lifespans last two eons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] distinguish between karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā and [[mettā]] in the following complementary manner:  Karuna is the desire to remove harm and suffering (''ahita-[[dukkha]]-apanaya-kāmatā'') from others; while mettā is the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness (''hita-[[sukha]]-upanaya-kāmatā'') of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sutta Nipata|Sn]]-[[Atthakatha|A]] 128 (cited by Rhys Davids &amp;amp; Stede, 1921–25, ''op. cit.''); see also, [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm BDEA &amp; BuddhaNet (n.d.).]  Similarly, the post-canonical [[Visuddhimagga]], chapter IX, vv. 105-109, provides further elucidation, such as with a metaphor describing ''mettā'' as a mother's wish for her (healthy) child to grow up and ''karuṇā'' as a mother's wish for her sick child to get well (Buddhaghosa &amp; Nanamoli, 1975/99, pp. 313-4).&lt;/ref&gt;
The "far enemy" of karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is [[cruelty]], a mind-state in obvious opposition. The "near enemy" (quality which superficially resembles karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is  (sentimental) [[pity]]: here too one wants to remove suffering, but for a partly selfish (attached) reason hence not the pure motivation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga'] Section 2.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/dhamma-lists/] &lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}
In the Pali Canon, buddhas are also described as choosing to teach "out of compassion for beings."&lt;ref&gt;In Pali, ''sattesu ... kāruññataṃ paṭicca'', found in [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 3.6 (regarding [[Vipassī Buddha]]), [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 26.21 and SN 6.1 (see, e.g., Bodhi, 2000, pp. 233, 430, ''n''. 362; and Thanissaro, 1997).  It is worthwhile noting as well that several other references in the Pali Canon to the Buddha's acting out of "compassion" are not related directly to ''karuṇā'' but to the synonymous ''anukampā'' (which is also defined as "mercy" in Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-25, p. 34).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana Buddhism===
In Mahāyāna Buddhism, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the two qualities, along with enlightened wisdom ([[Sanskrit]]: ''[[prajña]]''), to be cultivated on the [[bodhisattva]] path.  According to scholar [[Rupert Gethin]], this elevation of karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā to the status of [[prajña]] is one of the distinguishing factors between the Theravāda [[arahant]] ideal and the Mahāyāna bodhisattva ideal:
{{quote|For the Mahāyāna ... the path to arhatship appears tainted with a residual selfishness since it lacks the motivation of the great compassion (''mahākaru{{IAST|ṇ}}ā'') of the bodhisattva, and ultimately the only legitimate way of Buddhist practice is the bodhisattva path.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1999), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the Mahāyāna world, [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Sanskrit; Chinese: [[Guan Yin]]; Japanese: [[Kannon]]; Tibetan: Chenrezig) is a bodhisattva who embodies karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā.

In the Intermediate section of the ''Stages of Meditation'' by [[Kamalaśīla]], he writes:
{{quote|Moved by compassion[karunā], Bodhisattvas take the vow to liberate all sentient beings. Then by overcoming their self-centered outlook, they engage eagerly and continuously in the very difficult practices of accumulating merit and insight. Having entered into this practice, they will certainly complete the collection of merit and insight. Accomplishing the accumulation of merit and insight is like having omniscience itself in the palm of your hand. Therefore, since compassion is the only root of omniscience, you should become familiar with this practice from the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;''Stages of Meditation'' by H.H The Dalai Lama, Root Text by Kamalashila. Snow Lion Publications. Page 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], one of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]'' by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled ''Meditative Concentration'', Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:

{{quote|Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one--the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own.  And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of the Bodhisattva'' by Shantideva.  Shambhala Publications.  Page 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Jainism==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is associated with the Jain practice of compassion.  For instance, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the four reflections of universal friendship &amp;mdash; along with amity (Sanskrit: ''[[Mettā|maitri]]''), appreciation (''pramoda'') and equanimity (''madhyastha'')—used to stop (''[[samvara]]'') the influx of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/9tattva.htm Shah (n.d.).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605003634/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/9tattva.htm |date=2009-06-05 }}  Regarding ''samvara'', see [[Karma_in_Jainism#Release_from_karmas|"Release from karmas"]]. From a comparative religion perspective, cf. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]]; for instance, ''maitri'' is often identified as a Sanskrit correlate of the Pali ''mettā'' (Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-5, p. 540, entry for "Mettā," retrieved at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:177.pali{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a common first name throughout [[India]], used for both genders.

Lithuanian "karūna" means "crown", possible relation of meaning of qualities of crown owners.

[[File:Kees Boeke (1939).jpg|right|thumb]]
'''Cornelis Boeke''' (25 September 1884, [[Alkmaar]] – 3 July 1966, [[Abcoude]]), usually known as '''Kees Boeke''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] reformist [[educator]], [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] and [[pacifist]]. He is best known for his popular essay/book ''[[Cosmic View]]'' (1957) which presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale, and which inspired several films.

Boeke tried to reform education by allowing  the children to contribute their ideas. He called this process [[sociocracy]] and regarded schools as  workshops, with pupils as workers, and teachers as co-workers.  Based on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] ideas, he wanted the  children  to respect  [[democracy]].  In 1926, he founded a school  in [[Bilthoven]], which he led until 1954. As a child, the later Dutch [[Queen Beatrix]]  attended the school.

==Biography==
Kees Boeke grew up in a [[Mennonite]] family in Alkmaar. He studied [[architecture]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]]. As a student, he spent a year in [[England]], where he met the Quakers. He became a Quaker and attended [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]], a college in [[Selly Oak]], [[Birmingham]]. There, he found inspiration in [[Bournville]], the garden village which the [[Cadbury]] family (owners of the chocolate factory) had built for their workers. He met and married Beatrice (Betty) Cadbury. The couple went to [[Syria]] in 1912 as Quaker missionaries. In 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], they returned to England. They became active in peace work, the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] having come into being in 1914 through [[Henry Hodgkin]]. In 1915 Boeke traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]], with whom Hodgkin had been working at the outbreak of war. Boeke began to speak publicly in England: "The Germans are our brothers; God did not create man that he might kill; the war will find its quickest end when all soldiers lay down their weapons." He was deported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and returned to the Netherlands. His family followed; there they lived in Bilthoven, near [[Utrecht]]. Their home soon became a pacifist centre. Later in the Second World War Boeke took part in the underground Dutch resistance movement against the same Germans, he called brothers before. This was, however, in line with his ideas of anti-authority and his disapproval of war and prosecution.

After the First World War, Boeke erected a large conference centre in Bilthoven, which he called "Brotherhood House." The first international peace conference took place there between 4 and 11 October 1919. Present at the conference were [[Leon Revoyne]], [[Mathilda Wrede]], [[Leonard Ragaz]], [[Pierre Ceresole]], as well as Hodgkin and Schultze. Boeke and Ceresole became the secretaries of this movement, which initially called itself "Christian International", later the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]. Together with [[Helene Stöcker]],  and [[Wilfred Wellock]], they founded the [[Service Civil International]] and in 1921 "Paco" (the [[Esperanto]] word for peace), which in 1923 became [[War Resisters' International]] (WRI).

Kees and Betty Boeke considered war to be rooted in the entanglement of the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]]. As Betty was a Cadbury, she inherited large shares in her family's firm. She transferred this money to various charitable organizations such as the Quaker-Help Organisation in Russia in 1920. Later, she gave the shares to a trust for the workers of the Cadbury factory. For a while, the Boekes abstained from using money, so as to avoid contributing to the state — since public funds are also spent on weapons. They never used public transport, nor did they pay postage, tolls, or taxes. As a result, they were imprisoned several times. On one occasion the Dutch tax authorities auctioned off the estate in order to recover taxes. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] was in attendance at the auction, and purchased Kees' favorite violin, only to return it to him on the spot. Boeke supported his family by working in Utrecht in a building association which he had founded; he did not work as an architect (which was his training), but as a simple worker.
 
In the late 1920s Boeke increasingly withdrew from international peace movements. Believing he could build a better society through educating children, he started a school called "De werkplaats" (the workshop). He founded his school in 1926 when all private schools, including the [[Montessori school]] his children attended, started receiving an equal amount of money per child from the state, to which he objected.
[[File:Kees Boeke (1946).jpg|thumb|Kees Boeke with [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] (right) in 1946]]
His school, which uses [[Montessori method|Maria Montessori's methods]], extended by Boeke's own educational ideas, became nationally known; even the Dutch queen Juliana sent her daughters there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/40041487/ (Dutch) De school van Beatrix.] [[Andere Tijden]], 25 september 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been hugely influential for its creative way of making the students co-responsible for their own curriculum, together with the teachers; many students who failed in regular schools have blossomed at "De werkplaats", but on the other hand many talented children could not reach a high level in this school.

Co-responsibility in school did not mean a freewheeling life at "the Werkplaats". Children had to perform tasks such as cleaning the school, growing vegetables and fruits, and helping with lunch cooking. Boeke's notion of sociocracy was, in effect, a secular implementation of the Quaker ideals applied to education in such a way that children were treated as adults, and were on  first-name terms with their teachers.

Boeke wrote a major book on education[what is its title, etc.?!]. One of his last works was [[Cosmic View]] (New York 1957). He died in 1966 in the company of his family.

==Legacy==
Boeke's system of [[sociocracy]] survives today and was expanded upon in the work of a well-known student of the school, Dr. [[Gerard Endenburg]], who in the 1960s and '70s developed a governance and decision-making methodology by the same name while directing the [[Endenburg Electrotechniek]] company.

Boeke's essay/book [[Cosmic View]] (1957) presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale. It inspired several films:

* ''[[Cosmic Zoom]]'' (1968) produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] 
* ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' (1968; new version in 1977) by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] 
* The [[IMAX]] film ''[[Cosmic Voyage]]'' (1996) produced for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].
* "Superpowers of Ten" (2013), a theater piece produced by [[Andrés Jaque]] and performed at the Lisbon Triennial, the Chicago Architectural Biennial, [[Museo Jumex]] in Mexico and [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe 
''Cosmic View'' is mentioned as an inspiration by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of a [[video game]], ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/14/games Cosmic view, inspiration for a video game.] The Guardian, 14 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, he has been serving as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[Chairman]] of [[Infinitum AS]], the operator of the national paid recycling scheme for bottles and cans marked with the official "recyclable" or "[[Container deposit legislation|deposit]]" logo in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arguing about bottle deposit money (English-translated title)|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/krangler-om-pantepenger/241926|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better sorting, better price (English-translated title)|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/industri-jo-bedre-sortering-jo-bedre-pris/248784|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Being a graduated from [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] in [[Trondheim]], Maldum has served in different technical and leadership positions before being appointed as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Infinitum in 2007. He has been a Department Manager at [[National Institute of Technology (Norway)]] Teknologisk Institutt 1990-2000, and CEO of Groceries' Environmental Forum or DMF (DAGLIGVAREHANDELENS MILJØFORUM in Norwegian) 2001–2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going for recycling (English-translated title)|url=http://hmsmagasinet.no/g%C3%A5r-gjenvinning|website=HMSmagasinet.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sørheim|first1=Tone Iren|title=Falling oil price may make deposit bottles less profitable (English-translated title))|url=http://e24.no/naeringsliv/fallende-oljepris-kan-gjoere-panteflaskene-mindre-loennsomme/23429941|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eikernytt.no|url=http://www.eikernytt.no/nyhet.cfm?nyhetid=4839|website=www.eikernytt.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum for fossil plastics strikes a blow for recyclable plastic as a good alternative (English-translated title)|url=http://packnews.no/default.asp?id=8646&amp;show=more|website=packnews.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Dagligvarehandelens miljøforum|url=http://www.etos.no/english/|website=www.etos.no|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocating for environment==
Through his career and especially in deposit-return system for bottles, he became a known figure for advocating for environment in Norway, lecturing at academic gatherings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logistics Seminar in Bergen, February 2007|url=http://www.logistikkforeningen.no/file.php?id=271|website=Logistikkforeningen.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national TV programs to promote the idea of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Søk - Kjell Olav Maldum|url=https://tv.nrk.no/sok?q=Kjell%20Olav%20Maldum&amp;filter=rettigheter|website=NRK TV|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has promoted sustainable production with low impact on environment and recycling of one-way containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vil heve panten på boks og flasker|url=https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/vil-heve-panten-pa-boks-og-flasker-1.7307823|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV 16.09.2011 (program nr 1435)|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/16.09.2011-_program-nr-1435_-1.7794618|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangler 40 millioner bokser|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/mangler-40-millioner-bokser-1.5507016|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid wasting food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right in the garbage with fruit and vegetables (English-translated title)|url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/mat-og-drikke/mat/rett-i-soepla-med-frukt-og-groent/a/105074/|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;In 2006 he won the Optimization Award of the year in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimization Award 2006: the winner is Kjell Olav Maldum - Ny Teknikk|url=http://www.nyteknikk.no/index.php?articleid=2570|website=www.nyteknikk.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the first time that a person won the award instead of an entity for "his extensive efforts to ensure that the retail sector have optimal logistics and thus be the most environmentally friendly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emballasjedagene 07: Kjell Olav Maldum fikk Optimeringsprisen {{!}} PACKobserver|url=http://www.packobserver.dk/idn651.asp|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Maldum has been behind the deposit-return TV commercials and "Infinitum movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum Movement|url=http://infinitummovement.no/|website=Infinitum Movement|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Norway where a number of celebrities, artists and athletes advertise and encourage for recycling of the materials in the society. The movememnt encourages people to infinitely recycle instead the containers instead of just rhewoing them away. Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] also took part&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Se Dagsrevyen 21|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/dagsrevyen-21/NNFA21101614/16-10-2014|website=National Norwegian TV - NRK|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statsministeren gir sin pant til TV-aksjonen|url=http://infinitum.no/aktuelt/statsministeren-gir-sin-pant-til-tv-aksjonen|website=infinitum.no|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the TV action for the bottle recycling.

==Special initiatives==
*Coca-Cola switching to deposit bottles
Until 2014 [[Coca-Cola]] has been using non-deposit bottle for its beverages in Norway. Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cola-kutt kan gi nye arbeidsplasser|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/cola-kutt-kan-gi-nye-arbeidsplasser-1.7991853|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Packaging: Recycling|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/packaging-recycling|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Recycling cans in Norway
Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solholm|first1=Rolleiv|title=More environmentally friendly recycling|url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/culture/museums/29252|website=www.norwaypost.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now recycled in Norway: drink cans get a shorter trip to their new life  - Norsk Hydro|url=http://www.hydro.com/en/Press-room/News/Archive/2013/Now-recycled-in-Norway-drink-cans-get-a-shorter-trip-to-their-new-life-/|website=www.hydro.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6041">A '''Mani Jewel''' ({{CJKV|c=摩尼珠|p=móní zhū|j=mani ju}}) refers to any of various jewels mentioned in [[Buddhist]] literature as either metaphors for several concepts in [[Buddhist philosophy]] or as mythical [[relic]]s. The word ''mani'' is simply [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] for "jewel", so the phrase "Mani Jewel" is in one sense redundant. However, the Mani Jewel metaphors were significantly expanded in Chinese language texts in which it was also called by essentially the same redundant name ''móní zhū'', where the first two characters (摩尼, móní) are the [[Orthographic transcription|transcription]] of ''mani'' and the third character (珠) is its Chinese translation, "jewel". The English phrase "Mani Jewel" is thus in essence a translation of the Chinese term. The use of the Mani Jewel in Buddhist literature includes various magical relics such as the wish-fulfilling [[cintamani]] as well as metaphorical devices to illustrate several ideas such as [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Śūnyatā]].

==Early Literary References==
The Mani Jewel makes its first appearance in the [[Pali]] [[Nikāya]]s where it is mentioned as one of the seven treasures owned by a "wheel-turning king". The Mahasudhassana Sutta in the [[Digha Nikaya]] describes the Mani Jewel as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“It  was  a  beryl,  pure,  excellent,  well-cut 
into  eight  facets,  clear,  bright,  unflawed, 
perfect  in  every  respect. The  luster  of  this 
Jewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana 
round about.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mani Jewel in this text serves as the source of virtue and good governance for the king. Without it he would lose his throne.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Later texts describe the Mani Jewel differently. One version is the [[Cintamani]] or wish-fulfilling jewel. It was said to be originally owned by the God [[Indra]], but it fell to the earth during a war with the [[Asura]]s, allowing whoever possess it to have their wishes granted. Depictions of the [[Bodhisattva]]s [[Ksitigarbha]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]] sometimes show them holding this Cintamani, indicating their ability to fulfill the wishes of sentient beings.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

The Mani Jewel also appears as a water purifying jewel (清水摩尼) where it could be placed in muddy water by traveling monks, causing any cloudiness to settle out leaving the water clear and pure. This version of the jewel is mentioned in the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] where it is used as a metaphor for faith as an agent capable of dispelling uncertainty.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Yet another depiction of the jewel is in the metaphor of [[Indra's net]] which appears in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It describes a net of infinite size with infinite knots, with each knot containing a Mani Jewel with infinite facets. Each individual Mani Jewel reflects every other Mani Jewel in the same way that any individual being or [[phenomenon]] is indistinguishable from the whole or [[noumenon]] due to their fundamental [[Pratītyasamutpāda|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

==In Buddha Nature Sutras==
The [[Lankavatara Sutra]], the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]], and the [[Surangama Sutra]] all used the Mani Jewel as metaphors for [[Buddha-nature]]. In these sutras, a transparent Mani Jewel within us changes colors depending on the conditions around us, representing the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]. The Mani Jewel itself represents each being's Buddha-nature, but because of the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]] of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, a being sees only the various colors emitted by the jewel. These are mistakenly perceived as the defilements rather than the purity of the jewel itself, which is merely reflecting conditions around it. Thus Buddha-nature is not perceived and only the five skandhas are seen, which are then conflated with a sense of self in opposition to the Buddhist idea of [[Anatta|anātman]] or no-self.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

==In Zen==
Later, the Mani Jewel began to appear in texts produced by Zen Buddhists. An early example is found in [[Guifeng Zongmi]]'s work ''Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Transmits the Mind Ground in China'' in which he compares the four contemporary Zen schools: the Northern   School, the Ox Head School, the [[Hongzhou school]] and the [[Heze school]]. He accomplishes this by comparing how each school would interpret the Mani Jewel metaphor used in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment discussed above. According to Guifeng, the Northern School would believe in a fundamentally pure Mani Jewel that must be cleaned to reveal its purity; the Ox Head school would perceive both the color reflections and the Mani Jewel itself as [[Shunyata|empty]]; the Hongzhou school would say that the blackness covering the Mani Jewel is the Jewel itself, and that its purity can never be seen; the Heze School (to which Guifeng belonged) would interpret the black color covering the jewel as an illusion that is in fact just a manifestation of its brightness such that the surface defilements and the purity of the Jewel interpenetrate one another.&lt;ref name=eye1&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|journal=Dharma Eye|pages=12–20|date=March 2015|number=35|month=|title=The 7th Chapter of Shobogenzo Ikka-myoju (One Bright Jewel): Lecture 1|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/dharma/pdf/35e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eihei Dōgen]], a 13th-century Zen monk and founder of the [[Sōtō school]] of Zen Buddhism in Japan, wrote extensively on the Mani Jewel in an essay of his large work the [[Shōbōgenzō]] entitled ''[[Ikka myōju]]'', or ''One Bright Jewel''. The essay primarily comments on the phrase of the [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese monk [[Xuansha Shibei]], who wrote that "the ten-direction world is one bright jewel". His phrase is in turn an adaptation of the earlier writings of Guifeng Zongmi mentioned above.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''maxim''' is a concise expression of a fundamental [[morality|moral]] rule or principle, whether considered as [[wikt:objectivity|objective]] or [[subjectivity|subjective]] contingent on one's [[philosophy]]. A maxim is often [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and motivates specific actions. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' defines it as:
{{quote|Generally any simple and memorable rule or guide for living; for example, 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] speaks of 'a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart ([[Locksley Hall]]), and maxims have generally been associated with a 'folksy' or 'copy-book' approach to [[moral]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Maxim (Oxford University Press 2008) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deontological ethics==

In [[deontological ethics]], mainly in [[Kantian ethics]], maxims are understood as [[subjectivity|subjective]] principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1)&amp;nbsp;the action, or type of action; (2)&amp;nbsp;the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3)&amp;nbsp;the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the [[categorical imperative]] provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.

The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|date=1993|pages=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.&lt;ref name="Gregor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|translator=Mary Gregor |title=Critique of Practical Reason|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=25/5:27|isbn=0-521-59051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, an action is said to have "moral worth" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his [[duty]] purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason.  Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely "from duty", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.

==Personal knowledge==
[[Michael Polanyi]] in his account of [[tacit knowledge]] stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Claxton, ''Live and learn (1992) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multilineal evolution''' is a  20th-century [[social theory]] about the [[evolution of societies]] and [[culture]]s. It is composed of many competing theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. This theory has replaced the older 19th century set of theories of [[unilineal evolution]].

When critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches have changed to reflect their responses to the critique of their predecessor. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgements; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as [[cultural relativism]] and multilineal evolution.

By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as the [[neoevolutionism]]. White rejected the opposition between "primitive" and "modern" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation. Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way.

The anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Elman Service]] wrote a book, ''Evolution and Culture'', in which they attempted to synthesize White's and Steward's approaches. Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are [[Peter Vayda]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Sidney Mintz]] turned away from cultural ecology to [[Marxism]], [[World Systems Theory]], [[Dependency theory]] and [[Marvin Harris]]'s [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].

Today most anthropologists continue to reject 19th century notions of progress and the three original assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment in attempts to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and argue that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. There are still others who continue to reject the entirety of the evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. As a result, the simplistic notion of 'cultural evolution' has grown less useful and given way to an entire series of more nuanced approaches to the relationship of culture and environment. In the area of development studies, authors such as [[Amartya Sen]] have developed an understanding of 'development' and 'human flourishing' that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.

'''''Naree'''''  ({{lang-en|Woman}}) is a 1992 Bangladeshi book about feminism and [[women’s rights]] written by [[Humayun Azad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amarboi.com/2011/11/nari-humayun-azad-pdf.html |script-title=নারী - হুমায়ূন আজাদ |publisher=amarboi.com |language=bn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}{{bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was considered incendiary, and was banned on 19 November 1995, by the [[government of Bangladesh]]. Five years later, though, in 2000, the ban was lifted, following a legal battle that Azad won.&lt;ref name=Mukto-mona&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/link/book.htm |title=Recommended Books |publisher=Mukto-Mona |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Bangladesh]] decided that the prohibition was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banned-books.info/book-content.php?key=90&amp;time=1363397449 |title=Banned-books info. |publisher=banned-books.info |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

The book in Bengali is a feminist analysis of women's status and condition in civilizations created by men. This is the first comprehensive discussion in Bengali about feminism and the difficulties Bengali women face in daily life. The [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] inherent in the work was enough for many to think back on ''[[The Second Sex]]'' written by French feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' by American feminist [[Kate Millett]]. In the work, Azad takes readers on a journey through the broad swathes of experience feminist writers in [[South Asia]] have gone through in their writings. Azad is critical of acclaimed figures, notably [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], for what he considers their anti-feminist perceptions of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahsan  |first=Syed Badrul |date=2 March 2013 |title=Words that have made a difference |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=270984 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad analytically compiles the feminist ideas of the west, which underlie the feminist contributions of the subcontinent's socio-political reformers.&lt;ref name=Mukto-mona/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">The '''parallel individuation system''', also called '''object tracking system''' is a non-[[symbol]]ic [[cognition|cognitive]] system that supports the representation of numerical values from zero to three (in [[infant]]s) or four (in adults and non-human animals). It is one of the two cognitive systems responsible for the [[Number sense|representation of number]], the other one being the [[approximate number system]].&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the approximate number system, which is not precise and provides only an estimation of the number, the parallel individuation system is an exact system and encodes the exact numerical identity of the individual items.&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=D.|title=Two systems of non-symbolic numerical cognition|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel individuation system has been attested in human adults, non-human animals,&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt; such as fish&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human infants, although performance of infants is dependent on their age and task.&lt;ref name= "Feigenson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feigenson|first=L|author2=Dehaene S.|author3=Spelke, E.|title=Core systems of number|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2004|volume=8|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.002|pages=307–314|pmid=15242690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence for parallel individuation system comes from a number of [[experiment]]s on adults, infants and non-human animals. For example, adults perform error-free when they enumerate elements for numerosities from one to four, after which their error rate rises.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt; Similarly, infants of 10 to 12 months represented the values for "exactly one", "exactly two" and "exactly three", but not for higher numbers, in a task based on hidden object retrieval.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt;

[[Number sense in animals|Parallel individuation system in animals]] was demonstrated in an experiment in which [[guppy|guppies]] were tested on their preference of social groups of different size, under the assumption that they have a preference for bigger size groups. In this experiment, fish successfully discriminated between numbers from 1 to 4 but after this number their performance decreased.&lt;ref name=agrillo/&gt; However, not all studies find confirmation of this system and for example [[Petroicidae|New Zealand robins]] showed no difference in their understanding of small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) amounts.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373–2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer critique''', a specialized form of [[critique]], is the common practice of writers reviewing and providing constructive criticism of each other's work. Most fiction writers use some form of peer critique as part of their process of writing.

== In action ==

=== In the classroom ===

Peer critique has long been used as part of the process of teaching writing. In traditional classrooms power and authority can often be teacher-centric,&lt;ref&gt;Goodfellow, R. (2001). Credit where it is due: Assessing students’ contributions to collaborative online learning. In D. Murphy, R. Walker, &amp; G. Webb (Eds.), Online learning and teaching with technology (73–80). London: Kogan Page.&lt;/ref&gt; with teachers correcting work to their own vision of ideal writing.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Stevens, R. (1985). The language of writing groups: How oral response shapes revision. In S. W. Freedman (Ed.). The acquisition of written language: Response and
revision (85–105). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.
&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have found that peer critique offers a complementary style of feedback&lt;ref&gt;Cho, K., Schunn, C. D., &amp; Charney, D. (2006). Commenting on writing: Typology and perceived helpfulness of comments from novice peer reviewers and subject matter experts. Written Communication, 23, 260–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, K., (1988). Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities. Review of Educational Research, 68(3). 249–276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, K., Smith, E. F., Swanson, I., &amp; Elliot, A. (2000). Formative peer assessment of academic writing between postgraduate students. Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education, 25(2), 149–169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saito, H., &amp; Tomoko, F. (2004). Characteristics and user acceptance of peer rating in EFL writing classrooms, Language Teaching Research, 8(1), 31–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas teachers' feedback often focuses on general comments and error correction, peers tend to give specific, deep comments on the work before them rather than correcting to an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Caulk, N. (1997). Comparing teacher and student responses to written work. TESOL Quarterly, 28(1), 181–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his groundbreaking 1973 book ''Writing without Teachers'', [[Peter Elbow]]&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, P. (1973). Writing without Teachers. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; stated a powerful argument for peer-only writing classes, eliminating the teacher from the process entirely. Many informal writing groups still use Elbow's methods for peer critique.

Peer critique has also been found to be useful to those who provide critiques, helping students to develop analytical and critical thinking abilities and become better able to judge their own writing.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. (1984). Helping students help themselves: Peer evaluation of writing. Curriculum Review, 23, 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can also in today’s era be harmful to a students psyche, as these critiques can cause emotional distress on the one being critiqued.  Many of today’s youths can take the critique in a negative manor which can cause them to self doubt or ultimately become depressed.  It has been said that this method maybe outdated and harmful in our age of information.

=== Outside the classroom ===

Peer writing groups have existed probably as long as writing has. Anne Ruggles Gere has written several useful articles and books about the history of writing groups, and how they have evolved over time from social "clubs" and [[chautauquas]] to the many types of groups we have today, including online peer critique sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R. (1987). Writing groups: History, theory and implications. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Abbot, R. D. (1985). Talking about writing: The language of writing groups. Research in the Teaching of English, 19, 362–379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gere, A. R., &amp; Stevens, R. (1985). The language of writing groups: How oral response shapes revision. In S. W. Freedman (Ed.). The acquisition of written language: Response and revision (85–105). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Face-to-face critiques ===

The most traditional form of peer critique, both inside and outside the classroom, is face-to-face. In this method, writers gather together in person and discuss each other's work in detail. Face-to-face writing groups (also known as [[writing circles]], [[writing groups]], or workshops) can be a source of great support and encouragement for writers in what is sometimes a lonely endeavor. The greatest challenge for informal groups is keeping a face-to-face critique group together; many fall apart quickly due to lack of commitment, personality conflicts, or hurt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, P. (1973). Writing without Teachers. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online writing classes ===

In recent years with the advent of the [[Blackboard Learning System]] and similar online teaching tools, it has become possible to take writing courses entirely online. In online courses students generally give each other feedback on writing in message-board style posts. Comments are usually brief. Teachers must beware of the "pile-on effect" of students merely echoing what teachers and previous commenters have mentioned; it will be useful for teachers to apply lessons from peer critique websites, which have functioned online for many years.

=== Online critique sites ===

Since at least 1985, with the [http://community.compuserve.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?webtag=ws-books&amp;redirCnt=1 Compuserve Books &amp; Writer's Forum], writers have formed writing spaces online where they can discuss writing, share resources, and critique work{{fact|date=October 2014}}. There are many active critique sites now, catering to all levels and genres of writers; the popular website Reddit has a sub-reddit dedicated to writing critique, titled [https://www.reddit.com/r/critiquemywriting critique my writing.], while another popular forum, [http://www.writingforums.com www.writingforums.com], is dedicated to writing and online critique. Other peer critique sites include [[Authonomy]] and [[Youwriteon]].

== Types of critique sites ==

Online peer critique sites tend to vary by:
* Charge: Some sites are free, some require membership, and some charge only for premium services
* Privacy: Sites vary on whether they are open to public view, require a password, or require approval by moderators to join
* Style: Many sites use general message-board formats, though some use e-mail loops for actual work
* Genre: There are specific critique sites for romance writers, science fiction/fantasy writers, short story writers, etc.
* Commitment: Nearly all sites generally require some time or activity commitment, but sites vary significantly on how much is required to receive critiques
* Moderation: Some sites are only lightly moderated, and some heavily; a few sites even have editors on staff who judge critiques
* Level of expertise: Some sites cater to beginners, while others have many advanced and published authors on their rosters

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42659">A '''Petri net''', also known as a '''place/transition (PT) net''', is one of several [[mathematical]] [[modeling language]]s for the description of [[distributed systems]].  It is a class of [[discrete event dynamic system]]. A Petri net is a directed [[bipartite graph]], in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows).  Some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Carl Adam | last1 = Petri | first2 = Wolfgang | last2 = Reisig | date = 2008 | title = Petri net | journal = [[Scholarpedia]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | page = 6477 | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Petri_net | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6477}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by [[Carl Adam Petri]]—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.

Like industry standards such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s, [[Business Process Model and Notation]] and [[Event-driven process chain|EPC]]s, Petri nets offer a [[diagram|graphical notation]] for stepwise processes that include choice, [[iteration]], and [[Concurrent computing|concurrent execution]]. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.

[[Image:Animated Petri net commons.gif|thumb|(a) Petri net trajectory example]]

== Petri net basics ==
A Petri net consists of ''places'', ''transitions'', and ''[[graph theory|arc]]s''.  Arcs run from a place to a transition or vice versa, never between places or between transitions.  The places from which an arc runs to a transition are called the ''input places'' of the transition; the places to which arcs run from a transition are called the ''output places'' of the transition.

Graphically, places in a Petri net may contain a discrete number of marks called ''tokens''.  Any distribution of tokens over the places will represent a configuration of the net called a ''marking''.  In an abstract sense relating to a Petri net diagram, a transition of a Petri net may ''fire'' if it is ''enabled'', i.e. there are sufficient tokens in all of its input places; when the transition fires, it consumes the required input tokens, and creates tokens in its output places.  A firing is atomic, i.e. a single non-interruptible step.

Unless an ''execution policy'' {{Example needed|date=September 2018}} is defined, the execution of Petri nets is [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]]: when multiple transitions are enabled at the same time, they will fire in any order.

Since firing is nondeterministic, and multiple tokens may be present anywhere in the net (even in the same place),  Petri nets are well suited for modeling the [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] behavior of distributed systems.

== Formal definition and basic terminology ==
Petri nets are [[State transition system|state-transition systems]] that extend a class of nets called elementary nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Rozenburg | first2 = J. | last2 = Engelfriet | chapter = Elementary Net Systems | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Reisig | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | title = Lectures on Petri Nets I: Basic Models – Advances in Petri Nets | volume = 1491 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | publisher = Springer | date = 1998 | pages = 12–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition 1.''' A ''net'' is a [[Tuple|triple]] &lt;math&gt;N = (P, T, F)&lt;/math&gt; where:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are ''disjoint'' finite sets of ''places'' and ''transitions'', respectively.
# &lt;math&gt;F \subset (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''arcs'' (or flow relations).

'''Definition 2.''' Given a net ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F''), a ''configuration'' is a set ''C'' so that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P''.

[[File:Petri Net A.jpg|thumb|A Petri net with an enabled transition.]][[File:Petri Net B.jpg|thumb|The Petri net that follows after the transition fires (Initial Petri net in the figure above).]]
'''Definition 3.''' An ''elementary net'' is a net of the form ''EN'' = (''N'', ''C'') where:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'') is a net.
# ''C'' is such that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P'' is a ''configuration''.

'''Definition 4.''' A ''Petri net'' is a net of the form ''PN'' = (''N'', ''M'', ''W''), which extends the elementary net so that:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'' ) is a net.
# ''M'' : ''P'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is a place [[multiset]], where ''Z'' is a [[countable set]]. ''M'' extends the concept of ''configuration'' and is commonly described with reference to Petri net diagrams as a ''marking''.
# ''W'' : ''F'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is an arc [[multiset]], so that the count (or weight) for each arc is a measure of the arc ''multiplicity''.

If a Petri net is equivalent to an elementary net, then ''Z'' can be the countable set {0,1} and those elements in ''P'' that map to 1 under ''M'' form a configuration. Similarly, if a Petri net is not an elementary net, then the [[multiset]] ''M'' can be interpreted as representing a non-singleton set of configurations. In this respect, ''M'' extends the concept of configuration for elementary nets to Petri nets.

In the diagram of a Petri net (see top figure right), places are conventionally depicted with circles, transitions with long narrow rectangles and arcs as one-way arrows that show connections of places to transitions or transitions to places. If the diagram were of an elementary net, then those places in a configuration would be conventionally depicted as circles, where each circle encompasses a single dot called a ''token''. In the given diagram of a Petri net (see right), the place circles may encompass more than one token to show the number of times a place appears in a configuration. The configuration of tokens distributed over an entire Petri net diagram is called a ''marking''.

In the top figure (see right), the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an input place of transition ''t''; whereas, the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an output place to the same transition. Let ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. top) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. bottom) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. The configuration of ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''enable'' transition ''t'' through the property that all input places have sufficient number of tokens (shown in the figures as dots) "equal to or greater" than the multiplicities on their respective arcs to ''t''. Once and only once a transition is enabled will the transition fire. In this example, the ''firing'' of transition ''t'' generates a map that has the marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the image of ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and results in Petri net ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', seen in the bottom figure. In the diagram, the firing rule for a transition can be characterised by subtracting a number of tokens from its input places equal to the multiplicity of the respective input arcs and accumulating a new number of tokens at the output places equal to the multiplicity of the respective output arcs.

'''Remark 1.''' The precise meaning of "equal to or greater" will depend on the precise algebraic properties of addition being applied on ''Z'' in the firing rule, where subtle variations on the algebraic properties can lead to other classes of Petri nets; for example, Algebraic Petri nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reisig | first1 = Wolfgang | date = 1991 | title = Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications | url = | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(91)90203-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following formal definition is loosely based on {{harv|Peterson|1981}}.  Many alternative definitions exist.

=== Syntax ===

A '''Petri net graph''' (called ''Petri net'' by some, but see below) is a 3-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* ''S'' is a [[finite set]] of ''places''
* ''T'' is a finite set of ''transitions''
* ''S'' and ''T'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], i.e. no object can be both a place and a transition
* &lt;math&gt;W: (S \times T) \cup (T \times S) \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiset]] of [[directed edge|arc]]s, i.e. it assigns to each arc a non-negative integer ''arc multiplicity'' (or weight); note that no arc may connect two places or two transitions.

The ''flow relation'' is the set of arcs: &lt;math&gt; F = \{ (x,y) \mid W(x,y) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  In many textbooks, arcs can only have multiplicity 1. These texts often define Petri nets using ''F'' instead of ''W''.  When using this convention, a Petri net graph is a [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] [[multigraph]] &lt;math&gt;(S \cup T, F)&lt;/math&gt; with node partitions ''S'' and ''T''.

The ''preset'' of a transition ''t'' is the set of its ''input places'': &lt;math&gt;{}^{\bullet}t = \{ s \in S \mid W(s,t) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;;
its ''postset'' is the set of its ''output places'': &lt;math&gt;t^{\bullet} = \{ s \in S \mid W(t,s) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. Definitions of pre- and postsets of places are analogous.

A ''marking'' of a Petri net (graph) is a multiset of its places, i.e., a mapping &lt;math&gt;M: S \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We say the marking assigns to each place a number of ''tokens''.

A '''Petri net''' (called ''marked Petri net'' by some, see above) is a 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net graph;
* &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial marking'', a marking of the Petri net graph.

=== Execution semantics ===

In words:
* firing a transition {{mvar|t}} in a marking {{mvar|M}} consumes &lt;math&gt;W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; tokens from each of its input places {{mvar|s}}, and produces &lt;math&gt;W(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; tokens in each of its output places {{mvar|s}}
* a transition is ''enabled'' (it may ''fire'') in {{mvar|M}} if there are enough tokens in its input places for the consumptions to be possible, i.e. iff &lt;math&gt;\forall s: M(s) \geq W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

We are generally interested in what may happen when transitions may continually fire in arbitrary order.

We say that a marking {{mvar|M'}} ''is reachable from'' a marking {{mvar|M}} ''in one step'' if &lt;math&gt;M \underset{G}{\longrightarrow} M'&lt;/math&gt;; we say that it ''is reachable from {{mvar|M}}'' if &lt;math&gt;M \overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}} M'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, if it is reachable in 0 or more steps.

For a (marked) Petri net &lt;math&gt;N=(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, we are interested in the firings that can be performed starting with the initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Its set of ''reachable markings'' is the set
&lt;math&gt;R(N) \ \stackrel{D}{=}\ \left\{ M' \Bigg| M_0 \xrightarrow[(S,T,W)]{*} M' \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

The ''reachability graph'' of {{mvar|N}} is the transition relation &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to its reachable markings &lt;math&gt;R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is the [[state space]] of the net.

A ''firing sequence'' for a Petri net with graph {{mvar|G}} and initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of transitions &lt;math&gt;\vec \sigma = \langle t_{i_1} \cdots t_{i_n} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M_0 \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_1}]{} M_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge M_{n-1} \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_n}]{} M_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of firing sequences is denoted as &lt;math&gt;L(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variations on the definition ==

As already remarked, a common variation is to disallow arc multiplicities and replace the [[multiset|bag]] of arcs ''W'' with a simple set, called the ''flow relation'', &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq (S \times T) \cup (T \times S)&lt;/math&gt;.
This doesn't limit [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] as both can represent each other.

Another common variation, e.g. in, Desel and Juhás (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/a6lmwqye66ll5w56/ | last1 = Desel | first1 = Jörg | last2 = Juhás | first2 = Gabriel | chapter = What Is a Petri Net? Informal Answers for the Informed Reader | editor1-first = Hartmut | editor1-last = Ehrig | title = Unifying Petri Nets | series = LNCS | volume = 2128 | pages = 1–25 | date = 2001 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=2014-05-14|display-editors=etal| isbn = 9783540430674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to allow ''capacities'' to be defined on places.  This is discussed under ''extensions'' below.

== Formulation in terms of vectors and matrices ==

The markings of a Petri net &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of nonnegative integers of length &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

Its transition relation can be described as a pair of &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|T|&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]:
* &lt;math&gt;W^-&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^-[s,t] = W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;W^+&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^+[s,t] = W(t,s).&lt;/math&gt;
Then their difference
* &lt;math&gt; W^T = W^+ - W^-&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to describe the reachable markings in terms of matrix multiplication, as follows.
For any sequence of transitions {{mvar|w}}, write &lt;math&gt;o(w)&lt;/math&gt; for the vector that maps every transition to its number of occurrences in {{mvar|w}}.  Then, we have
* &lt;math&gt;R(N) = \{ M \mid \exists w: M = M_0 + W^T \cdot o(w) \wedge w \text{ is a firing sequence of } N \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- the \!s make the \{ and \} the same size. --&gt;

Note that it must be required that {{mvar|w}} is a firing sequence; allowing arbitrary sequences of transitions will generally produce a larger set.

[[Image:detailed petri net.png|frame|(b) Petri net Example]] 
:&lt;math&gt;W^{+}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ p3 &amp; 1&amp; 0 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^{-}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 \\ p2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^T=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; -1  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p3 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{0}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Mathematical properties of Petri nets ==

One thing that makes Petri nets interesting is that they provide a balance between modeling power and analyzability: many things one would like to know about concurrent systems can be automatically determined for Petri nets, although some of those things are very expensive to determine in the general case.  Several subclasses of Petri nets have been studied that can still model interesting classes of concurrent systems, while these problems become easier.

An overview of such [[decision problem]]s, with decidability and complexity results for Petri nets and some subclasses, can be found in
Esparza and Nielsen (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/226920.html | title = Decidability issues for Petri nets – a survey | first1 = Javier | last1 = Esparza | first2 = Mogens | last2 = Nielsen | journal = Bulletin of the EATCS | origyear = 1994 | edition = Revised | date = 1995 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reachability ===
The [[reachability problem]] for Petri nets is to decide, given a Petri net ''N'' and a marking ''M'', whether &lt;math&gt;M \in  R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, this is a matter of walking the reachability graph defined above, until either we reach the requested marking or we know it can no longer be found.  This is harder than it may seem at first: the reachability graph is generally infinite, and it is not easy to determine when it is safe to stop.

In fact, this problem was shown to be [[EXPSPACE]]-hard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lipton | first = R. | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/contextsummary/115623/0 | title = The Reachability Problem Requires Exponential Space | journal = Technical Report 62 | date = 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; years before it was shown to be decidable at all (Mayr, 1981).  Papers continue to be published on how to do it efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = P. | last = Küngas | url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/%7Epeep/papers/SARA2005Kung.ps | title = Petri Net Reachability Checking Is Polynomial with Optimal Abstraction Hierarchies | conference = Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation and Approximation—SARA 2005 | location = Airth Castle, Scotland, UK | date = July 26–29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2018) Czerwinski et al improved the lower bound and showed that the problem is not [[ELEMENTARY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1809.07115|last1=Czerwinski|first1=Wojciech|title=The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary (Extended Abstract)|last2=Lasota|first2=Slawomir|last3=Lazic|first3=Ranko|last4=Leroux|first4=Jerome|last5=Mazowiecki|first5=Filip|class=cs.FL|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reachability seems to be a good tool to find erroneous states, for practical problems the constructed graph usually has far too many states to calculate. To alleviate this problem, [[linear temporal logic]] is usually used in conjunction with the [[Method of analytic tableaux|tableau method]] to prove that such states cannot be reached. LTL uses the [[semi-decision procedure|semi-decision technique]] to find if indeed a state can be reached, by finding a set of necessary conditions for the state to be reached then proving that those conditions cannot be satisfied.

=== Liveness ===

[[Image:liveness-levels.gif|thumb|right|A Petri net in which transition &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is dead, while for all &lt;math&gt;j&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-live]]

Petri nets can be described as having different degrees of liveness &lt;math&gt;L_1 - L_4&lt;/math&gt;. A Petri net &lt;math&gt;(N, M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live [[if and only if|iff]] all of its transitions are &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live, where a transition is
* ''dead'', if it can never fire, i.e. it is not in any firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live (''potentially fireable''), iff it may fire, i.e. it is in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire arbitrarily often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_3&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire infinitely often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in {{mvar|V}}, for some prefix-closed set of firing sequences &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{V \subseteq L(N,M_0)}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_4&lt;/math&gt;-live (''live'') iff it may always fire, i.e. it is &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live in every reachable marking in &lt;math&gt;R(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these are increasingly stringent requirements: &lt;math&gt;L_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt;-liveness implies &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-liveness, for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{j \in {1,2,3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

These definitions are in accordance with Murata's overview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cs.uic.edu/bin/view/Murata/Publications | title = Petri Nets: Properties, Analysis and Applications | first = Tadao | last = Murata | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–558 | date = April 1989 | accessdate = 2014-10-13 | doi=10.1109/5.24143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which additionally uses &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;''-live'' as a term for ''dead''.

=== Boundedness ===
[[File:Reachability graph for petri net.png|right|frame|width=50px|The reachability graph of ''N2''.]]

A place in a Petri net is called ''k-bounded'' if it does not contain more than ''k'' tokens in all reachable markings, including the initial marking; it is said to be ''safe'' if it is 1-bounded; it is ''[[bounded set|bounded]]'' if it is ''k-bounded'' for some ''k''.

A (marked) Petri net is called ''k''-bounded, ''safe'', or ''bounded'' when all of its places are.
A Petri net (graph) is called ''(structurally) bounded'' if it is bounded for every possible initial marking.

Note that a Petri net is bounded if and only if its reachability graph is finite.

Boundedness is decidable by looking at [[covering problem|covering]], by constructing the [[Richard Karp|Karp]]–Miller Tree.

It can be useful to explicitly impose a bound on places in a given net.
This can be used to model limited system resources.

Some definitions of Petri nets explicitly allow this as a syntactic feature.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~mchen/BioPNML/Intro/pnfaq.html
  |ref=harv
  |title=Petri Nets
  |website = www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Formally, ''Petri nets with place capacities'' can be defined as tuples &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,C,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net, &lt;math&gt;C: P \rightarrow\!\!\!\shortmid I\!N&lt;/math&gt; an assignment of capacities to (some or all) places, and the transition relation is the usual one restricted to the markings in which each place with a capacity has at most that many tokens.

[[File:Two-boundedness-ub.png|right|frame|An unbounded Petri net, ''N''.]]

For example, if in the net ''N'', both places are assigned capacity 2, we obtain a Petri net with place capacities, say ''N2''; its reachability graph is displayed on the right.

[[File:Two-boundedness-cb.png|right|frame|A two-bounded Petri net, obtained by extending ''N'' with "counter-places".]]

Alternatively, places can be made bounded by extending the net.  To be exact,
a place can be made ''k''-bounded by adding a "counter-place" with flow opposite to that of the place, and adding tokens to make the total in both places ''k''.

==Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri nets==

As well as for discrete events, there are Petri nets for continuous and hybrid discrete-continuous processes that are useful in discrete, continuous and hybrid [[control theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VsS0JkMcXGwC | title = Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri Nets | first1 = René | last1 = David | first2 = Hassane | last2 = Alla | publisher = Springer | date = 2005 | isbn = 978-3-540-22480-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to discrete, continuous and hybrid [[automata theory|automata]].

==Extensions==
There are many extensions to Petri nets. Some of them are completely backwards-compatible (e.g. [[coloured Petri nets]]) with the original Petri net, some add properties that cannot be modelled in the original Petri net formalism (e.g. timed Petri nets). Although backwards-compatible models do not extend the computational power of Petri nets, they may have more succinct representations and may be more convenient for modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=Kurt|title=A brief introduction to colored Petri nets|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~andersmo/petrinet/papers/cpn/brief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions that cannot be transformed into Petri nets are sometimes very powerful, but usually lack the full range of mathematical tools available to analyse ordinary Petri nets.

The term  [[high-level Petri net]] is used for many Petri net formalisms that extend the basic P/T net formalism; this includes coloured Petri nets, hierarchical Petri nets such as [[Nets within Nets]], and all other extensions sketched in this section.  The term is also used specifically for the type of coloured nets supported by [[CPN Tools]].

A short list of possible extensions:

*Additional types of arcs; two common types are:
**a ''reset arc'' does not impose a precondition on firing, and empties the place when the transition fires; this makes reachability undecidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = T. | last1 = Araki | first2 = T. | last2 = Kasami | title = Some Decision Problems Related to the Reachability Problem for Petri Nets | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–104 | date = 1977 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(76)90067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other properties, such as termination, remain decidable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = C. | last1 = Dufourd | first2 = A. | last2 = Finkel | first3 = Ph. | last3 =Schnoebelen | chapter = Reset Nets Between Decidability and Undecidability | title = Proceedings of the 25th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] | volume = 1443 | pages = 103–115 | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**an ''inhibitor arc'' imposes the precondition that the transition may only fire when the place is empty; this allows arbitrary computations on numbers of tokens to be expressed, which makes the formalism [[Turing complete]] and implies existence of a universal net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaitsev | first = D. A. | title = Toward the Minimal Universal Petri Net | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems | date = 2013 | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.2012.2237549 | volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a standard Petri net, tokens are indistinguishable.  In a [[Coloured Petri net]], every token has a value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPnets/intro/verybrief.html | title = Very Brief Introduction to CP-nets | publisher = Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus, Denmark }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular tools for coloured Petri nets such as [[CPN Tools]], the values of tokens are typed, and can be tested (using ''guard'' expressions) and manipulated with a [[functional programming language]]. A subsidiary of coloured Petri nets are the [[well-formed Petri net]]s, where the arc and guard expressions are restricted to make it easier to analyse the net.
*Another popular extension of Petri nets is hierarchy; this in the form of different views supporting levels of refinement and abstraction was studied by Fehling. Another form of hierarchy is found in so-called object Petri nets or object systems  where a Petri net can contain Petri nets as its tokens inducing a hierarchy of nested Petri nets that communicate by synchronisation of transitions on different levels. See&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://llpn.com/OPNs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103131745/http://www.llpn.com/OPNs.html |archivedate=2005-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an informal introduction to object Petri nets.
*A [[Vector addition system|vector addition system with states (VASS)]] is an equivalent formalism to Petri nets.  However, it can be superficially viewed as a generalisation of Petri nets. Consider a [[finite state automaton]] where each transition is labelled by a transition from the Petri net. The Petri net is then synchronised with the finite state automaton, i.e., a transition in the automaton is taken at the same time as the corresponding transition in the Petri net. It is only possible to take a transition in the automaton if the corresponding transition in the Petri net is enabled, and it is only possible to fire a transition in the Petri net if there is a transition from the current state in the automaton labelled by it. (The definition of VASS is usually formulated slightly differently.)
*[[Prioritised Petri net]]s add priorities to transitions, whereby a transition cannot fire, if a higher-priority transition is enabled (i.e. can fire). Thus, transitions are in priority groups, and e.g. priority group 3 can only fire if all transitions are disabled in groups 1 and 2. Within a priority group, firing is ''still'' non-deterministic.
*The non-deterministic property has been a very valuable one, as it lets the user abstract a large number of properties (depending on what the net is used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, [[timed Petri nets]] have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the [[stochastic Petri net]]s that add [[nondeterministic time]] through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The [[Exponential distribution|exponential random distribution]] is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph can be used as a continuous time [[Markov chain]] (CTMC).
*[[Dualistic Petri Nets]] (dP-Nets) is a Petri Net extension developed by E. Dawis, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Dawis | first1 = E. P. | first2 = J. F. | last2 = Dawis | first3 = Wei-Pin | last3 = Koo | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics | volume = 3 | pages = 1554–1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to better represent real-world process.  dP-Nets balance the duality of change/no-change, action/passivity, (transformation) time/space, etc., between the bipartite Petri Net constructs of transformation and place resulting in the unique characteristic of ''transformation marking'', i.e., when the transformation is "working" it is marked.  This allows for the transformation to fire (or be marked) multiple times representing the real-world behavior of process throughput.  Marking of the transformation assumes that transformation time must be greater than zero.  A zero transformation time used in many typical Petri Nets may be mathematically appealing but impractical in representing real-world processes.  dP-Nets also exploit the power of Petri Nets' hierarchical abstraction to depict [[Process architecture]].  Complex process systems are modeled as a series of simpler nets interconnected through various levels of hierarchical abstraction.  The process architecture of a packet switch is demonstrated in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Dawis | first = E. P. | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and signal Processing | volume = 1 | pages = 323–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where development requirements are organized around the structure of the designed system.

There are many more extensions to Petri nets, however, it is important to keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, it is a good idea to use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.

== Restrictions ==
[[Image:petri net types.svg|thumb|Petri net types graphically]]

Instead of extending the Petri net formalism, we can also look at restricting it, and look at particular types of Petri nets, obtained by restricting the syntax in a particular way.  Ordinary Petri nets are the nets where all arc weights are 1.  Restricting further, the following types of ordinary Petri nets are commonly used and studied:

# In a [[state machine]] (SM), every transition has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc, and all markings have exactly one token. As a consequence, there can ''not'' be ''concurrency'', but there can be ''conflict'' (i.e. [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation|nondeterminism]]). Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T: |t^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet t|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a [[marked graph]] (MG), every place has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc. This means, that there can ''not'' be ''conflict'', but there can be ''concurrency''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: |s^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet s|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a ''free choice'' net (FC), – every arc from a place to a transition is either the only arc from that place or the only arc to that transition. I.e. there can be ''both concurrency and conflict, but not at the same time''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: (|s^\bullet|\leq 1) \vee ({}^\bullet (s^\bullet)=\{s\})&lt;/math&gt;
# Extended free choice (EFC) – a Petri net that can be ''transformed into an FC''.
# In an ''asymmetric choice'' net (AC), concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''confusion'') may occur, but ''not symmetrically''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s_1,s_2\in S: (s_1{}^\bullet \cap s_2{}^\bullet\neq \emptyset) \to [(s_1{}^\bullet\subseteq s_2{}^\bullet) \vee (s_2{}^\bullet\subseteq s_1{}^\bullet)]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- the next definition needs to be cleaned up by someone who understands what is meant here
# In a ''multiple asymmetric choice'' net (MAC), multiple concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''multiple confusion'') may occur, but no ''confusion''. Mathematically: ''for a set |P|=k,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T &lt;/math&gt; exist a subset &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet t,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet T &lt;/math&gt; contains all subsets and is the powerset 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; without the empty subset
--&gt;

==Work flow nets==
[[Workflow net]]s (WF-nets) are a subclass of Petri nets intending to model the [[workflow]] of process activities.&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last = van der Aalst | first = W. M. P. | date = 1998 | url = http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wvdaalst/publications/p53.pdf | title = The application of Petri nets to workflow management | journal = Journal of Circuits, Systems and Computers | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–66 | doi=10.1142/s0218126698000043| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The WF-net transitions are assigned to tasks or activities, and places are assigned to the pre/post conditions.
The WF-nets have additional structural and operational requirements, mainly the addition of a single input (source) place with no previous transitions, and output place (sink) with no following transitions. Accordingly, start and termination markings can be defined that represent the process status.

WF-nets have the '''soundness''' property,&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; indicating that a process with a start marking of k tokens in its source place, can reach the termination state marking with k tokens in its sink place (defined as K-sound WF-net). Additionally, all the transitions in the process could fire (i.e., for each transition there is a reachable state in which the transition is enabled). 
A general sound (G-sound) WF-net is defined as being K-sound for every k&gt;0.&lt;ref name="Hee et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = van Hee | first1 = K. | last2 = Sidorova | first2 = N. | last3 = Voorhoeve | first3 = M. | date = 2003 | chapter-url = http://www.win.tue.nl/~sidorova/03/van_Hee_Sidorova_Voorhoeve.pdf | chapter = Soundness and separability of workflow nets in the stepwise refinement approach | editor1-last = van der Aalst | editor1-first = W.

P. | editor2-last = Best | editor2-first =E. | title = Application and Theory of Petri Nets 2003 | series = Lect Notes in Comput Sci | volume = 2678 | pages = 337–356 | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A directed '''[[Path (graph theory)|path]]''' in the Petri net is defined as the sequence of nodes (places and transitions) linked by the directed arcs. An '''elementary path''' includes every node in the sequence only once.

A '''Well-handled''' Petri net is a net in which there are no fully distinct elementary paths between a place and a transition (or transition and a place), i.e., if there are two paths between the pair of node then these paths share a node.
An acyclic well-handled WF-net is sound (G-sound).&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Ping | first1 = L. | last2 = Hao | first2 = H. | last3 = Jian | first3 =L. | date = 2004 | title = On 1-soundness and soundness of workflow nets | editor-first = Daniel | editor-last = Moldt | conference = Proc of the 3rd Workshop on Modelling of Objects, Components, and Agents | location = Aarhus, Denmark | publisher = DAIMI PB | volume = 571 | pages = 21–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended WF-net is a Petri net that is composed of a WF-net with additional transition t (feedback transition). The sink place is connected as the input place of transition t and the source place as its output place. Firing of the transition causes iteration of the process (Note: the extended WF-net is not a WF-net).&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; 
 
WRI (Well-handled with Regular Iteration) WF-net, is an extended acyclic well-handled WF-net.  
WRI-WF-net can be built as composition of nets, i.e., replacing a transition within a WRI-WF-net with a subnet which is a WRI-WF-net. The result is also WRI-WF-net. WRI-WF-nets are G-sound,&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004" /&gt; therefore by using only WRI-WF-net building blocks, one can get WF-nets that are G-sound by construction.

The [[Design structure matrix]] (DSM) can model process relations, and be utilized for process planning. The '''DSM-nets''' are realization of DSM-based plans into workflow processes by Petri nets, and are equivalent to WRI-WF-nets. The DSM-net construction process ensures the soundness property of the resulting net.

==Other models of concurrency==

Other ways of modelling concurrent computation have been proposed, including [[process algebra]], the [[actor model]], and [[trace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Antoni | last = Mazurkiewicz | chapter = Introduction to Trace Theory | title = The Book of Traces | editor1-first = V. | editor1-last = Diekert | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | publisher = World Scientific | location = Singapore | date = 1995 | pages = 3–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different models provide tradeoffs of concepts such as [[compositionality]], [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]], and locality.

An approach to relating some of these models of concurrency is proposed in the chapter by Winskel and Nielsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Winskel | first2 = M. | last2 = Nielsen | chapter-url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/PB/463/PB-463.pdf | chapter = Models for Concurrency | title = Handbook of Logic and the Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 1–148 | publisher = OUP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phase diagram''' in [[physical chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[mineralogy]], and [[materials science]] is a type of [[chart]] used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct [[phase (matter)|phases]] (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

== Overview ==
Common components of a phase diagram are ''lines of equilibrium'' or ''phase boundaries'', which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium.  Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium.

[[Triple point]]s are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect.  Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist.  For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium ({{val|273.16|ul=K}} and a partial vapor pressure of {{val|611.657|ul=Pa}}).

The [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The [[liquidus]] is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a "[[slurry]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Predel |first=Bruno |last2=Hoch |first2=Michael J. R. |last3=Pool |first3=Monte |year=2004 |title=Phase Diagrams and Heterogeneous Equilibria: A Practical Introduction |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |isbn=3-540-14011-5}}&lt;!-- Reference 1 covers most of the article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Working fluids]] are often categorized by on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

== Types ==

=== 2-dimensional diagrams ===
[[Image:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|310x310px|A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dotted green line gives [[Water (molecule)#Density of water and ice|the anomalous behavior of water]].  The green lines mark the [[freezing point]] and the blue line the [[boiling point]], showing how they vary with pressure.]]The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as [[water (molecule)|water]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] correspond to the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point.  The open spaces, where the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is [[analytic function|analytic]], correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where [[phase transition]]s occur, which are called '''phase boundaries'''.

In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Papon |first2=J. |last2=Leblond |first3=P. H. E. |last3=Meijer |title=The Physics of Phase Transition : Concepts and Applications |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=3-540-43236-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|647.096|K|C}}, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|22.064|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 356&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.&lt;ref&gt;The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam [http://www.iapws.org/relguide/fundam.pdf "Guideline on the Use of Fundamental Physical Constants and Basic Constants of Water"], 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same [[symmetry group]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive [[slope]] so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is [[Density|denser]] than the liquid phase.&lt;ref name=Whitten&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitten |first1=Kenneth W. |last2=Galley |first2=Kenneth D.  |last3=Davis |first3=Raymond E. |date=1992 |title=General Chemistry. |edition=4th |page=477 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's [[intermolecular forces]]. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.&lt;ref name=Dorin&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemistry : The Study of Matter Prentice |last1=Dorin |first1=Henry |last2=Demmin |first2=Peter E. |last3=Gabel |first3=Dorothy L. |edition=Fourth |pages=266–273 |isbn=0-13-127333-7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of [[hydrogen bond]]ing which requires a greater separation of water molecules.&lt;ref name=Whitten/&gt; Other exceptions are [[antimony]] and [[bismuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |date=2012 |title=Principles of General Chemistry |chapter=11.7 Phase Diagrams |chapter-url=https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s15-07-phase-diagrams.html |publisher=Creative Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrucci |first1=Ralph H. |last2=Harwood |first2=William S.  |last3=Herring |first3=F. Geoffrey |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry. Principles and Modern Applications |edition=8th |page=477 |publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the slope dP/dT is given by the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation|Clapeyron equation]] for fusion (melting)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laidler |first1=Keith J. |last2=Meiser |first2=John H. |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |pages=173-4 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{\Delta_{fus} H}{T\,\Delta_{fus} V}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ΔH&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume change for fusion. For most substances ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is negative so that the slope is negative.

====Other thermodynamic properties====
In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams.  Examples of such thermodynamic properties include [[specific volume]], [[specific enthalpy]], or specific [[entropy]].  For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (''T'' vs. ''s'') for water/[[steam]] or for a [[refrigerant]] are commonly used to illustrate [[thermodynamic cycle]]s such as a [[Carnot cycle]], [[Rankine cycle]], or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle.

In a [[two-dimensional graph]], two of the thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines - curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these '''iso-'''lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.
[[Image:TS-Wasserdampf engl.png|thumb|center|540 px|Temperature vs. specific entropy phase diagram for water/steam. In the area under the red dome, liquid water and steam coexist in equilibrium. The critical point is at the top of the dome. Liquid water is to the left of the dome. Steam is to the right of the dome. The blue lines/curves are '''isobars''' showing constant pressure. The green lines/curves are '''isochors''' showing constant specific volume. The red curves show constant quality.]]

===3-dimensional diagrams===
[[File:pVT 3D diagram.png|thumb|200px|''p''–''v''–''T'' 3D diagram for fixed amount of pure material]]
It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zemansky |first1=Mark W. |last2=Dittman |first2=Richard H. |year=1981 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |edition=6th |at=Figs. 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 10-10, P10-1 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0-07-072808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Web applet: [http://biomodel.uah.es/Jmol/plots/phase-diagrams/ 3D Phase Diagrams for Water, Carbon Dioxide and Ammonia]. Described in {{cite journal |last1=Glasser |first1=Leslie |last2=Herráez |first2=Angel |last3=Hanson |first3=Robert M. |year=2009 |title=Interactive 3D Phase Diagrams Using Jmol |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=566 |doi=10.1021/ed086p566}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (''T'') on one axis, pressure (''p'') on a second axis, and specific volume (''v'') on a third.  Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a '''triple line''' is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.

For water, the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram is seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=David |first1=Carl |title=Verwiebe's "3-D" Ice phase diagram reworked |url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/chem_educ/94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An [[orthographic projection]] of the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

===Binary mixtures===
Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case, [[concentration]] becomes an important variable.  Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.
[[Image:Brosen ironcarbon.svg|thumb|250px|left|The iron–iron carbide (Fe–Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C) phase diagram. The percentage of carbon present and the temperature define the phase of the iron carbon alloy and therefore its physical characteristics and mechanical properties. The percentage of carbon determines the type of the ferrous alloy: iron, steel or cast iron]]
[[Image:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|right|250px|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]

One type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations of two substances in a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[mixture]] called a ''binary phase diagram'', as shown at right. Such a mixture can be either a [[solid solution]], [[eutectic point|eutectic]] or [[peritectic]], among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a ''boiling-point diagram'' for a mixture of two components, i. e. [[chemical compound]]s. For two particular [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components at a certain pressure such as [[atmospheric pressure]], a boiling-point diagram shows what [[vapor]] (gas) compositions are in [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|equilibrium]] with given liquid compositions depending on temperature.  In a typical binary boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.
[[Image:Binary Boiling Point Diagram new.svg|thumb|250px|right|Boiling-point diagram]]

A simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-[[Azeotrope|azeotropic]] mixture is shown at right.  The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium#Boiling-point diagrams|Vapor–liquid equilibrium]] for more information.

In addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are thousands of other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the [[peritectoid]], a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.

A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the [[iron]]–[[carbon]] system for less than 7% carbon (see [[steel]]).

The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is [[mole fraction]]. A volume-based measure like [[molarity]] would be inadvisable.

===Crystals===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphic]] and [[Polyamorphism|polyamorphic]] substances have multiple [[crystal]] or [[amorphous]] phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.

[[Image:Phase diagram of water.svg|thumb|700px|centre|[[Semi-log plot|Log-lin]] pressure–temperature phase diagram of water. The [[Roman numeral]]s indicate various [[Ice#Phases|ice phases]]. A similar diagram may be found on the site Water structure and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html Water structure and science] Site by Martin Chaplin, accessed 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Mesophases===
Some organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and liquid; these states are called [[mesophase]]s. Attention has been directed to mesophases because they enable [[display device]]s and have become commercially important through the so-called [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystal]] technology. Phase diagrams are used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chandrasekhar |first1=Sivaramakrishna  |author-link= Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar |year=1992 |title=Liquid Crystals |edition=2nd |pages=27–29, 356 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-41747-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">The '''Press–Schechter formalism''' is a [[mathematical model]] for predicting the number of objects (such as [[galaxies]] or [[galaxy clusters]]) of a certain mass within a given volume of the Universe. It was described in a famous [[Academic paper|paper]] by [[William H. Press]] and [[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P Formation of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies by Self-Similar Gravitational Condensation], W.H. Press, P. Schechter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the context of [[Dark matter|cold dark matter]] cosmological models,
perturbations on all scales are imprinted on the universe at very early times,
for example by quantum fluctuations during an [[Inflationary cosmology|inflationary era]].
Later, as radiation redshifts away, these become mass perturbations, and they
start to grow linearly.  Only long after that, starting with small mass scales
and advancing over time to larger mass scales, do the perturbations actually
collapse to form (for example) galaxies or clusters of galaxies, in so-called
hierarchical structure formation (see [[Physical cosmology]]).

Press and Schechter observed that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects
more massive than some mass M is related to the fraction of volume samples
in which the smoothed initial density fluctuations are above some
density threshold.  This yields a formula for the mass function (distribution
of masses) of objects at any given time.

==Result==

The Press–Schechter formalism predicts that the number of objects with mass between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M+dM&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(M)dM = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{n}{3}\right)\frac{\bar{\rho}}{M^2}\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/6}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/3}\right)dM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean (baryonic and dark) matter density of the universe, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the early universe &lt;math&gt;P(k)\propto k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; is a critical mass above which structures will form.

Qualitatively, the prediction is that the mass distribution is a power law for
small masses, with an exponential cutoff above some characteristic mass that
increases with time.  Such functions had previously been noted by Schechter
as observed [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity functions]],
and are now known as Schechter luminosity functions.  The Press-Schechter
formalism provided the first quantitative model for how such functions might
arise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4370">In [[mathematics]], the '''quotient''' (also called '''Serre quotient''' or '''Gabriel quotient''') of an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; by a [[Serre subcategory]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is the abelian category ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' which, intuitively, is obtained from ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;'' by ignoring (i.e. treating as [[Zero-object|zero]]) all objects from ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.''  There is a canonical [[Exact functor|exact]] [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; whose kernel is ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;''.

== Definition ==
Formally, ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is the category whose objects are those of ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;'' and whose morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'' are given by the [[direct limit]] (of [[Abelian group|abelian groups]]) &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim \mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal A(X', Y/Y')&lt;/math&gt; over [[Subobject|subobjects]] &lt;math&gt;X' \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y' \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X/X'\in \cal{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y' \in \cal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  (Here, &lt;math&gt;X/X'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y/Y'&lt;/math&gt; denote [[Quotient object|quotient objects]] computed in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;''.) Composition of morphisms in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is induced by the universal property of the direct limit. 

The canonical functor &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; sends an object ''X'' to itself and a morphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding element of the direct limit with X'=X and Y'=0.

== Examples ==
Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] and consider the abelian category &lt;math&gt;{\rm Mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Vector space|vector spaces]] over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;{\rm mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt;of finite-[[Dimension|dimensional]] vector spaces is a Serre-subcategory of &lt;math&gt;{\rm Mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt;. The quotient &lt;math&gt;\cal{C}={\rm Mod}(k)/{\rm mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt; has as objects the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vector spaces, and the set of morphisms from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\cal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="block"&gt;\{k\text{-linear maps from } X\text{ to } Y\}/\{k\text{-linear maps from } X \text{ to } Y \text{ with finite-dimensional image}\}&lt;/math&gt;(which is a [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient of vector spaces]]).  This has the effect of identifying all finite-dimensional vector spaces with 0, and of identifying two linear maps whenever their difference has finite-dimensional image.

== Properties ==
The quotient ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is an abelian category, and the canonical functor &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Exact functor|exact]].   The kernel of  &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;Q(X)&lt;/math&gt;is a [[Zero-object|zero object]] of  ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;''. 

The quotient and canonical functor are characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if  ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;'' is any abelian category and &lt;math&gt;F \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is an exact functor such that &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a zero object of ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;'' for each object &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique exact functor &lt;math&gt;\overline{F} \colon \mathcal A/\mathcal B \to \mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F = \overline{F} \circ Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Pierre, ''[http://www.numdam.org/article/BSMF_1962__90__323_0.pdf Des categories abeliennes]'', Bull. Soc. Math. France '''90''' (1962), 323-448.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gabriel–Popescu ==
The [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]] states that any [[Grothendieck category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a quotient category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)/\cal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt;denotes the abelian category of right modules over some unital ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\cal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is some [[localizing subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=N.

In [[China|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n  and [[Southeast Asia]]n societies, a '''red envelope''', '''red packet''', '''''lì xì''''' (Vietnamese), '''''lai see''''' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), '''''âng-pau''''' ([[Hokkien]]) or '''''hóngbāo''''' ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]) is a monetary gift which is given during holidays or special occasions such as weddings, graduation or the birth of a baby.

Outside of China, similar customs have been adopted across parts of Southeast Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population. 

In China, the Chinese mobile app [[WeChat]] popularized the distribution of red envelopes in 2014 via [[mobile payments]] over the internet. This method of distributing red envelopes is now quite popular in the country.

==Usage==
Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as [[Chinese marriage|weddings]] or holidays such as [[Chinese New Year]]. The [[Color in Chinese culture|red color]] of the [[envelope]] symbolizes [[good luck]] and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called ''tao hongbao'' ({{zh|t=討紅包|hp=tǎo hóngbāo}}) or ''yao lishi'' ({{zh|t=要利是|hp=yào lì shì|links=no}}), and in the south of China, ''dou li shi'' ({{zh|t=逗利是|hp=dòu lì shì||cy=dau6 lai6 si6|links=no}}). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.

The amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, in accordance with [[Numbers in Chinese culture|Chinese beliefs]]; odd-numbered money gifts are traditionally associated with funerals.  The exception being the number 9 as it pronunciation of ''nine'' is homophonus to the word ''long'' and is the largest digit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fengshuiweb.co.uk/advice/angpow.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Still in some regions of China and in [[Chinese diaspora|its diaspora community]], odd numbers are favored for weddings because they are difficult to divide. There is also a widespread tradition that money should not be given in fours, or the number four should not appear in the amount, such as in 40, 400 and 444, as the pronunciation of the word ''four'' is homophonous to the word ''death''.

At wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. Amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.

During the Chinese New Year, in Southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried, most of whom are children. In northern and southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to the younger under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status, while in some regions red envelopes are only given to the young people without jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Students and future students in the sciences are typically rewarded handsomely&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of money is usually notes to avoid heavy coins and to make it difficult to judge the amount inside before opening. It is traditional to put brand new notes inside red envelopes and also to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy.

It is also given during the Chinese New Year in workplace from a person of authority (supervisors or owner of the business) out of his own fund to employees as a token of good fortune for the upcoming year.

In acting, it is also conventional to give an actor a red packet when he or she is to play a dead character, or pose for a picture for an obituary or a grave stone. 

Red packets are also used to deliver payment for favorable service to [[lion dance]] performers, religious practitioners, teachers, and doctors.

=== Digital red envelopes ===
During the Chinese New Year holiday in 2014, the [[mobile app|mobile]] [[instant messaging]] service [[WeChat]] introduced the ability to distribute virtual red envelopes of money to contacts and groups via its [[mobile payment]] platform. The feature became considerably popular, owing to its contemporary interpretation of the traditional practice, and a promotional giveaway held during the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], China's most-watched television special, where viewers could win red envelopes as prizes. Adoption of WeChat Pay saw a major increase following the launch, and two years later, over 32 billion virtual envelopes were sent over the Chinese New Year holiday in 600bc (itself a tenfold increase over 2015). The popularity spawned a "red envelope war" between WeChat owner [[Tencent]] and its historic rival, [[Alibaba Group]], which added a similar function to its competing messaging service and has held similar giveaway promotions, and imitations of the feature from other vendors.&lt;ref name="fastco-redpacket"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Social Cash Made WeChat The App For Everything|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|website=Fast Company|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Doug|title=Red envelope wars in China, Xiaomi eyes US|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chun|first1=Flora|last2=Lee|first2=Chun|title=Silicon Valley Startup Reinvents an Ancient Tradition: The Red Envelope|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1238540-silicon-valley-startup-reinvents-an-ancient-tradition-the-red-envelope/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Epoch Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts estimated that over 100 billion digital red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday in 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc-virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why this Chinese New Year will be a digital money fest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|title=Tencent, Alibaba Send Lunar New Year Revelers Money-Hunting - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In China, during the [[Qin Dynasty]], the elderly would thread coins with a red string. The money was referred to as "money warding off evil spirits" ({{zh|t=壓祟錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}) and was believed to protect the person of younger generation from sickness and death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The ''yasui qian'' was replaced by red envelopes when printing presses became more common and is now found written using the homophone for ''{{lang|zh|suì}}'' that means "old age" instead of "evil spirits" thus, "money warding off old age" ({{zh|t=壓歲錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}). Red envelopes continue to be referred to by such names today.

==Other customs==
Other similar traditions also exist in other countries in Asia. In [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and [[Cambodia]], the Chinese diaspora and immigrants have introduced the culture of red envelopes.

In Cambodia, red envelopes are called Ang Pav or Tae Ea(give Ang Pav). Ang Pav is delivered with best wishes from elder to younger generations. The money amount in Ang Pav makes young children happy and is a most important gift which traditionally reflects the best wishes as a symbol of good luck for the elders. Ang Pav can be presented in the day of Chinese New Year or "Saen Chen", when relatives gather together. The gift is kept as a worship item in or under the pillowcase, or somewhere else, especially near the bed of young while they are sleeping in New Year time. Gift in Ang Pav can be either money or a cheque, and more or less according to the charity of the donors.
The tradition of the delivery of Ang Pav traditionally descended from one generation to another a long time ago. Ang Pav will not be given to some one in family who has got a career, but this person has to, in return, deliver it to their parents and/or their younger children or siblings.
At weddings, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as help the newly married couple.

In Vietnam, red envelopes are considered to be lucky money and are typically given to children. They are generally given by the elders and adults, where a greeting or offering health and longevity is exchanged by the younger generation. Common greetings include "Sống lâu trăm tuổi", "An khang thịnh vượng" (安康興旺), "Vạn sự như ý" (萬事如意) and Sức khỏe dồi dào, which all relate back to the idea of wishing health and prosperity as age besets everyone in Vietnam on the Lunar New Year. The typical name for lucky money is lì xì or, less commonly, mừng tuổi.

In South Korea and Japan, a monetary gift is given to children by their relatives during the New Year period. In both countries, however, white envelopes are used instead of red, with the name of the receiver written on the back. A similar practice, [[Shūgi-bukuro]], is observed for Japanese weddings, but the envelope is folded rather than sealed, and decorated with an elaborate bow.

In the [[Philippines]], [[Chinese Filipino]]s exchange red envelopes (termed ''ang pao'') during the Lunar New Year, which is an easily recognisable symbol. The red envelope has gained wider acceptance among non-Chinese Filipinos, who have appropriated the custom for other occasions such as birthdays, and in giving monetary ''[[aguinaldo]]'' during [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]].

Red packets as a form of bribery in China's film industry were revealed in 2014's [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|Sony hack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox-Brewster|first1=Thomas|title=Inside Sony's Mysterious 'Red Pockets': Hackers Blow Open China Bribery Probe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/12/13/sony-pictures-hackers-reveal-mysterious-red-packets-payments-in-china/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green envelope===
{{Main|Green envelope}}
[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] Muslims in [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]] have adopted the Chinese custom of handing out monetary gifts in envelopes as part of their [[Eid al-Fitr]] ([[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]]: ''[[Hari Raya Aidilfitri]]'') celebrations, but instead of red packets, green envelopes are used. Customarily a family will have (usually small) amounts of money in green envelopes ready for [[Hospitality|visitors]], and may send them to friends and family unable to visit. [[Green#Religion|Green]] is used for its traditional association with [[Islam]], and the adaptation of the red envelope is based on the Muslim custom of ''[[sadaqah]]'', or voluntary charity. While present in the [[Qur'an]], ''sadaqah'' is much less formally established than the sometimes similar practice of ''[[zakat]]'', and in many cultures this takes a form closer to gift-giving and generosity among friends than charity in the strict sense, i.e. no attempt is made to give more to guests "in need", nor is it as a religious obligation as Islamic charity is often viewed.

===Purple envelope===
The tradition of ''ang pao'' has also been adopted by the local Indian Hindu populations of [[Indian Singaporeans|Singapore]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Malaysia]] for [[Diwali|Deepavali]]. They are known as ''Deepavali ang pow'' (in Malaysia), ''purple ang pow'' or simply ''ang pow'' (in Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;http://design-cu.jp/iasdr2013/papers/1893-1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow coloured envelopes for Deepavali have also been available at times in the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://chinesenewyearlanterns.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/uses-of-ang-pow-among-different-races.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developing countries have abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, including [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[biomass]], as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, [[electricity grid]] extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the [[diesel generator]]s that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as [[kerosene lamp]]s and [[biomass|traditional biomass]].&lt;ref name=reeee/&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small [[solar panel]]s, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewable energy==
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households
modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2198045 |title=Deploying Off-Grid Technology to Eradicate Energy Poverty |author=Sovacool, Benjamin K., |date=5 October 2012 |work=Science (vol. 338, 47-48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor= 20001554 |title= Energy in Developing Countries |last= McDonald |first= Paul |date= 1980 |journal= Area |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about [[global warming]] and [[air pollution]], reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.&lt;ref name=verlaw/&gt;

==Use of renewables==
Collectively, developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity. China and India are rapidly expanding markets for renewable energy. Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=ren9&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.&lt;ref name="reeee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Renew_Policies.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |author=IEA |year=2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author= Kevin Bullis |date= January 27, 2012 |work= Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them.&lt;ref name = re10/&gt;

===Poverty alleviation===
{{See also|Energy poverty}}
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

===Education===
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/grameen08 |title=Grameen Shakti installs efficient stoves as well as solar home systems |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
2.4 billion people use only traditional biomass, such as wood, residues and dung, for cooking and heating. The constant use of these types of energy sources exposes them to indoor particulate and carbon monoxide concentrations many times higher than [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards. "Traditional stoves using dung and charcoal emit large amounts of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Women and children suffer most, because they are exposed for the longest periods of time. Acute respiratory illnesses affect as much as 6% of the world population. The WHO estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull442/44204002429.pdf|title=IAEA BULLETIN, 44/2/2002|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants.

Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/kxn |title=PV-powered vaccine fridges |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

==Government policies==
{{Further|Renewable energy policy}}
More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading [[biofuel]]s industry, [[Renewable energy in China|China]], India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as [[small hydro]], small wind, biogas, and solar water heating.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;
However, policies like [[feed-in tariff]] are applied. Besides, with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the program called the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/adaptation_fund/items/3659.php Adaptation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large-scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/desalert/2009/WESS_overview_en.pdf|title=World Economic and Social Survey 2009 Promoting Development, Saving, 2009, the Planet|pages=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Renewable Energy in the Philippines}}
[[File:Bangui Wind Mills.JPG|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]] The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. the Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/14/11/philippines-lifts-2030-renewable-energy-target&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://samueldalsanto.com/2012/04/14/samuel-helps-philippines-wind-power-project-get-presidential-approval/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbiz.asia/story/policy-problems-hamper-philippine-renewables-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Kenya}}
In [[Kenya]], the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Energy http://www.energy.go.ke/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of renewable energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the [[feed-in tariff]] policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/feed%20in%20tarriffs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"/&gt; The only other country in Africa utilising geothermal power is [[Ethiopia]].

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans are turning to solar power every year rather than making connections to the country’s electric grid. This is due to the high connectivity costs and the fact that there is an abundance of solar power in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renewable energy]] accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/12/brazils-wind-power-auction-spurs-more-clean-energy-development.html Renewable energy in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|sugarcane ethanol]]. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.&lt;ref name="ANP07_2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|title=ANP: consumo de álcool combustível é 50% maior em 2007|author=Agência Brasil|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Invertia|accessdate=2008-08-09|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226014527/http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|archivedate=2008-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/economia/gabrielli-etanol-reduzira-mercado-de-gasolina-a-17-ate-2020 90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16713">'''Righteousness''' is defined as "the quality of being morally correct and justifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered synonymous with "rightness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rightness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[concept]] that can be found in Dharmic traditions and Abrahamic traditions as a theological concept. For example, from various perspectives in [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]] it is considered an [[Property_(philosophy)|attribute]] that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been "judged" or "reckoned" as leading a life that is pleasing to God.. It is also found in [[Tamil language|tamil literature]]  in the name of அறம்(aram).Tamil Custom known for it's righteousness.In Tamil literature there is separate section called [[அற நூல்கள்]] righteous books for example [[thirukkural]] [[Nālaṭiyār|nalatiyar]] and many more books.[[tirukkural]] dedicated 1-38 chapters [[Book of Virtues|Book of aram]] for righteousness.A poem in [[purananuru]] written by [[Kaniyan Pungundranar|kaniyanpoongundranar]] it showcases the practice of righteousness leads to [[World peace|worldpeace]] and harmony in society.

[[William Tyndale]] ([[Tyndale Bible|Bible translator]] into English in 1526) remodelled the word after an earlier word ''rihtwis'', which would have yielded [[modern English]] *''rightwise'' or *''rightways''. He used it to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root צדקים (''TzDYQ''), ''[[Tzadik|tzedek]]'', which appears over five hundred times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|δίκαιος}} (''dikaios''), which appears more than two hundred times in the [[New Testament]].

==Philosophy, history, linguistics, meanings, and translation==
In the word "righteousness," the suffix "-ness" modifies the adjective "righteous," which is "right" modified by "-ous." Righteousness is a [[phenomenon]] or state or condition of: resembling or displaying the nature of moral, good, correct, true, factual, excellent, just, virtuous, natural, morally upright, correct for situations, balanced, and honorable being or being in such a state. 

Origin
Old English rihtwīs, from riht ‘right’ + wīs ‘manner, state, condition’ (as opposed to ''wrangwise'', "wrongful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=78|year=1855|issue=6|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The change in the ending in the 16th century was due to association with words such as bounteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteous|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics or moral philosophy==
Ethics is a major branch of philosophy, encompasses right conduct and good living.
" Rushworth Kidder states that "standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'".[3] Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".[4] The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word [[Ethics#Defining_ethics|ethics]] is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."

==Connections of concepts in world history==
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|Attributes of]] [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible.
"[[Eusebeia]]" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as "godliness," a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker,[34] on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’, 'laws of nature' and ‘path of ''rightness''’.

"The word εὐσέβεια as it is used in the Greek New Testament carries the meaning of "godliness", and is distinct from θρησκεία (thrēskeia), "religion". Eusebeia relates to real, true, vital, and spiritual relation with God, while thrēskeia relates to the outward acts of religious observances or ceremonies, which can be performed by the flesh. The English word "religion" was never used in the sense of true godliness. It always meant the outward forms of worship. In 1Ti 3:16, the Mystery, or secret connected with true Christianity as distinct from religion, it is the Genitive of relation. (This specific meaning occurs only in Act 3:12.)] This word arises in the Greek New Testament in 1 Tim 2:2, 1 Tim 3:16, 1 Tim 4:7, 1 Tim 4:8, 1 Tim 6:3, 1 Tim 6:5, 1 Tim 6:6, 1 Tim 6:11, 2 Tim 3:5, Tit 1:1, 2 Pt 1:3, 2 Pt 1:6, 2 Pt 1:7, 2 Pt 3:11.[7]"

==Yi (Confucianism)==
{{main article|Yi (Confucianism)}}
[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yi]], (Chinese: 義; simplified Chinese: 义; traditional Chinese: 義; pinyin: yì; Jyutping: Ji6; Zhuyin Fuhao: ㄧˋ), literally "justice, righteousness; meaning," is an important concept in Confucianism. It involves a moral disposition to do good, and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently. Yi resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (ren) and skillful practice (li). Yi represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply virtues "with no loss of sight of the total good. Yi represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." 

  In application, yi is a "complex principle" which includes:
    skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
    the wise recognition of such fitness
    the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.

==Dharmic traditions==

Dharma is a key concept with multiple meanings. There might not be a [[Untranslatability|single-word translation]] for dharma in Western languages. ''Dharma'' धर्म  can be translated as righteousness, religion, faith, duty, law, and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of dharma include rightness, good, natural, morality, righteousness, and virtue. It means moral, right, just, balanced, or natural etc. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’ and ‘path of ''rightness''’. Dharma encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or ''morally upright''. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to satya (truth, Sanskrit: satya सत्यं). "...when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one." — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.xiv

In Hindu philosophy and/or religion, major emphasis is placed on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27136.htm|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Including duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’. The Sanskrit epics contain themes and examples where right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. 

In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In his 250 BCE Edicts used the word "[[eusebeia]]" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of "dharma". This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[34] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of ''right,'' of ''good'', of one’s duty.

For Sikhs, the word Dharm means the path of ''righteousness'' and proper religious practice.

The major Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra mentions Das-dharma with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues".

==Judaism==
{{Attributes of God}}
{{main|Tzadik}}
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes]] of [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Its chief meaning concerns [[ethics|ethical]] conduct (for example, [[Leviticus]] 19:36; [[Deuteronomy]] 25:1; [[Psalm]] 1:6; [[Proverb]]s 8:20). In the [[Book of Job]] the title character is introduced to us as a person who is perfect in righteousness.

==Christianity==
{{see also|Sola fide|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
{{External links|section|date=July 2018}}
The New Testament continues the Hebrew Bible's tradition of the ethical ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:10}}) and legal ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:4}}) aspects of righteousness. [[William Lane Craig]] argues that we should think of God as the paradigm, the locus, the source of all righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 19)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-19|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's gospel contains the most utterances of the word. In Matthew's account of the baptism encounter Jesus tells the prophet "it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" as Jesus requests that John perform the rite for him. The Sermon of the Mount contains the memorable commandment "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness". The Greek word ''dikaiosune'' also means justice&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert. (May 2011) Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible. p. 819. {{ISBN|978-1-56563-810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sole translation using this rendering for [[Matthew 6:33]] is the [[New English Bible]].

Jesus asserts the importance of righteousness by saying in Matthew 5:20, "For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." Jesus also re-affirms the [[Law of Moses|Laws of Moses]] by saying in Matthew 5:19, "Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

However, [[Paul the Apostle]] speaks of [[dual-covenant theology|two ways]], at least in theory, to achieve righteousness: through the [[Law of Moses]] (or [[Torah]]); and through [[faith]] in the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] made possible through the death and [[resurrection]] of Jesus Christ ({{bibleverse||Romans|10:3-13}}). Some interpret that he repeatedly emphasizes that faith is the only effective way. Reference ({{bibleverse||Romans|4:5}}). ({{bibleverse||Romans|3:21-24}}). For example, just a few verses earlier, he states the Jews did not attain the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith, but by works ({{bibleverse||Romans|9:30-33}}). The New Testament speaks of a salvation founded on God's righteousness, as exemplified throughout the history of salvation narrated in the [[Old Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|9-11}}).
Paul writes to the Romans that righteousness comes by faith: "...a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'" ({{bibleverse||Romans|1:17}})

In [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209&amp;version=NRSV II Cor. 9:9] the New Revised Standard Version has a footnote that the original word has the meaning of 'benevolence' and the Messianic Jewish commentary of David Stern affirms the Jewish practice of 'doing ''tzedakah''' as charity in referring to the Matt. 6 and II Cor. 9 passages.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H. (1992) Jewish New Testament Commentary: A companion volume to the 'Jewish New Testament'. p. 30 and p. 512. {{ISBN|965-359-008-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{bibleverse||James|2:14-26}} speaks of the relationship between works of righteousness and faith, saying that "faith without works is dead." Righteous acts according to James include [[Good works|works of charity]] ({{bibleverse||James|2:15-16}}) as well as avoiding [[Christian views on sin|sins]] against the Law of Moses ({{bibleverse||James|2:11-12}}).

{{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7-8}} describes [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] as a righteous man.

===Type of saint===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], "Righteous" is a [[List of Eastern Orthodox saint titles|type of saint]] who is regarded as a holy person under the [[Old Covenant]] (Old Testament Israel) but also sometimes used for married saints of the [[New Covenant]] (the Church). According to [[Orthodox theology]], the Righteous saints of the Old Covenant were not able to enter into heaven until after the [[death of Jesus]] on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|11:40|KJV}}), but had to await salvation in the [[Bosom of Abraham]] (see: [[Harrowing of Hell]]).

==Islam==
Righteousness is mentioned several times in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wefound.org/texts/Islam_files/IslamRighteousness.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an says that a life of righteousness is the only way to go to Heaven.
{{quote|We will give the home of the Hereafter to those who do not want arrogance or mischief on earth; and the end is best for the righteous.| Qur’an Sura 28: Verse 83}}

{{quote|O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).| Qur'an Surah 49: Verse 13}}

{{quote|Righteousness is not that you turn your faces to the east and the west [in prayer].  But righteous is the one who believes in God, the Last Day, the Angels, the Scripture and the Prophets; who gives his wealth in spite of love for it to kinsfolk, orphans, the poor, the wayfarer, to those who ask and to set slaves free.  And (righteous are) those who pray, pay alms, honor their agreements, and are patient in (times of) poverty, ailment and during conflict.  Such are the people of truth.  And they are the God-Fearing.| Qur'an Surah 2: Verse 177}}

The literal translation of the [[Latin]] "'''''salva veritate'''''" is "with (or by) unharmed truth", using [[ablative|ablative of manner]]: "''salva''" meaning "rescue," "salvation," or "welfare," and "''veritate''" meaning "reality" or "truth". Thus, ''Salva veritate'' (or '''intersubstitutivity''') is the logical condition by which two expressions may be interchanged without altering the [[truth-value]] of statements in which the expressions occur. Substitution ''salva veritate'' is not possible in [[opaque context]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L.T.F. Gamut, ''Logic, Language and Meaning'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leibniz ==

The phrase occurs in two fragments from [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''General Science. Characteristics'':

* In Chapter 19, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Two terms are the same (''eadem'') if one can be substituted for the other ''without altering the truth of any statement'' (''salva veritate'')."
* In Chapter 20, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Terms which can be substituted for one another wherever we please ''without altering the truth of any statement'' (''salva veritate''), are the same (''eadem'') or coincident (''coincidentia''). For example, '[[triangle]]' and 'trilateral', for in every proposition demonstrated by [[Euclid]] concerning 'triangle', 'trilateral' can be substituted ''without loss of [[truth]]'' (''salva veritate'')."

==Quine==

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] takes substitutivity ''salva veritate'' to be the same as the "indiscernibility of identicals". Given a true statement, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to show that depending on context, the statement may change in value, In fact, the whole [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[modal logic]] of necessity is dependent on context and empty otherwise; for it collapses if [[essence]] is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, pp. 356–357&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the statements:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (1)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione = Barbarelli,
|-
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (2)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione was so-called because of his size
|}
are true;  however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | &amp;nbsp;
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's example here refers to [[Giorgio Barbarelli]]'s [[sobriquet]] "Giorgione", an Italian name roughly glossed as "Big George."

'''Symbiogenesis''', or '''endosymbiotic theory''', is an evolutionary theory of the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] from [[prokaryote|prokaryotic organisms]], first articulated in 1905 and 1910 by the [[Russians|Russian]] botanist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]], and advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. It holds that the [[organelle]]s distinguishing eukaryote cells evolved through [[symbiosis]] of individual single-celled prokaryotes ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]).

The theory holds that [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells represent formerly free-living prokaryotes taken one inside the other in [[endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]]. In more detail, mitochondria appear to be related to [[Rickettsiales]] [[proteobacteria]], and chloroplasts to nitrogen-fixing filamentous [[cyanobacteria]].

Among the many lines of evidence supporting symbiogenesis are that new mitochondria and plastids are formed only through [[binary fission]], and that cells cannot create new ones otherwise; that the [[transport protein]]s called [[porin (protein)|porins]] are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacterial cell membranes; that [[cardiolipin]] is found only in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes; and that some mitochondria and plastids contain single circular DNA molecules similar to the chromosomes of bacteria.

The theory of symbiogenesis (from [[Ancient Greek |Greek]]: σύν ''syn'' "together", βίος ''bios'' "life", and γένεσις ''genesis'' "origin, birth") was first outlined by the [[Russians|Russian]] botanist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] in his 1905 work, ''The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom'', and then elaborated in his 1910 ''The Theory of Two Plasms as the Basis of Symbiogenesis, a New Study of the Origins of Organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mereschkowski, K. |authorlink=Konstantin Mereschkowski |title=Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche |trans-title=On the nature and origin of chromatophores in the plant kingdom |journal=Biologisches Centralblatt  |date=15 September 1905 |volume=25 |issue=18 |pages=593–604 |language=German |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822009245838;view=1up;seq=603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

The spores receive from the mother plant chlorophyll granules, which create, by division, all of the chlorophyll granules of the plants that arises from them [i.e., the spores]. This finding in algae made it seem likely to Prof. Schmitz that the higher plants would behave likewise.) From p. 106: ''"Meine Untersuchungen haben ergeben, … aus dem Scheitelmeristem sich entwickelnden Gewebe erzeugen."'' (My investigations have revealed that the vegetation points [i.e., points of vegetative growth] always contain differentiated chlorophyll bodies or their colorless rudiments; that they arise not by creation from the cell plasma, but from one another by division, and that they create all chlorophyll bodies and starch-forming [bodies] of the tissues developing from the apical meristem.) From p. 112, footnote 2: ''"Sollte es sich definitiv bestätigen, … an eine Symbiose erinnern."'' (If it should definitely be confirmed that the plastids in egg cells are not formed anew, then their relation to the organism containing them would somewhat suggest a symbiosis.)

Comparisons with their closest free living cyanobacteria of the genus ''[[Synechococcus]]'' (having a genome size 3 Mb, with 3300 genes) revealed that chromatophores underwent a drastic genome shrinkage. Chromatophores contained genes that were accountable for [[photosynthesis]] but were deficient in genes that could carry out other biosynthetic functions; this observation suggests that these endosymbiotic cells are highly dependent on their hosts for their survival and growth mechanisms. Thus, these chromatophores were found to be non-functional for organelle-specific purposes when compared to mitochondria and plastids. This distinction could have promoted the early [[evolution]] of photosynthetic organelles.

The loss of genetic autonomy, that is, the loss of many genes from endosymbionts, occurred very early in evolutionary time.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why are plastid genomes retained in non-photosynthetic organisms? |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S136013850500302X/abstract|journal=Trends in Plant Science |date=2006 |pmid=16406301 |pages=101–108 |volume=11|issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.12.004 |first=Adrian C.|last=Barbrook |first2=Christopher J. |last2=Howe |first3=Saul |last3=Purton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the entire original endosymbiont genome, there are three main possible fates for genes over evolutionary time.

The mechanisms of gene transfer are not fully known; however, multiple hypotheses exist to explain this phenomenon. The [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] hypothesis involves the use of [[messenger RNA]] (mRNAs) to transport genes from organelles to the nucleus where they are converted to cDNA and incorporated into the genome.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; The cDNA hypothesis is based on studies of the genomes of flowering plants. Protein coding RNAs in mitochondria are spliced and edited using organelle-specific splice and editing sites. Nuclear copies of some mitochondrial genes, however, do not contain organelle-specific splice sites, suggesting a processed mRNA intermediate. The cDNA hypothesis has since been revised as edited mitochondrial cDNAs are unlikely to recombine with the nuclear genome and are more likely to recombine with their native mitochondrial genome. If the edited mitochondrial sequence recombines with the mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial splice sites would no longer exist in the mitochondrial genome. Any subsequent nuclear gene transfer would therefore also lack mitochondrial splice sites.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;

The bulk flow hypothesis is the alternative to the cDNA hypothesis, stating that escaped DNA, rather than mRNA, is the mechanism of gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; According to this hypothesis, disturbances to organelles, including [[autophagy]] (normal cell destruction), [[gametogenesis]] (the formation of gametes), and cell stress, release DNA which is imported into the nucleus and incorporated into the nuclear DNA using [[non-homologous end joining]] (repair of double stranded breaks).&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; For example, in the initial stages of endosymbiosis, due to a lack of major gene transfer, the host cell had little to no control over the endosymbiont. The endosymbiont underwent cell division independently of the host cell, resulting in many "copies" of the endosymbiont within the host cell. Some of the endosymbionts [[lysis|lysed]] (burst), and high levels of DNA were incorporated into the nucleus. A similar mechanism is thought to occur in tobacco plants, which show a high rate of gene transfer and whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; In addition, the bulk flow hypothesis is also supported by the presence of non-random clusters of organelle genes, suggesting the simultaneous movement of multiple genes.&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt;

==Organellar genomes==

===Plastomes and mitogenomes===
[[File:Map of the human mitochondrial genome.svg|thumb|The [[Human mitochondrial genetics|human mitochondrial genome]] has retained genes encoding 2 [[rRNA]]s, 22 [[tRNA]]s, and 13 redox [[protein]]s.]]

The third and final possible fate of endosymbiont genes is that they remain in the organelles. Plastids and mitochondria, although they have lost much of their genomes, retain genes encoding rRNAs, tRNAs, proteins involved in redox reactions, and proteins required for transcription, translation, and replication.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; There are many hypotheses to explain why organelles retain a small portion of their genome; however no one hypothesis will apply to all organisms&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; and the topic is still quite controversial.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt; The hydrophobicity hypothesis states that highly [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (water hating) proteins (such as the membrane bound proteins involved in [[redox]] reactions) are not easily transported through the cytosol and therefore these proteins must be encoded in their respective organelles.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The code disparity hypothesis states that the limit on transfer is due to differing genetic codes and RNA editing between the organelle and the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The redox control hypothesis states that genes encoding redox reaction proteins are retained in order to effectively couple the need for repair and the synthesis of these proteins.&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; For example, if one of the [[photosystem]]s is lost from the plastid, the intermediate electron carriers may lose or gain too many electrons, signalling the need for repair of a photosystem.&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt; The time delay involved in signalling the nucleus and transporting a cytosolic protein to the organelle results in the production of damaging [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; The final hypothesis states that the assembly of membrane proteins, particularly those involved in redox reactions, requires coordinated synthesis and assembly of subunits; however, translation and protein transport coordination is more difficult to control in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;

===Non-photosynthetic plastid genomes===
The majority of the genes in the mitochondria and plastids are related to the expression (transcription, translation and replication) of genes encoding proteins involved in either photosynthesis (in plastids) or cellular respiration (in mitochondria).&lt;ref name="Timmis2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LilaKoumandou2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; One might predict that the loss of photosynthesis or cellular respiration would allow for the complete loss of the plastid genome or the mitochondrial genome respectively.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; While there are numerous examples of mitochondrial descendants ([[mitosome]]s and [[hydrogenosome]]s) that have lost their entire organellar genome,&lt;ref name="Howe2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howe  |first=Christopher J. |title=Cellular Evolution: What's in a Mitochondrion? |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982208004417/abstract |journal=Current Biology |pmid=18492476 |pages=R429-R431 |volume=18 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.007 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-photosynthetic plastids tend to retain a small genome.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; There are two main hypotheses to explain this occurrence:

The essential tRNA hypothesis notes that there have been no documented functional plastid-to-nucleus gene transfers of genes encoding RNA products (tRNAs and rRNAs). As a result, plastids must make their own functional RNAs or import nuclear counterparts. The genes encoding tRNA-Glu and tRNA-fmet, however, appear to be indispensable. The plastid is responsible for [[heme|haem]] biosynthesis, which requires plastid encoded tRNA-Glu (from the gene trnE) as a precursor molecule. Like other genes encoding RNAs, trnE cannot be transferred to the nucleus. In addition, it is unlikely trnE could be replaced by a cytosolic tRNA-Glu as trnE is highly conserved; single base changes in trnE have resulted in the loss of haem synthesis. The gene for tRNA-[[N-Formylmethionine|formylmethionine]] (tRNA-fmet) is also encoded in the plastid genome and is required for translation initiation in both plastids and mitochondria. A plastid is required to continue expressing the gene for tRNA-fmet so long as the mitochondrion is translating proteins.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;

The limited window hypothesis offers a more general explanation for the retention of genes in non-photosynthetic plastids.&lt;ref name="Lane2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Nick |title=Plastids, Genomes, and the Probability of Gene Transfer|url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/372 |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |date=2011 |pmc=3101016 |pmid=21292628 |pages=372–374|volume=3|doi=10.1093/gbe/evr003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bulk flow hypothesis, genes are transferred to the nucleus following the disturbance of organelles.&lt;ref name="Leister2005"/&gt; Disturbance was common in the early stages of endosymbiosis, however, once the host cell gained control of organelle division, eukaryotes could evolve to have only one plastid per cell. Having only one plastid severely limits gene transfer&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt; as the lysis of the single plastid would likely result in cell death.&lt;ref name="Barbrook2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane2011"/&gt; Consistent with this hypothesis, organisms with multiple plastids show an 80-fold increase in plastid-to-nucleus gene transfer compared to organisms with single plastids.&lt;ref name="Lane2011"/&gt;

==Secondary endosymbiosis==
Primary endosymbiosis involves the engulfment of a cell by another free living organism. Secondary endosymbiosis occurs when the product of primary endosymbiosis is itself engulfed and retained by another free living eukaryote. Secondary endosymbiosis has occurred several times and has given rise to extremely diverse groups of algae and other eukaryotes. Some organisms can take opportunistic advantage of a similar process, where they engulf an alga and use the products of its photosynthesis, but once the prey item dies (or is lost) the host returns to a free living state. Obligate secondary endosymbionts become dependent on their organelles and are unable to survive in their absence (for a review see McFadden 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadden, G. I. |title=Primary and secondary endosymbiosis and the origin of plastids |journal=J Phycol |year=2001 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=951–9 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.01126.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[RedToL]], the Red Algal Tree of Life Initiative funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] highlights the role [[red algae]] or [[Rhodophyta]] played in the evolution of our planet through secondary endosymbiosis.

One possible secondary endosymbiosis in process has been observed by Okamoto &amp; Inouye (2005). The heterotrophic protist ''[[Hatena arenicola|Hatena]]'' behaves like a predator until it ingests a [[green alga]], which loses its flagella and cytoskeleton, while ''Hatena'', now a host, switches to photosynthetic nutrition, gains the ability to move towards light and loses its feeding apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Okamoto |first1=Noriko |last2=Inouye |first2=Isao |title=A Secondary Symbiosis in Progress? |journal=Science |date=2005 |volume=310 |issue=5746 |page=287 |doi=10.1126/science.1116125 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noriko_Okamoto2/publication/7542363_A_secondary_symbiosis_in_progress/links/09e4150b3f3ec0238d000000.pdf |accessdate=15 February 2015 |pmid=16224014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of secondary endosymbiosis left its evolutionary signature within the unique topography of plastid membranes. Secondary plastids are surrounded by three (in [[euglenophyte]]s and some [[dinoflagellate]]s) or four membranes (in [[haptophyte]]s, [[heterokont]]s, [[Cryptomonad|cryptophytes]], and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s). The two additional membranes are thought to correspond to the plasma membrane of the engulfed alga and the phagosomal membrane of the host cell. The endosymbiotic acquisition of a eukaryote cell is represented in the cryptophytes; where the remnant nucleus of the red algal symbiont (the [[nucleomorph]]) is present between the two inner and two outer plastid membranes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Despite the diversity of organisms containing plastids, the morphology, biochemistry, genomic organisation, and molecular phylogeny of plastid RNAs and proteins suggest a single origin of all extant plastids – although this theory is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=McFadden, G. I.; van Dooren, G. G. |title=Evolution: red algal genome affirms a common origin of all plastids |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=14 |issue=13 |pages=R514–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15242632 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.041 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982204004464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gould, SB, Waller, RF, McFadden, GI |title=Plastid evolution |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=491–517 |year=2008 |pmid=18315522 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092915 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092915?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species including ''[[Pediculus humanus]]'' (lice) have multiple chromosomes in the mitochondrion. This and the phylogenetics of the genes encoded within the mitochondrion suggest that mitochondria have multiple ancestors, that these were acquired by endosymbiosis on several occasions rather than just once, and that there have been extensive mergers and rearrangements of genes on the several original mitochondrial chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Georgiades, K. |author2=Raoult, D. |year=2011|title=The rhizome of ''Reclinomonas americana'', ''Homo sapiens'', ''Pediculus humanus'' and ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' mitochondria|url=http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/55|journal=Biology Direct|volume=6|page=55|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date ==
The question of when the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic form occurred and when the first crown-group eukaryotes appeared on earth is still unresolved. The oldest known body fossils that can be positively assigned to the Eukaryota are acanthomorphic [[acritarch]]s from the 1631±1 Ma Deonar Formation of India (lower Vindhyan Supergroup) of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Prasad |first=Pijai |date=August 2005 |title=Organic-walled microfossils from the Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup of Son Valley, Madhya Pradesh, India |url=http://14.139.63.228:8080/pbrep/bitstream/123456789/1084/1/PbV54_13.pdf |journal=Paleobotanist |volume=54 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fossils can still be identiﬁed as derived post-nuclear eukaryotes with a sophisticated, morphology-generating [[cytoskeleton]] sustained by mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butterfield |first=Nicholas J. |date=2014-11-26 |title=Early evolution of the Eukaryota |url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/pala.12139 |journal=Palaeontology |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1111/pala.12139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fossil evidence indicates that endosymbiotic acquisition of [[alphaproteobacteria]] must have occurred before 1.6 Ga. Molecular clocks have also been used to estimate the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA, however these methods have large inherent uncertainty and give a wide range of dates.

In [[abstract algebra]], the set of all [[partial bijection]]s on a set ''X'' ({{aka}} one-to-one partial transformations) forms an [[inverse semigroup]], called the '''symmetric inverse semigroup'''&lt;ref name="Grillet1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre A. Grillet|title=Semigroups: An Introduction to the Structure Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM544W1N2UUC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9662-4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; (actually a [[monoid]]) on ''X''. The conventional notation for the symmetric inverse semigroup on a set ''X'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollings 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;252&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{IS}_X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganyushkin and Mazorchuk 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;v&lt;/ref&gt; In general &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_X&lt;/math&gt; is not [[Commutative semigroup|commutative]].

Details about the origin of the symmetric inverse semigroup are available in the discussion on the [[Inverse_semigroup#Origins|origins of the inverse semigroup]].

==Finite symmetric inverse semigroups==
When ''X'' is a finite set {1, ..., ''n''}, the inverse semigroup of one-one partial transformations is denoted by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its elements are called '''charts''' or '''partial symmetries'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of chart generalizes the notion of [[permutation]]. A (famous) example of (sets of) charts are the hypomorphic mapping sets from the [[reconstruction conjecture]] in graph theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cycle notation]] of classical, group-based permutations generalizes to symmetric inverse semigroups by the addition of a notion called a ''path'', which (unlike a cycle) ends when it reaches the [[Partial_function#In_category_theory|"undefined" element]]; the notation thus extended is called ''path notation''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''unicity''' explains that each event, each living being, each object, each person or each circumstance has the characteristic of its [[uniqueness]], of its particularity. Other similar events, living beings, objects, persons or circumstances may exist, but never the same entity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webdianoia.com/glosario/display.php?action=view&amp;id=329&amp;from=action=search%7Cby=U&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12715">In [[mathematics]], a '''vector-valued differential form''' on a [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[differential form]] on ''M'' with values in a [[vector space]] ''V''. More generally, it is a differential form with values in some [[vector bundle]] ''E'' over ''M''. Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as '''R'''-valued differential forms.

An important case of vector-valued differential forms are [[Lie algebra-valued forms]]. (A [[connection form]] is an example of such a form.)

==Formal definition==

Let ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and ''E'' → ''M'' be a smooth [[vector bundle]] over ''M''. We denote the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth section]]s of a bundle ''E'' by Γ(''E''). An '''''E''-valued differential form''' of degree ''p'' is a smooth section of the [[tensor product bundle]] of ''E'' with Λ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt; ∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), the ''p''-th [[exterior power]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''. The space of such forms is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M,E) = \Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^pT^*M).&lt;/math&gt;
Because Γ is a [[strong monoidal functor]],&lt;ref name=gamma_monoidal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global sections of a tensor product of vector bundles on a smooth manifold|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/492166/global-sections-of-a-tensor-product-of-vector-bundles-on-a-smooth-manifold|website=math.stackexchange.com|accessdate=27 October 2014|ref=monoidal}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can also be interpreted as
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^pT^*M) = \Gamma(E) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Gamma(\Lambda^pT^*M) = \Gamma(E) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M),&lt;/math&gt;
where the latter two tensor products are the [[tensor product of modules]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') of smooth '''R'''-valued functions on ''M'' (see the seventh example [[module (mathematics)#Examples|here]]).  By convention, an ''E''-valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle ''E''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^0(M,E) = \Gamma(E).\,&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, an ''E''-valued differential form can be defined as a [[vector bundle morphism|bundle morphism]]
:&lt;math&gt;TM\otimes\cdots\otimes TM \to E&lt;/math&gt;
which is totally [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]].

Let ''V'' be a fixed [[vector space]]. A '''''V''-valued differential form''' of degree ''p'' is a differential form of degree ''p'' with values in the [[trivial bundle]] ''M'' &amp;times; ''V''. The space of such forms is denoted Ω&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', ''V''). When ''V'' = '''R''' one recovers the definition of an ordinary differential form.  If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then one can show that the natural homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M) \otimes_\mathbb{R} V \to \Omega^p(M,V),&lt;/math&gt;
where the first tensor product is of vector spaces over '''R''', is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: One can verify this for ''p''=0 by turning a basis for ''V'' into a set of constant functions to ''V'', which allows the construction of an inverse to the above homomorphism.  The general case can be proved by noting that
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M, V) = \Omega^0(M, V) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M),&lt;/math&gt;
and that because &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-ring of Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') via the constant functions,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^0(M, V) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M) = (V \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Omega^0(M)) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M) = V \otimes_\mathbb{R} (\Omega^0(M) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M)) = V \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Omega^p(M).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations on vector-valued forms==

===Pullback===

One can define the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of vector-valued forms by [[smooth map]]s just as for ordinary forms. The pullback of an ''E''-valued form on ''N'' by a smooth map φ : ''M'' → ''N'' is an (φ*''E'')-valued form on ''M'', where φ*''E'' is the [[pullback bundle]] of ''E'' by φ.

The formula is given just as in the ordinary case. For any ''E''-valued ''p''-form ω on ''N'' the pullback φ*ω is given by
:&lt;math&gt; (\varphi^*\omega)_x(v_1,\cdots, v_p) = \omega_{\varphi(x)}(\mathrm d\varphi_x(v_1),\cdots,\mathrm d\varphi_x(v_p)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Wedge product===

Just as for ordinary differential forms, one can define a [[wedge product]] of vector-valued forms. The wedge product of an ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-valued ''p''-form with an ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-valued ''q''-form is naturally an (''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;otimes;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-valued (''p''+''q'')-form:
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge : \Omega^p(M,E_1) \times \Omega^q(M,E_2) \to \Omega^{p+q}(M,E_1\otimes E_2).&lt;/math&gt;
The definition is just as for ordinary forms with the exception that real multiplication is replaced with the [[tensor product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(\omega\wedge\eta)(v_1,\cdots,v_{p+q}) = \frac{1}{(p + q)!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{p+q}}\sgn(\sigma)\omega(v_{\sigma(1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p)})\otimes \eta(v_{\sigma(p+1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p+q)}).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the wedge product of an ordinary ('''R'''-valued) ''p''-form with an ''E''-valued ''q''-form is naturally an ''E''-valued (''p''+''q'')-form (since the tensor product of ''E'' with the trivial bundle ''M'' &amp;times; '''R''' is [[naturally isomorphic]] to ''E''). For ω ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') and η ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', ''E'') one has the usual commutativity relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta = (-1)^{pq}\eta\wedge\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the wedge product of two ''E''-valued forms is ''not'' another ''E''-valued form, but rather an (''E''&amp;otimes;''E'')-valued form. However, if ''E'' is an [[algebra bundle]] (i.e. a bundle of [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s rather than just vector spaces) one can compose with multiplication in ''E'' to obtain an ''E''-valued form. If ''E'' is a bundle of [[commutative algebra|commutative]], [[associative algebra]]s then, with this modified wedge product, the set of all ''E''-valued differential forms
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega(M,E) = \bigoplus_{p=0}^{\dim M}\Omega^p(M,E)&lt;/math&gt;
becomes a [[graded-commutative]] associative algebra. If the fibers of ''E'' are not commutative then Ω(''M'',''E'') will not be graded-commutative.

===Exterior derivative===

For any vector space ''V'' there is a natural [[exterior derivative]] on the space of ''V''-valued forms. This is just the ordinary exterior derivative acting component-wise relative to any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of ''V''. Explicitly, if {''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;} is a basis for ''V'' then the differential of a ''V''-valued ''p''-form ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = (d\omega^\alpha)e_\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The exterior derivative on ''V''-valued forms is completely characterized by the usual relations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;d(\omega+\eta) = d\omega + d\eta\\
&amp;d(\omega\wedge\eta) = d\omega\wedge\eta + (-1)^p\,\omega\wedge d\eta\qquad(p=\deg\omega)\\
&amp;d(d\omega) = 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, the above remarks apply to ''E''-valued forms where ''E'' is any [[flat vector bundle]] over ''M'' (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are constant). The exterior derivative is defined as above on any [[local trivialization]] of ''E''.

If ''E'' is not flat then there is no natural notion of an exterior derivative acting on ''E''-valued forms. What is needed is a choice of [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] on ''E''. A connection on ''E'' is a linear [[differential operator]] taking sections of ''E'' to ''E''-valued one forms:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla : \Omega^0(M,E) \to \Omega^1(M,E).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''E'' is equipped with a connection ∇ then there is a unique [[covariant exterior derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;d_\nabla: \Omega^p(M,E) \to \Omega^{p+1}(M,E)&lt;/math&gt;
extending ∇. The covariant exterior derivative is characterized by [[linearity]] and the equation
:&lt;math&gt;d_\nabla(\omega\wedge\eta) = d_\nabla\omega\wedge\eta + (-1)^p\,\omega\wedge d\eta&lt;/math&gt;
where ω is a ''E''-valued ''p''-form and η is an ordinary ''q''-form. In general, one need not have ''d''&lt;sub&gt;∇&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. In fact, this happens if and only if the connection ∇ is flat (i.e. has vanishing [[curvature form|curvature]]).

==Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles==

Let ''E'' → ''M'' be a smooth vector bundle of rank ''k'' over ''M'' and let ''π'' : F(''E'') → ''M'' be the ([[associated bundle|associated]]) [[frame bundle]] of ''E'', which is a [[principal bundle|principal]] GL&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') bundle over ''M''. The [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of ''E'' by ''π'' is canonically isomorphic to F(''E'') &amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; via the inverse of [''u'', ''v''] →''u''(''v''), where ρ is the standard representation. Therefore, the pullback by ''π'' of an ''E''-valued form on ''M'' determines an '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued form on F(''E''). It is not hard to check that this pulled back form is [[equivariant|right-equivariant]] with respect to the natural [[group action|action]] of GL&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') on F(''E'') &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and vanishes on [[vertical bundle|vertical vectors]] (tangent vectors to F(''E'') which lie in the kernel of d''π''). Such vector-valued forms on F(''E'') are important enough to warrant special terminology: they are called ''basic'' or ''tensorial forms'' on F(''E'').

Let ''π'' : ''P'' → ''M'' be a (smooth) [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] and let ''V'' be a fixed vector space together with a [[group representation|representation]] ''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL(''V''). A '''basic''' or '''tensorial form''' on ''P'' of type ρ is a ''V''-valued form ω on ''P'' which is '''equivariant''' and '''horizontal''' in the sense that
#&lt;math&gt;(R_g)^*\omega = \rho(g^{-1})\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; for all ''g'' ∈ ''G'', and
#&lt;math&gt;\omega(v_1, \ldots, v_p) = 0&lt;/math&gt; whenever at least one of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are vertical (i.e., d''π''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0).
Here ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the right action of ''G'' on ''P'' for some ''g'' ∈ ''G''. Note that for 0-forms the second condition is [[vacuously true]].

*Example: If ρ is the [[adjoint representation]] of ''G'' on the Lie algebra, then the connection form ω satisfies the first condition (but not the second). The associated [[curvature form]] Ω satisfies both; hence Ω is a tensorial form of adjoint type. The "difference" of two connection forms is a tensorial form.

Given ''P'' and ''ρ'' as above one can construct the [[associated vector bundle]] ''E'' = ''P'' &amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''V''. Tensorial ''q''-forms on ''P'' are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with ''E''-valued ''q''-forms on ''M''. As in the case of the principal bundle F(''E'') above, given a ''q''-form &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; on ''M'' with values in ''E'', define φ on ''P'' fiberwise by, say at ''u'',
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = u^{-1}\pi^*\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is viewed as a linear isomorphism &lt;math&gt;V \overset{\simeq}\to E_{\pi(u)} = (\pi^*E)_u, v \mapsto [u, v]&lt;/math&gt;. φ is then a tensorial form of type ρ. Conversely, given a tensorial form φ of type ρ, the same formula defines an ''E''-valued form &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; on ''M'' (cf. the [[Chern–Weil homomorphism]].) In particular, there is a natural isomorphism of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(M, E) \simeq \{ f: P \to V | f(ug) = \rho(g)^{-1}f(u) \}, \, \overline{f} \leftrightarrow f&lt;/math&gt;.

*Example: Let ''E'' be the tangent bundle of ''M''. Then identity bundle map id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''E'' →''E'' is an ''E''-valued one form on ''M''. The [[tautological one-form]] is a unique one-form on the frame bundle of ''E'' that corresponds to id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;. Denoted by θ, it is a tensorial form of standard type.&lt;!--Mention this somewhere else: The [[exterior covariant derivative]] of θ, Θ = ''D''θ is called a [[torsion form]].--&gt;

Now, suppose there is a connection on ''P'' so that there is an [[exterior covariant differentiation]] ''D'' on (various) vector-valued forms on ''P''. Through the above correspondence, ''D'' also acts on ''E''-valued forms: define ∇ by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \overline{\phi} = \overline{D \phi}.&lt;/math&gt;
In particular for zero-forms,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: \Gamma(M, E) \to \Gamma(M, T^*M \otimes E)&lt;/math&gt;.
This is exactly the [[covariant derivative]] for the [[connection (vector bundle)|connection on the vector bundle ''E'']].&lt;ref&gt;Proof: &lt;math&gt;D (f\phi) = Df \otimes \phi + f D\phi&lt;/math&gt; for any scalar-valued tensorial zero-form ''f'' and any tensorial zero-form φ of type ρ, and ''Df'' = ''df'' since ''f'' descends to a function on ''M''; cf. this [[Chern–Weil homomorphism#Definition of the homomorphism|Lemma 2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19607">'''Work-family conflict''' occurs when an individual experiences incompatible demands between work and family roles, causing participation in both roles to become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Beutell, N. J. (1985). Sources and conflict between work and family roles. Academy of Management Review, 10(1), 76-88.&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance creates conflict at the [[work-life interface]]. It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict. In certain cases, work-family conflict has been associated with increased [[occupational burnout]], [[job stress]], decreased health, and issues pertaining to [[organizational commitment]] and [[job performance]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amstad, F. T., Meier, L. L., Fasel, U., Elfering, A., &amp; Semmer, N. K. (2011). A meta-analysis of work–family conflict and various outcomes with a special emphasis on cross-domain versus matching-domain relations.

== Foundation ==
Work-family conflict was first studied in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavassani &amp; Movahedi|first=Kayvan Miri &amp; Bahar|date=2014|title=DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORIES AND MEASURES OF WORK-FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS: FROM CONFLICT TO BALANCE|url=http://davidwimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kayvan-miri-lavassani-bahar-movahedi-work-family-life-6-19.pdf|journal=Contemporary Research on Organization Management and Administration|volume=2|pages=2335-7959|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, work and income moved from inside the home (agricultural work) to outside the home (factories).&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Industrialization challenged the current relationship between working and family.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Boundary theory and border theory are the foundations used to study work-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; '''Boundary theory''' divides social life into two interdependent sections, work and family. Individuals have different roles and responsibilities in each section.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Since the sections are interdependent, two roles cannot take place at the same time.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals have to participate in role transformation between expectations of the workplace and expected roles within the family structure.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Border theory''' expands this by considering the influences each section has on the other.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Border theory attempts to pin down ways to manage conflict and achieve balance between conflicting identities.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals may choose to treat these segments separately, moving back and forth between work and family roles (displaying boundary theory) or can decide to integrate the segments with hopes of finding balance.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==Forms of conflict==
Conflict between work and family is [[wikt:bi-directional|bi-directional]]. There is a distinction between what is termed '''work-to-family conflict''' and what is termed '''family-to-work conflict'''.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Work-to-family conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments at work interfere with family life, such as extensive, irregular, or inflexible work hours, work overload and other forms of [[job stress]], interpersonal conflict at work, extensive travel, career transitions, or an unsupportive supervisor or organization.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; For example, an unexpected meeting late in the day may prevent a parent from picking up his or her child from school.

'''Family-to-work conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments in the family interfere with work life, such as the presence of young children, primary responsibility for children, elder care responsibilities, interpersonal conflict within the family unit, or unsupportive family members.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;For example, a parent may need to take time off from work in order to take care of a sick child, or to witness a tournament or performance of a child. Family-to-work conflict is perceived to result in lower work productivity of employees.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Within work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, three subtypes of conflict have been identified: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based. ''Time-based'' conflict entails competing time requirements across work and family roles, ''strain-based'' conflict entails pressures in one role impairing performance in the second role, and ''behavior-based'' conflict entails an incompatibility of behaviors necessary for the two roles. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Powell, G. N. (2006). When work and family are allies: A theory of work-family enrichment. Academy of Management Review, 25, 178–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Although work interface with family (WIF) and family interface with work (FIW) are strongly correlated, more attention has been directed toward WIF. Research, largely attributed to the idea Ariel Russel Hochschild termed the "ideal worker", depicts the inelastic nature of work roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 1997. The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work. New York: Metropolitan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations employers hold of an "ideal worker" already rest on unrealistic assumptions about how the family should operate. Many employers expect that employees with families have someone tending to everything at home, leaving the worker unencumbered. Despite the fact that a majority of families in the U.S are dual earning, the image of the "ideal worker" persists, presenting '''work-family conflict'''.

==Workaholism==
Workaholism correlates with experiences of '''work-to-family conflict''', since one's priority of work may interfere with family commitments.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; In its simplest form, workaholism is said to be a substantial investment in one’s work.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726703056003613|title=Workaholism: It's Definition and Nature|last=Harpaz|first=Itzhak|date=March 2003|website=Sage journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who is said to be involved in the act of workaholism can be labeled as a [[workaholic]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholism is said to be multifaceted and multi-directional.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;The flexibility and satisfaction within one’s job has an impact on an employee’s happiness and satisfaction in the home and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An overabundance of work has been said to take priority over everyone and everything else in the lives of those infatuated with work. Excessive work prevents one from forming and maintaining intimate relationships and close friendships.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholics are known to spend a vast amount of time in work related activities, which then results in the sacrifice of crucial family, social, and recreational activities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Marital problems, trouble with maintaining close relationships, and isolation from friends and family are the common issues related to workaholism and those involved.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In most recent years, employers have become more aware of the strain and stress that work can place on an employee. Companies have since started seeing their employees not only as workers, but also as people with personal and home lives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;Implementation of family-responsive human resource practices and policies that promote work-family balance have become a reality as a way to reduce stress in both environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Implications for organizations ==
With the struggles of work-family conflict, options are necessary to provide a solution for these problems. Loehr and Schwartz compare the extreme demands experienced by an individual in the workplace to that of a professional athlete.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete|title=The Making of a Corporate Athlete|date=2001-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both scenarios energy expenditure (stress) is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without recovery (oscillation) both cannot perform to their greatest ability, eventually leading to [[chronic stress]], burnout, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Persist stress without oscillation and the result will be permanent damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Creating an environment that values oscillation, for instance encouraging 15-minute walk breaks throughout the workday or offering corporate gym memberships, can improve employee cognition, energy, focus, and [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Companies, along with their bottom line and employees, win when mental and physical health are treated as equally important to cognitive capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to gain competitive advantage, organizations are attempting to be portrayed as work-life balance supportive employers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mescher|first=Samula|last2=Benschop|first2=Yvonne|last3=Doorewaard|first3=Hans|title=Representations of work—life balance support|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709349197|journal=Human Relations|volume=63|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1177/0018726709349197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that value employee work-life balance are able to attract and retain satisfied employees, improve worker performance, and boost employee morale and organization identification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Work-family conflict can be diminished by establishing family-friendly policies in the workplace. Some of these policies include maternity, paternity, parental, sick leaves, and health care insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations may provide child care options either as an on-site child care center at the business, references to close child care centers, or supplemented child care incomes for the families placing their children in a child care center.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in technology, individuals who work outside the home and have intense schedules are finding ways to keep in touch with their families when they cannot physically be with them. "Technology has provided a bit of an upper hand, allowing them unprecedented control and creativity in maneuvering the tenuous balance between work and family" (Temple, 2009). Organizations are now able to implement [[telecommuting]] policies which allow employees to work from home&lt;ref&gt;Pitt-Catsouphes, Marcie; Casy, Judi; Shulkin, Sandee; Weber, Julie; Curlew, Mary. (2009). Telework and Telecommuting: Policy Briefing Series. Boston: Sloan Work and Family Research Network. [https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/sites/workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/files/imported/pdfs/policy_makers3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and provide more flexibility and control over their schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, S. B., &amp; Glass, J. L. (1997). The Family Responsive Workplace. Annual Review of Sociology, 289–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of gender==
The role of gender is a large factor in work-family conflict because one's gender may determine their role in the home or work place. Female representation in the workplace is a direct result of power operating covertly through ideological controls.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082"&gt;King, E. (2008). The effect of bias and unrealistic on the advancement of working mothers: Disentangling legitimate concerns from inaccurate stereotypes as predictors of advancement in academe.

A male individual may be unmarried and have no thought as to what "typical" family responsibilities entail because they simply have not had the experience.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/docview/1651315091/fulltextPDF/D0B037A68F9247FBPQ/1?accountid=9435|title=Gender role beliefs and fathers' work family conflict|last1=Hergatt Huffman|first1=Ann|last2=Olson|first2=Kristine|website=ProQuest|publisher=Emerald Publishing|accessdate=25 March 2018|last3=O'Gara Jr.|first3=Thomas|last4=King|first4=Eden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male may be married, but his wife, due to the demands of the husband's position, has remained at home, tending solely to the house and children and experiencing the "typical" family responsibilities. Since the wife is the one who stays home and tends to the children, the husband is more present in the workforce, representing the higher percentage of males at the top of the [[Hierarchy|organization hierarchy]].

The [[motherhood penalty]] is a term sociologists use when arguing that in the workplace working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Deborah|author2=Melissa Binder|author3=Kate Krause|year=2003|title=The Motherhood Wage Penalty Revisited: Experience, Heterogeneity, Work effort and Work-Schedule Flexibility|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=56|pages=273–294|doi=10.2307/3590938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their place of work, women may suffer a per-child wage penalty, leading to a pay gap between mothers and non-mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Not only do working mothers have the burden of balancing work and home life, but they also have to prove they are as dedicated as other employees.&lt;ref name="Paik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=S.|author2=S. Bernard|author3=I. Paik|year=2007|title=Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?|journal=American Journal of Sociology|pages=1297–1338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers tend to suffer less favorable job-site evaluations compared to non-mothers, stating that mothers are much less committed to their jobs, less authoritative, and less dependable than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt; Hence, mothers may experience discrimination is terms of pay, hiring, and day-to-day job experience.&lt;ref name="BudigEngland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budig|first=Michelle|author2=Paula England|year=2001|title=The Wage Penalty for Motherhood|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2657415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way in which companies have shaped the "ideal worker" does not compliment the family lifestyle, nor does it accommodate it.&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;  Long hours and near complete devotion to the profession make it difficult for working mothers to participate in, or get ahead in the workplace while maintaining a home and family .&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;

{{Main|Cutthroat trout}}

The '''yellowfin cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarkii macdonaldi'') is an [[extinct]] [[subspecies]] or variety of the [[cutthroat trout]], a North American freshwater fish.

==Natural history==
At the end of the last ice-age boulders and clay moraine blocked off a tributary of the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River]] in what is now the state of [[Colorado]]. The two [[lake]]s which formed were named the "[[Twin Lakes, Lake County, Colorado|Twin Lakes]]" by the area's settlers. Both lakes held small [[greenback cutthroat trout]] from the early days of the Wild West, but in the mid-1880s reports circulated of much larger trout, up to {{convert|10|lb|kg|0}} in weight, with bright yellow fins.

==Discovery and naming==
In July 1889, Professor [[David Starr Jordan]] and G. R. Fisher visited Twin Lakes and published their discoveries in the 1891 Bulletin of the [[United States Fish Commission]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} They found both the greenback and what they proclaimed to be a new species the "yellowfin cutthroat". In the species description, published in the 1890 edition of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum,&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David Starr and Evermann, Barton Warren. 1889. "Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado". Proceedings of the United States National Museum. Vol. XXI pages 453-454.[https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/13143 Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan and Evermann described the fish as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Color, silvery olive; a broad lemon yellow shade along the sides, lower fins bright golden yellow in life, no red anywhere except the deep red dash on each side of the throat.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The subspecies was scientifically named ''macdonaldi'' after the US Fish Commissioner, [[Marshall McDonald]].

Jordan's specimens were recently re-examined by the fisheries biologist [[Robert J. Behnke]], who commented, "I have no doubt that Jordan was correct; the yellowfin trout and the greenback trout from Twin Lakes were two distinct groups of cutthroat trout".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Extinction==
Until about 1903, greenback and yellowfin cutthroats survived together in Twin Lakes, the populations remaining isolated as both breeders and feeders. The end for the yellowfin cutthroat came soon after the introduction of the [[rainbow trout]] to Twin Lakes. The greenback population interbred with the rainbows, resulting in [[cutbow]]s, but the yellowfin disappeared completely. The yellowfin is now  extinct.
