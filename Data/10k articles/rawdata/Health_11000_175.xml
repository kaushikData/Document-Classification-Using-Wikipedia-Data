'''1000 Hills Community Helpers''' is a [[non-profit organization]] in [[South Africa]] devoted to improving the lives of those affected by [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

The organization was first established in 1989 by Dawn Leppan and Alan Paton, originally as a program to feed those in poverty and suffering from the effects of HIV/AIDS.  After seeing the overwhelming amount of people in need, it was concluded that something more would need to be done, thus founding 1000 Hills Community Helpers.

The Community is located in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], east of the city of [[Pietermaritzburg]] almost to the Indian ocean just north of the coastal city of [[Durban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.kznwib.co.za/Portals/125/docs/Appeal%20for%20assistance%20New%20CCC.pdf|work=1000 Hills Community Helpers|accessdate=8 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151953/http://www.kznwib.co.za/Portals/125/docs/Appeal%20for%20assistance%20New%20CCC.pdf#|archive-date=2012-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of a health and wellness clinic, children's infirmary, feeding scheme, and education and development facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.1000hch.co.za/index.htm|work=1000 Hills Community Helpers|accessdate=8 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107220549/http://www.1000hch.co.za/index.htm#|archive-date=2010-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The clinic is open five days a week, dedicating different days to the elderly, children, open clinic days, and counseling groups for those who need support.

==Founder==
Dawn Leppan was raised by her grandparents who owned a restaurant near the main highway which meandered through the Valley, en route to Durban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Start-Up|url=http://www.kznwib.co.za/Portals/125/docs/Appeal%20for%20assistance%20New%20CCC.pdf|work=1000 Hills Community Helpers|accessdate=8 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151953/http://www.kznwib.co.za/Portals/125/docs/Appeal%20for%20assistance%20New%20CCC.pdf#|archive-date=2012-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She mirrored her grandmother's humanitarianism and founded the 1000 Hills Community Helpers organization.  Leppan has won many awards in recognition for her accomplishments, including the [[Paul Harris Award]].

==Community Clinics==
The clinic at the centre operates with the help of retired and volunteer doctors and paediatricians as well as nursing sisters.  There is a pharmacy run by a retired pharmacist as well as an emergency ward and a 24-hour emergency service run by Dawn.  The aim of the clinic is to improve the lives of babies, children and adults infected and affected by chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, TB, Hepatitis, Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis and Hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1000 Hills Community Helpers|url=http://www.soulofafricacharity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=93|work=Soul of Africa|accessdate=11 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225192014/http://www.soulofafricacharity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=93#|archive-date=2012-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery''' ('''ASCRS'''), a professional society for surgeons specializing in [[eye surgery]], based in [[Fairfax, VA]], was founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About ASCRS |url=http://ascrs.org/about-ascrs/about-ascrs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Associations: National organizations of the U.S. |year=2008 |editor=Swartout, Kristy A. |publisher=Gale (Cengage Learning) |page=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from its sister organization, the [[American Society of Ophthalmic Administrators]] (ASOA), which concerns itself with the business management, including insurance reimbursement and marketing, of ophthalmic practices in the United States. Both associations hold annual meetings or conventions as well as publishing proceedings.

ASCRS publishes a monthly ''Journal of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgery'' (JCRS), as a joint production with the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcrsjournal.org/ Journal of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgery].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Since 1975, the ASCRS annually awards the Binkhorst medal to doctors who have made significant contributions to the science and practice of ophthalmology, which includes a stipend to give the Binkhorst lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|first=Cindy |last=Sebrell |title=2013 recipient of the prestigious ASCRS Binkhorst Medal announced |date=December 2012 |magazine=Eye World |url=https://www.eyeworld.org/article-2013-recipient-of-the-prestigious-ascrs-binkhorst-medal-announced }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Colin |last=Kerr |date=1 April 2017 |title=Boris Malyugin to Deliver Binkhorst Medal Lecture |publisher=''Euro Times'' |url=http://www.eurotimes.org/malyugin-binkhorst-lecture/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ophthalmology Hall of Fame ===
Since 1999, the ASCRS has hosted the [[Ophthalmology Hall of Fame]] to which it periodically elects pioneers of ophthalmology as well as those who have significantly inspired, supported and led the development of ophthalmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ASCRS Ophthalmology Hall of Fame |url=http://ascrs.org/awards/ascrs-ophthalmology-hall-fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goes |first=Frank Joseph |year=2013 |title=The Eye in History |location=New Delhi |publisher=JP Medical Ltd (Jaypee Brothers) |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v0oL8xDJ0VEC&amp;pg=PA8 8] |isbn=978-93-5090-274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Smart from NPG retouched.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|alt=Half length and dark portrait of a serious and slightly plump man wearing a black academic gown with white collar, ruffled cuff, and a large mortarboard.|Christopher Smart]]

The English poet [[Christopher Smart]] (1722‚Äì1771) was confined to [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylums]] from May 1757 until January 1763. Smart was admitted into [[St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics]], [[Upper Moorfields]], London, on 6 May 1757. He was taken there by his father-in-law, [[John Newbery]], although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then. While in St Luke's he wrote ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'' and ''[[A Song to David]]'', the poems considered to be his greatest works. Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was "mad", accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied, and some felt that he had been committed unfairly.

Smart was diagnosed as "incurable" while at St Luke's, and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum, Bethnal Green. All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry. Smart's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as ''Jubilate Agno'' ("Rejoice in the Lamb"). His asylum poetry reveals a desire for "unmediated revelation", and it is possible that the self-evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christianity.

Late 18th-century critics felt that Smart's madness justified them in ignoring his ''A Song to David'', but during the following century [[Robert Browning]] and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of ''Jubilate Agno'' (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.

==Background==
Smart was confined to asylums during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment. During the 18th century, madness was "both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason, and therefore threatening to society and to humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Sweeny 1997 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society.&lt;ref&gt;Keymer 2003 p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[William Battie]]‚Äîwho later treated Smart‚Äîwrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[we] find that Madness is, contrary to the opinion of some unthinking persons, as manageable as many other distempers, which are equally dreadful and obstinate, and yet are not looked upon as incurable, and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned, much less shut up in loathsome prisons as criminals or nuisances to the society.&lt;ref&gt;Battie 1758 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, Battie defined madness as "deluded imagination".&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 209"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was attacked by other physicians, such as [[John Monro (physician)|John Monro]], who worked at [[Bethlem Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 209"/&gt; In his ''Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness'', Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions, but that they lacked the ability to judge properly. Although Monro promoted ideas of reform, his suggested treatment‚Äîbeating patients‚Äîwas as harsh on patients as Battie's preferred option, of completely isolating patients from society.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 209"/&gt;

In 1758, Battie and others argued that those deemed "mad" were abused under the British asylum system, and they pushed for parliamentary action. Battie's ''Treatise on Madness'' emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients. The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the [[Madhouses Act 1774|Act for Regulating Private Madhouses]] (1774), but were too late to help Smart.&lt;ref&gt;Keymer 2003 pp. 184‚Äì185&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics, however, have a more cynical view of the 18th-century use of the term "madness" when diagnosing patients; psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Szasz 1972 pp. xv‚Äìxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1989 pp. 38‚Äì64&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of "great confinement".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1989 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, "the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms."&lt;ref name="Keymer p. 183"&gt;Keymer 2003 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

18th century treatment of inpatients was simple: they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread, oatmeal, some meat or cheese, and a little amount of beer, which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs;&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; they were denied contact with outsiders, including family members;&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 209"/&gt; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness (these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside).&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 204"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; If their actions appeared "afresh and without assignable cause", then their condition would be labelled as "original" madness and deemed incurable.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 204"/&gt;  An institution like St Luke's, run by Battie, held both "curable" and "incurable" patients.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 206"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment, and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 207"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asylum==
During the 1740s, Smart published many poems while a student at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]]. He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, Smart started to familiarise himself with [[Grub Street]], London's writing district, and met [[John Newbery]], a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including ''Poems on Several Occasions'' (1752). Of these works, Smart was known for his [[Seatonian Prize]]-winning poems, his [[Pastoral#Pastoral poetry|pastoral poem]] ''[[The Hop-Garden]]'', and his mock epic ''[[The Hilliad]]''. In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo pp. 22‚Äì100&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of [[Horace]], but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year-long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled ''The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist'', and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo pp. 102‚Äì104&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1756, Smart's father-in-law Newbery published, without permission, Smart's ''Hymn to the Supreme Being'', a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a "disturbed mental state".&lt;ref&gt;Curry 2005 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the illness, Smart was possibly confined to Newbery's home and unable to write or be socially active. Out of sympathy for Smart, many of his friends, including writer and critic [[Samuel Johnson]], began to write in the ''Universal Visiter'' to fulfill Smart's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1974 pp. 36‚Äì37&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Hymn to the Supreme Being'' marked the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying "without ceasing".&lt;ref&gt;Curry 2005 pp. 6‚Äì7&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's behaviour was probably influenced by [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St Paul]]'s command in the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]] to "Pray without ceasing" and [[William Law]]'s ''The Spirit of Prayer'', which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God.&lt;ref name="Anderson p. 37"&gt;Anderson 1974 p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him.&lt;ref name="Piozzi 1849 p. 24"&gt;Piozzi 1849 p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in ''Jubilate Agno'': "For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff" (''Jubilate Agno'' B 90‚Äì91).&lt;ref&gt;Smart 1980 p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Hunter, Smart's biographer and nephew, described the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the fortune as well as the constitution of Mr. Smart required the utmost care, he was equally negligent in the management of both, and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alienations of mind; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter 1791 pp. xx‚Äìxxi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, and it was Johnson that, "on the first approaches of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter 1791 p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; However, at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the ''Universal Visiter''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth and Noyes 1943 p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In joking about writing for the ''Universal Visiter'', Johnson claimed: "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write&amp;nbsp;... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer."&lt;ref&gt;Keymer 1999 p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"/&gt; [[Hester Thrale]] reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's "religious fervor" tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"/&gt; Smart's own testimony that he "blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company" (''Jubilate Agno'' B 90‚Äì91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the [[Board of Green Cloth]], the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 201"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for "frenzy" at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 201"/&gt;

The specific events of Smart's confinement are unknown. He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being "curable" to "incurable", and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons.&lt;ref name="Mounsey pp. 202-204"&gt;Mounsey 2001 pp. 202‚Äì204&lt;/ref&gt; During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record that he ever saw her again.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 239"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote ''Jubilate Agno''.&lt;ref&gt;Guest 1989 p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in asylum, Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry; these lyric fragments eventually formed his ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'' and ''[[A Song to David]]''. Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self-therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Sweeny 1997 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Although 20th-century critics debate whether his new poetic self-examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for "unmediated revelation" from God.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes 1996 p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; There is an "inner light" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes 1996 p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics===
[[Image:Jubilate Agno let.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Handwritten manuscript of a page with about a hundred lines, each a sentence beginning with the word "Let"|A page from ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'' written while in asylum]]

Few details are known about Smart's time at [[St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics]]. He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a "Curable Patient".&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in ''A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.''&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"/&gt; To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 206"/&gt;

There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 209"/&gt; One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in ''St Luke's Minute Book'', which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;12 May 1758&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart (who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not Suffit. reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined. Ordered. That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 207"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 210"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie. Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 207"/&gt; Eventually, Smart was deemed "incurable" and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.&lt;ref name="Mounsey pp. 202-204"/&gt;

After being released from St Luke's, Smart was taken to a private madhouse.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 208"&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a ''Mr Potter'' who kept a private house at Bethnal Green".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 122"&gt;Sherbo qtd. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; She described her experience as being held in a "small neat parlour".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 122"/&gt; However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes:&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 208"/&gt; "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others" (''Jubilate Agno'' B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Piozzi described Smart's general situation: "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS."&lt;ref name="Keymer p. 183"/&gt; It is very possible that he felt "homeless" during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a "limbo... between public and private space" from being watched by outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes 1996 p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, only a few of his works were still being published, but the proceeds were taken by Newbery.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 239"/&gt; However, Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym "Mrs Midnight" titled ''Mrs. Midnight's Orations; and other Select Pieces: as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay-Market, London''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 167"&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Smart did not profit from the work, but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 167"/&gt; Smart, according to his 20th-century biographer Arthur Sherbo, had only "his God and his poetry".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 164"&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter's.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 164"/&gt;

===Release===
There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: "He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary &amp; salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more."&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 239"/&gt;  What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release. In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums. In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations. A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart. To those around him, Smart appeared perfectly sane, and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care. Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 pp. 239‚Äì246&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving asylum, Smart took the manuscripts of ''A Song to David'', many translations of Psalms, and ''Jubilate Agno''. ''A Song to David'' was published on 6 April 1763. Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 pp. 239, 247‚Äì256&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jubilate Agno'' stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of [[William Cowper]], a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of "madness". The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1974 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title ''Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes 1996 p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

Samuel Johnson's biographer [[James Boswell]] described a moment when [[Charles Burney]] inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart's state. Johnson used the term "madness" to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, or in any other unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [Charles] Burney:&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was ''carried'' back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit &lt;nowiki&gt;[=Christopher]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.'&lt;ref&gt;Boswell 1986 pp. 97‚Äì98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article printed in the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', [[Hester Thrale|Hester Piozzi]], Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In every ''other'' transaction of life no man's wits could be more regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of ''distraction'' than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.&lt;ref name="Piozzi 1849 p. 24"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his ''A Song to David'', called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still "mad". The view was widely held, and the poet [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]] wrote to [[Thomas Gray]], "I have seen his Song to David &amp; from thence conclude him as mad as ever."&lt;ref&gt;Toynebee and Whibley 1935 p. 802&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet [[Robert Browning]] argued that ''A Song to David'' was great because Smart was mad at the time.&lt;ref name="Jacobs p. 193"&gt;Jacobs 1998 p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem ''Parleyings'' (1887), Browning claimed:
:Armed with this instance, have I diagnosed
:Your case, my Christopher? The man was sound
:And sane at starting: all at once the ground
:Gave way beneath his step
:&lt;nowiki&gt;* * * * *&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Then‚Äîas heaven were loth
:To linger;‚Äîlet earth understand too well
:How heaven at need can operate‚Äîoff fell
:The flame-robe, and the untransfigured man
:Resumed sobriety,‚Äîas he began,
:So did he end nor alter pace, not he!&lt;ref&gt;Browning 1887 p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
To Browning, Smart's temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in ''A Song to David'' poetry similar to that of [[John Milton]] and [[John Keats]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs p. 193"/&gt; Christopher Smart, as Browning's poem continued,
:pierced the screen
:'Twixt thing and word, lit language straight from soul,‚Äî
:Left no fine film-flake on the naked coal
:Live from the censer&lt;ref&gt;Browning 1887, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
Browning's remarks brought about a later appreciation of ''A Song to David'' and Smart's madness.&lt;ref&gt;Smart 1983 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; A review of Browning's ''Parleying'' claimed that Christopher Smart was "possessed by his subject... and where there is true possession&amp;nbsp;‚Äì where the fires of the poet's imagination are not choked by self-consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect&amp;nbsp;‚Äì idiosyncrasy, mannerism, and even conventional formulae are for the time 'burnt and purged away'."&lt;ref&gt;''Athenaeum'' 19 February 1887 p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] emphasised the benefits of Smart's madness and claimed that ''A Song to David'' was "the only great ''accomplished'' poem of the last century."&lt;ref&gt;Smart 1983 p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, [[Francis Palgrave]] continued the theme when he wrote that the ''Song'' exhibited "noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to Heaven" and that it was "unique in our Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave, Francis T. ''Treasury of Sacred Song'' London, 1889. p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after Palgrave, critic [[John Churton Collins]] agreed with Rossetti and Palgrave, but to a lesser extent, when he wrote, "This poem stands alone, the most extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps, in our literature, the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century, the work of a poet who, though he produced much, has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, John Churton. ''Treasury of Minor British Poetry''. London, 1896. p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century and contemporary===
Twentieth-century critics favoured the view that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Sweeny 1997 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; A review by "Mathews" titled "Thin Partitions", in 30 March 1901 ''The Academy'', claimed that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Christopher Smart was a very beggarly poet of the eighteenth century [...] but had not the smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry‚Äînor anything else [...] Legally mad, that is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad‚Äîlegally and medically‚Äîonce, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was not mad enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century‚Äîperhaps ''the'' finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he never did anything after.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews 1974 p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1933, [[A. E. Housman]] sided with Browning's and Mathew's interpretation and connected Smart's madness with poetic genius in his lecture ''The Name and Nature of Poetry'': "As matters actually stand, who are the English poets of that age in whom pre-eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect? These four: Collins, Christopher Smart, Cowper, and Blake. And what other characteristic had these four in common? They were mad."&lt;ref&gt;Youngquist 1989 qtd. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Branimir Rieger differed from Housman's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that "Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals, guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine. Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality, but at a cost of all human relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Rieger 1994 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes, when discussing Smart's ''Hymn to the Supreme Being'', said, "The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged. Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which, in disorder, was to produce the ''Jubilate Agno'', and, with order restored, the ''Song to David''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth and Noyes 1943 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they claimed that Smart's
&lt;blockquote&gt;preternatural excitement to prayer seems to have been poor Smart's only real mental aberration, unless his drunkenness be considered pathological. When his mind was removed entirely from the field of prayer, he was but little changed from his sane state. His powers of reason, though thus warped, were not taken from him, and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth p. 88"&gt;Ainsworth p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely sceptical about Smart's diagnosis when they continued: "But when the desire to pray struck him, Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality."&lt;ref name="Ainsworth p. 88"/&gt;

In 1960, neurologist [[Russell Brain, 1st Baron Brain|Russell Brain]] diagnosed Smart as suffering from [[cyclothymia]] or [[bipolar disorder|manic depression]].&lt;ref name="Brain"&gt;Brain 1960 pp. 113‚Äì122&lt;/ref&gt; Brain based his diagnosis on Smart's own claims about how he felt, and he concluded that "in Smart's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness, but he drank because he was mentally unstable."&lt;ref name="Brain"/&gt; Arthur Sherbo, in 1967, argued that "The nature of Smart's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time" and then argued that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;since Battie himself pronounced him uncured, he must have been subject to hallucinations. Strong drink, taken often enough and in sufficient quantity, will have that effect, of course, but Battie, distinguishing between 'original' and 'consequential' madness [...] would allow only that excessive drinking could 'become a very common, tho' remoter cause of Madness.' Others differed: John Ball in his ''Modern Practice of Physic'', 1760, lists 'anxiety of mind' and too much 'strong vinous or spirituous liquors' as 'antecedent causes' of madness. Smart's mania, however it manifested itself, and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer, did not stem from drunkenness; it was aggravated, however, by frequent recourse to the bottle. Ironically enough, as Mrs. Piozzi recognised, if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home, all might have been well for him.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo 1967 p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The possible religious component of Smart's condition was taken up by 20th-century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 210"/&gt; Laurence Binyon, in 1934, believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart: "Smart's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction ''Pray without ceasing''. He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications [...] Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity. But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment; whereas the ''Song'' is unmistakably the expression of a great release."&lt;ref&gt;Binyon 1934 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Binyon's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes, in 1966, who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced [[enthusiasm]], a strong spiritual connection to God. It was against religious prejudice that she argued,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cause of Smart's eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work‚Äîhe had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.&lt;ref&gt;Blaydes p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired. The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order.&lt;ref&gt;Blaydes pp. 51‚Äì53&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "Smart, the hack-writer, would not have been greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately. The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation."&lt;ref&gt;Blaydes p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, "in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [...] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us. Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age."&lt;ref&gt;Blaydes p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterised Smart's "illness" as insanity and obsession, but believed that "Smart's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: 'Pray without ceasing.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Anderson p. 37"/&gt; During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart "probably suffered some periods of delirium" but also "appeared to know what he was doing".&lt;ref name="Anderson p. 38"&gt;Anderson 1974 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were "addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam".&lt;ref name="Anderson p. 38"/&gt; Later, in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that "The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed" and "it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and H√∂lderlin."&lt;ref&gt;Rosen 1998 p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, following Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an {{"'}}animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the "medical stigmatization" he felt at the hands of his fellow man.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes 1996 p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible."&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 208"/&gt; Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that ''Jubilate Agno'' was "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing."&lt;ref&gt;Ingram 1998 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annabelle Natalie''' "'''Belle'''" '''Gibson''' (born October 8, 1991)&lt;ref name="The Australian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;T"/&gt; is a [[scammer]], blogger, [[alternative medicine|alternative health]] advocate, and [[Quackery|quack]] from [[Australia]], who fraudulently claimed to have donated significant income to charities, and of having forgone conventional cancer treatments to effectively self-manage multiple cancers through diet and alternative therapies.

Gibson is the author of ''The Whole Pantry'' smartphone application and its later companion cookbook, both of which were subsequently withdrawn from sale from the Apple Store. The Whole Pantry application was featured in promotional material for the as-then unreleased [[Apple Watch]], but was removed from Apple advertising after the controversy broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation starts into creator of Apple Watch default app The Whole Pantry for fraud, fake cancer story|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/03/11/belle-gibson-scam/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theage-applewatch"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/expertise/australian-app-creators-triumph-with-apple-watch-20140913-10g0mp.html | title=Australian app creator's triumph with Apple Watch | work=The Age | date=13 September 2014 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh-healingbelle"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/friends-and-doctors-raise-doubts-over-healing-belle-cancer-claims-20150310-1401rr.html | title=Friends and doctors raise doubts over 'Healing Belle' cancer claims | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2015, after media reporting identified Gibson's fraudulent claims of charity fundraising and donation-making, further media investigation soon revealed that Gibson had also fabricated her stories of cancer, and lied about her age as well as other details of her personal life and history. Concerns were expressed that Gibson had led a profligate lifestyle, renting an upmarket town house, leasing a luxury car and office space, undergoing cosmetic dental procedures, purchasing designer clothes and holidaying internationally, on money claimed to have been raised or destined for charity.&lt;ref&gt;Donelly, Beau, and Nick Toscano, "[http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/supporters-turn-on-belle-gibson-as-cancer-claims-unravel-20150314-1439ny.html Supporters turn on Belle Gibson as cancer claims unravel]", ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 14 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The media were increasingly reporting specified fraudulent claims by Gibson and The Whole Pantry regarding charity fundraising and donation-making, and detailed the many inconsistencies in Gibson's claimed medical history. With a collapsing social media support base, in an April 2015 interview Gibson admitted that her claims of cancers had been fabricated, stating that "none of it's true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|author2=Toscano, Nick|title=The Whole Pantry author Belle Gibson admits she lied about having terminal cancer|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/the-whole-pantry-author-belle-gibson-admits-she-lied-about-having-terminal-cancer-20150422-1mqt8a.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=smh.com.au|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson's actions have been described as "particularly predatory",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montague|first1=Jules|title=M√ºnchausen by internet: the sickness bloggers who fake it online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/29/jules-gibson-munchausen-by-internet-sickness-bloggers-fake-it-whole-pantry|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Ltd|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "deceit on a grand scale, for personal profit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tuohy|first1=Wendy|title=Belle Gibson: a story of deceit, betrayal of trust on a grand scale|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/belle-gibson-a-story-of-deceit-betrayal-of-trust-on-a-grand-scale/story-fni0fhk1-1227315495119|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Herald Sun|publisher=NewsCorp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2016, [[Consumer Affairs Victoria]] announced legal action against Gibson and Inkerman Road Nominees Pty Ltd (originally known as Belle Gibson Pty Ltd) for "false claims by Ms Gibson and her company concerning her diagnosis with terminal brain cancer, her rejection of conventional cancer treatments in favour of natural remedies, and the donation of proceeds to various charities."&lt;ref name="ConsumerAffairs2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belle Gibson to face legal action over claims, Penguin agrees to enforceable undertaking - Media release|url=https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/belle-gibson-to-face-legal-action-penguin-agrees-to-enforceable-undertaking--media-release|publisher=Consumer Affairs Victoria|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin Australia Pty Ltd, publishers of ''The Whole Pantry'' book, had cooperated with the investigation and agreed to make a $30,000 donation to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund, acknowledging that it had not taken adequate steps to verify Gibson's claims prior to publishing the book.&lt;ref name="ConsumerAffairs2016"/&gt;  On 15 March 2017, the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] supported most of those claims, concluding that ‚ÄúMs Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==
According to interviews she has given, Gibson left her Brisbane family home at age 12 to live with a classmate, and later she lived with a family friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Whole Pantry founder inspires in the face of terminal cancer|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/the-whole-pantry-founder-inspires-in-the-face-of-terminal-cancer/story-fniym874-1227133426731|website=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson attended [[Wynnum State High School]] in [[Manly, Queensland|Manly]], [[Brisbane]], before, at around the age of 16, dropping out of school in Year 10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/wellness-guru-belle-gibson-opposed-vaccination-backed-medical-cannabis/story-fnihsrf2-1227260568033 | title=Wellness guru Belle Gibson 'opposed vaccination, backed medical cannabis' | work=The Courier Mail | date=13 March 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she also later claimed to have been home schooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/cancer-survivor-belle-gibson-retains-lawyer-20150312-142ed2.html|title='Cancer survivor' Belle Gibson retains lawyer|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson worked for some time as a trainee for catering supply company PFD Food Services in [[Lytton, Queensland]],&lt;ref name = "Psychopath"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mega-blogger-belle-gibson-described-herself-as-a-distinguished-psychopath/story-fni0fiyv-1227259174931 | title=Mega blogger Belle Gibson described herself as a 'distinguished psychopath' | work=The Courier Mail | date=12 March 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but social media reflected that by late 2008, at either 16 or 17 years of age (given an October 1991 birth date), she had relocated to [[Perth]], where she was involved in the skateboarding culture and actively participating in its online community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skateboard.com.au/bandits/read.cfm?forum=15&amp;thread=60945&amp;p=2&amp;archive=1|title=santa clause  Page 2|work=skateboard.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back In Hospital - Round Three|url=http://www.skateboard.com.au/bandits/read.cfm?forum=15&amp;thread=65113&amp;archive=0&amp;blog=0&amp;p=1|website=skateboard.com.au|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson subsequently moved from Perth to [[Melbourne]] in July 2009 at age 17, and became a mother in July 2010, at age 18. Gibson launched The Whole Pantry application in August 2013, at age 21.

Gibson reportedly told a prospective business partner in 2014 that she had "several names" that she went under,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|last2=Toscano|first2=Nick|title=Friends and doctors raise doubts over 'Healing Belle' cancer claims|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/friends-and-doctors-raise-doubts-over-healing-belle-cancer-claims-20150310-1401rr.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her most recent interview with ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]'' claimed "her mother changed her name five times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weaver|first1=Clair|title=What it's really like to interview Belle Gibson|url=http://www.aww.com.au/latest-news/in-the-mag/what-its-like-to-interview-belle-gibson-20282|accessdate=22 April 2015|newspaper=The Australian Women's Weekly|publisher=Baeur Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson's corporate filings indicate that she is three years younger than she publicly claims to be.&lt;ref name="The Australian"/&gt;

In interviews, Gibson stated that since 2009 she had self-treated her then claimed malignant brain and various other cancers (blood, spleen, uterus, liver, kidney and neurological) through diet, exercise, the "power of fruits, vegetables",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollynoble.com/2013/08/friday-foodie-belle-gibson-chocolate-nut-butter-cups/|title=Friday Foodie: Chocolate Nut Butter Cups|work=pollynoble.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] practices, [[craniosacral therapy]], colonic irrigations and (controversial) Gerson treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/the-whole-pantry-withdrawn-holistic-recipe-book-taken-off-shelves-as-authors-cancer-claims-are-disputed-10114642.html|title=The Whole Pantry withdrawn: Holistic recipe book taken off shelves as Belle Gibson's cancer claims are disputed|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson attributed the onset of her claimed cancers to a reaction to cervical cancer vaccine [[Gardasil]].&lt;ref name = "Psychopath"/&gt;

===The Whole Pantry===
Gibson launched The Whole Pantry application in August 2013, and there were reportedly 200,000 downloads within the first month. Gibson soon after signed a book deal with Lantern Books for an accompanying table top cookbook (published in October 2014), and was working with Apple in September 2014, to transition the application as a privileged preinstalled default Third Party inclusion in the [[Apple Watch]] launch, which was scheduled for April 2015.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Apple took steps to promote Gibson internationally after it saw The Whole Pantry app.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toscano|first1=Nick|last2=Donelly|first2=Beau|title=Apple exposed over Belle Gibson affair|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/apple-exposed-over-belle-gibson-affair-20171119-gzoasp.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|work=The Age|date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2015, it was estimated that in excess of $1 million had been made in sales of The Whole Pantry application and book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com.au/news/zeitgeist/2015/3/what-we-know-about-belle-gibson/|title=Belle Gibson - The Whole Pantry|work=Elle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson chronicled her battle with cancer on a blog, by the same name The Whole Pantry, but "doubts about her claims surfaced after she failed to deliver a promised $300,000 donation to a charity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendham|first1=Tim|title=Not Healthy|journal=The Skeptic|volume=35|issue=2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before doubts were raised about her health and charitable donation claims, Gibson had intended to expand the brand beyond the health, lifestyle and 'wellbeing' reflected in the Whole Pantry application and book, having earlier registered the domain The Whole Life, and advertised in December 2014 to recruit an IT specialist to expand the application and brand portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wfh.io/jobs/952-ui-ux-designer-the-whole-pantry?hc_location=ufi|title=Remote Design Job - UI / UX Designer @ The Whole Pantry - WFH.io|work=wfh.io}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both The Whole Pantry App and The Whole Life were registered by her partner, Clive Rothwell, in Gibson's corporate name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://who.is/whois/thewholelife|title=Thewholelife.com Whois Lookup - Who.is - Who.is|work=who.is}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Whole Pantry registrar was amended in March 2015 after the controversy broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheWholePantryApp.Com|url=https://who.is/whois/thewholepantryapp|website=Who.Is|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While The Whole Pantry has unequivocally denied that Gibson ever helped anyone to reject conventional cancer treatment, Gibson has been quoted from her social media posts as claiming that she had "countless times helped others" to forgo conventional medical treatment for cancers and to treat themselves 'naturally', as well as "leading them down natural therapy for everything from fertility, depression, bone damage and other types of cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|last2=Toscano|first2=Nick|title=Backlash over app developer Belle Gibson's missing charity money|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/backlash-over-app-developer-belle-gibsons-missing-charity-money-20150309-13yzd4.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health claims===
When the book was launched in November 2014, Gibson claimed in its preface that she had been "stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer",&lt;ref name="smh-healingbelle"/&gt; but her story soon emerged as inconsistent: she also told media outlets that the cancer had reached her liver and kidneys, and three months earlier had posted on The Whole Pantry's Facebook page that her cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, brain and uterus. She previously claimed that she had undergone heart surgery operations several times and to have momentarily died on the operating table. However, there were no scars as a result of heart surgery. She also claimed to have suffered a stroke. Gibson was unable to substantiate her medical claims nor name the doctors who diagnosed her condition and treated her.&lt;ref name = "Surgeries"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guilliatt|first1=Richard|title=Mega-blogger Belle Gibson casts doubt on her own cancer claims|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mega-blogger-belle-gibson-casts-doubt-on-her-own-cancer-claims/story-e6frg8zx-1227255933051|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=[[The Australian]] Business Review|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following adverse media coverage, there was considerable scrutiny of her story leading to doubts being cast on her cancer diagnosis, and on previous claims around her health issues, including having cancer&lt;ref name="abc-misdiagnosis"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-10/cancer-survivor-author-belle-gibson-misdiagnosis-whole-pantry/6295426 | title=Belle Gibson: Cancer survivor, The Whole Pantry author, app developer claims 'misdiagnosis' | work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=9 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldsun-dsehc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health/questions-over-blogger-belle-gibsons-cancer-diagnosis/story-fniylyd2-1227256473119 | title=Questions over blogger Belle Gibson's cancer diagnosis (originally: Belle Gibson, does she even have cancer?) | work=Herald Sun | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the multiple heart surgeries.&lt;ref name = "Surgeries"/&gt;  Gibson's story was reported to be "being erased from the internet".&lt;ref name="heraldsun-erased"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/whole-pantry-founder-belle-gibsons-stories-of-beating-terminal-cancer-erased-from-internet/story-fni0fit3-1227257742137 | title=Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson's stories of beating terminal cancer erased from internet | work=Herald Sun | date=11 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement Apple had initially indicated that it intended to retain the app on the Apple Watch, stating that their interest related as to only whether the app performs as it is supposed to. However the app was subsequently withdrawn from the Apple Watch, after first being removed from the Australian and US App Stores.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Charitable claims===
At the same time, claims also emerged that charity funds raised in 2013 and 2014 had not been donated to the claimed causes,&lt;ref name="theage-backlash"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/backlash-over-app-developer-belle-gibsons-missing-charity-money-20150309-13yzd4.html | title=Backlash over app developer Belle Gibson's missing charity money | work=The Age | date=9 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essentialbaby"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/current-affairs/belle-gibson-the-missing-charity-money-and-the-confounding-cancer-claims-20150310-13zsel.html | title=Belle Gibson, the missing charity money and the confounding cancer claims | work=Essential Baby | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Gibson rejects,&lt;ref name="newscomau-refutes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/belle-gibsons-the-whole-pantry-refutes-claims-about-charity-donations/story-fniym3t1-1227255183760 | title=Belle Gibson's The Whole Pantry refutes claims about charity donations | work=news.com.au | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Fairfax Media]] revealed that The Whole Pantry founder "failed to hand over proceeds solicited in the name of five charities" and had "grossly overstated the company's total donations to different causes".&lt;ref name="smh-healingbelle" /&gt;  Two charities confirmed to ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper that her company had used their names in fundraising drives but had either failed to deliver the donations or had inadequately accounted for the funds.&lt;ref name="heraldsun-erased" /&gt;

Gibson had claimed on a number of occasions in 2014 that The Whole Pantry had donated approximately $300,000 to charities involved in (among other things) maternal healthcare in developing nations, medical support for children with cancer, and funding schools in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/macman/pop-into-the-pantry-app-for-a-healthier-lifestyle-20140723-ztvos.html|title=Pop into The Pantry app for a healthier lifestyle|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, when The Whole Pantry application was pre-installed on the Apple [[iPad]], Gibson claimed through her [[Instagram]] account to be working with 20 different charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belle Gibson // thewholepantry@healing_belle|url=https://populagram.appspot.com/user/healing_belle|website=Populagram|publisher=Populgram, Instagram|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson has long claimed in her [[LinkedIn]] professional networking profile, established in February 2013, to be a philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belle Gibson, The Whole Pantry|url=https://au.linkedin.com/pub/belle-gibson/85/a97/686|website=LinkedIn|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When confronted by investigative journalists about the doubtfulness of these and other claims in early 2015, Gibson admitted that she had seriously overstated the level of charitable donations that had been made.   Subsequent media reporting in March 2015 revealed that it could only be ascertained that an estimated $7,000 of the previously claimed $300,000 had been donated to a total of three charities, with at least $1,000 of the $7,000 reportedly having been donated only after Gibson became aware of the [[Fairfax Media]] investigation into her earlier claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|last2=Toscano|first2=NIck|title=Charity money promised by 'inspirational' health app developer Belle Gibson not handed over|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/charity-money-promised-by-inspirational-health-app-developer-belle-gibson-not-handed-over-20150308-13xgqk.html|website=www.smh.com.au|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another $1,000 of the $7,000 had been donated to a charitable cause under her spouse Clive Rothwell's name, rather than Gibson's or the company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startsomegood.com/Venture/the_asrc_food_justice_truck/Supporters|title=Supporters - The ASRC Food Justice Truck - StartSomeGood: Igniting Ideas, Investment &amp; Impact.|work=StartSomeGood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2015, the parents of a young child suffering from brain cancer, whom Gibson had befriended, came forward to report that they had been unaware that Gibson had earlier been claiming to be fundraising for their child's treatment on their behalf. The family stated they had not known about Gibson's claim to be charity fundraising on behalf of the child, and the family had never received any funds from her or The Whole Pantry. The family suspected Gibson had been using information gleaned from the family's experiences to underpin her own claims to having brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavanagh|first1=Rebekah|title=Family of desperately ill boy fear health guru Belle Gibson used their son to bolster her cancer claims|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/family-of-desperately-ill-boy-fear-health-guru-belle-gibson-used-their-son-to-bolster-her-cancer-claims/story-fni0fit3-1227273020233|website=www.heraldsun.com.au|publisher=''[[Herald Sun]]'', [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer Affairs Victoria has initiated an investigation.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/health-app-founder-and-alternative-cancer-treatment-advocate-investigated-over-charity-donations | title=Health app founder and alternative cancer treatment advocate investigated over charity donations | work=The Guardian | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support of controversial medical practices===
Gibson's and The Whole Pantry's statements regarding the benefits of exercise, healthy eating and a positive mindset were uncontroversial, being widely acknowledged as conducive to holistic well being. However, on her now deleted 'OnlyBelle'  [[Instagram]] account and in other social media, Gibson also promoted more controversial or potentially dangerous alternative medical practices, including: [[Gerson therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Debelle|first1=Penelope|last2=Hadfield|first2=Shelley|title=Belle Gibson and The Whole Pantry: Is her story fact or fiction?|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/health/belle-gibson-and-the-whole-pantry-is-her-story-fact-or-fiction/story-fni0dguy-1227265261138|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=The Advertiser|publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-vaccination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Daniel|last2=Noble|first2=Freya|title='She pushed me not to vaccinate my kids'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2990598/She-tried-convince-not-vaccinate-kids-Belle-Gibson-s-betrayed-former-friend-says-Pantry-founder-come-clean-truth-cancer-survival-story.html|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=Daily Mail Australia|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the consumption of non-pasteurised [[raw milk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jefferson|first1=Andrew|last2=Cavanagh|first2=Rebekah|title=Lifestyle blogger Belle Gibson slips up on booze, milk|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/lifestyle-blogger-belle-gibson-slips-up-on-booze-milk/|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=Herald Sun|publisher=NewsCorp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly controversial [[Gerson]] treatment had been similarly promoted by another Australian 'wellness' blogger, [[Jessica Ainscough]], whose funeral Gibson attended when Ainscough succumbed to her cancer at age 29 in late February 2015. With approximately 97% of the population under seven years of age immunised, Australian Government [[vaccination policy]] heavily penalises parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, by denying access to significant welfare and other benefits, worth approximately $11,700 per annum. The sale of [[raw milk]] for human consumption is illegal in Australia and, in 2014 in Gibson's state of Victoria, one three-year-old died and another four children under the age of five became seriously ill after consuming non-pasteurised [[raw milk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Victoria launches crackdown on sale of 'raw' unpasteurised milk|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/28/victoria-launches-crackdown-on-sale-of-raw-unpasteurised-milk|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concern over publisher culpability===
As the controversy grew, questions began to be raised about Apple, Penguin and the Australian media's lack of due diligence in [[prima facie]] accepting Gibson's claims to suffering multiple cancers, an issue taken up by Australia's ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Paul|title=How the media fell for Belle|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4198886.htm|website=ABC.NET.AU|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in response to media enquiry in mid March 2015, declined to remove The Whole Pantry application from sale, stating that it was only concerned about the functionality of an application. However, The Whole Pantry was soon thereafter removed from inclusion in the Apple Watch launch.  Apple subsequently deleted the application from the [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]], and soon thereafter also removed it from all [[Apple Watch]] promotional material. Apple has not provided any public comment regarding the reasons behind the removal of The Whole Pantry application from the Apple Store and Apple Watch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Duncan|title=Fake cancer survivor Belle Gibson's app pulled from App Store, still linked to Apple Watch though|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/03/17/fake-cancer-survivor-belle-gibsons-app-pulled-from-app-store-still-linked-to-apple-watch-though/|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=Siliconangle.com|publisher=SiliconANGLE Media|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an internal email from an Australian executive to the US team acknowledged that the removal would be subject to comment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Lantern Books (Penguin), when initially approached by investigative journalists, claimed it had not confirmed the validity of Gibson's cancer claims as it was not required to as the book was "a collection of recipes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hallbaeck|first1=Jan|title=The 'hole' in the pantry story: should Penguin have validated Belle Gibson's cancer claims?|url=https://theconversation.com/the-hole-in-the-pantry-story-should-penguin-have-validated-belle-gibsons-cancer-claims-38843|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Trust|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in mid March 2015 and as the controversy grew, Penguin withdrew the book from sale, citing a lack of response from Gibson to its queries relating to the media accusations. [[Fairfax Media]], however, reported that Penguin had, prior to publication of the book, already quizzed (and videotaped) Gibson on her cancer story as recounted in the preface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|last2=Toscano|first2=Nick|title=Publisher Penguin pulls Belle Gibson cook book The Whole Pantry|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/publisher-penguin-pulls-belle-gibson-cook-book-the-whole-pantry-20150316-1m0dsc.html|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Penguin Australia agreed to pay AU30,000 to the [[Consumer Affairs Victoria|Victorian Consumer Law Fund]] as a penalty for failing to validate the factual content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36195825|title=Cancer-faking blogger faces legal action|date=2016-05-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] segment aired, the ''Elle Australia'' magazine admitted that following its laudatory story on Gibson, "The Most Inspiring Woman You've Met This Year", which was published in December 2014, Elle Australia had received anonymous but specific claims that Gibson was fabricating her story, but ultimately dismissed the email as "lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawrence|first1=Vanessa|title=What we know about Belle Gibson|url=http://www.elle.com.au/news/zeitgeist/2015/3/what-we-know-about-belle-gibson/|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Elle Australia|publisher=Elle Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second [[Bauer Media Group]] magazine, ''Cosmopolitan'', which had awarded Gibson its 2014 'Fun, Fearless Female' social media award, later revealed that it too had received an email, but had dismissed out of hand the email's accusations that Gibson was fabricating her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sams|first1=Lauren|title=An honest account of our experience with Belle Gibson|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com.au/health-lifestyle/lifestyle/2015/3/an-honest-account-of-our-experience-with-belle-gibson/|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=Cosmopolitan|publisher=Bauer Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on 24 April 2015, after Gibson had admitted to having faked her cancers, in defending the magazine's decision not to strip Gibson of its 2014 social media award, Cosmopolitan's editor stated that Gibson had been "reader nominated and reader voted", the award being "a competition where readers are nominating people that they're inspired by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Annette|title=Cosmo defend failure to research Belle cancer claims and says she can keep Fun Fearless Female award|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/cosmo-defend-failure-to-research-belle-cancer-claims-and-says-she-can-keep-fun-fearless-female-award/story-fni0cvc9-1227318967969|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=NewsCorp|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cosmopolitan's Associate Editor had a month earlier, on 17 March 2015, stated in the magazine's "honest account" of the its dealings with Gibson that "I put forward the nomination myself", indicating that Cosmopolitan magazine, rather than the public, had been instrumental in promoting Gibson's award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sams|first1=Lauren|title=An honest account of our experience with Belle Gibson|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com.au/health-lifestyle/lifestyle/2015/3/an-honest-account-of-our-experience-with-belle-gibson/|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=Cosmopolitan Australia|publisher=Bauer Media Group|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conventional cancer research professional from the [[Garvan Institute of Medical Research]] also went public to state that, by failing to conduct basic fact checking and providing "unfiltered PR" to Gibson's untested claims, an uncritical media had been complicit in Gibson's "scam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Liz|title='They are all complicit': Cancer researcher Dr Darren Saunders slams Belle Gibson's 'enablers'|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/they-are-all-complicit-cancer-researcher-dr-darren-saunders-slams-belle-gibsons-enablers/story-fneuzlbd-1227317296471|accessdate=23 April 2015|agency=News.com.au|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erasing the story===
Once the controversy surfaced in the media, The Whole Pantry began removing any comments made on its (since deleted) [[Facebook]] page that questioned the now suspect health and charitable claims that Gibson and the company had made, asserting that these comments only added to "the misinformation" of the initial [[Fairfax Media]] article. This selective deletion drew even more negative comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=The mystery of Belle Gibson, who claimed she cured cancer with clean living|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/29/belle-gibson-whole-pantry/|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Mashable Australia|publisher=Mashable Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, posts that Gibson had made on her Healing Belle [[Instagram]] account that made reference to her cancers or charitable donations were also being selectively deleted, drawing further negative comment to the effect that particularly Gibson's cancer-related claims were suddenly "being erased from the internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Belle Gibson Actually Have Cancer?|url=http://realitybasedmedicine.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/does-belle-gibson-actually-have-cancer.html|website=Reality Based Medicine|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, all posts were deleted from the Healing Belle and The Whole Pantry Instagram accounts. Around the same time, individual postings about her cancer, and claims of having died briefly while under heart surgery, which Gibson had made in 2009 on blogs that she did not directly control, were also being selectively deleted by the administrator of the blog "at the request of a user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guilliatt|first1=Richard|title=Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson's stories of beating terminal cancer erased from internet|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/whole-pantry-founder-belle-gibsons-stories-of-beating-terminal-cancer-erased-from-internet/story-fni0fit3-1227257742137|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Herald Sun|publisher=NewsCorp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Whole Pantry and Healing Belle accounts across a number of social media platforms were soon either abandoned, made private, or deleted in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael|first1=Sarah|last2=Dean|first2=Sarah|title=Belle Gibson's partying past reveals a love of beer, cask wine and donuts... and it's a long way from the organic regime she claims cured her 'terminal' brain cancer|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2997754/Blogger-Belle-Gibson-s-book-cancelled-U-S-wellness-empire-continues-collapse-allegations-faked-terminal-cancer.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Daily Mail Australia|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson subsequently established another [[Facebook]] account under the alias Harry Gibson, which was made private, and used to hit back at Facebook followers questioning her claims or speaking to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavanagh|first1=Rebekah|last2=Tuohy|first2=Wendy|title=Belle Gibson slams 'fake cancer' claims in online rant|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/health-blogger-and-app-developer-belle-gibson-hits-back-at-bullying-critics-20150315-144g0v.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=Herald Sun|publisher=NewsCorp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission of deceit===
In late April 2015, Gibson gave an interview to ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]'', in which she admitted to having fabricated all her cancer claims. Gibson attributed her lying to her childhood upbringing, and specifically to neglect by her now-estranged mother, claiming to having been forced to take care of herself and her brother since the age of five.&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Rebecca|title=Belle Gibson: 'No, None of it is true'|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/belle-gibson-no-none-of-it-is-true/story-fniym874-1227315232565|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=news.com.au|agency=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview was, however, described as an admission of deceit, without expression of regret or apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cunningham|first1=Matt|title=Nothing to like about this pretty little liar|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/nothing-to-like-about-this-pretty-little-liar/story-fni0ffsx-1227320920457|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=Herald Sun|publisher=NewsCorp Ltd|date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2015 interview with the same magazine, Gibson's mother Natalie Dal-Bello refuted several claims Gibson had made about her upbringing. This included the claim that her brother was autistic, even though he &amp;ndash; also interviewed for the magazine &amp;ndash; is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belle Gibson's mum slams troubled childhood claims as 'a lot of rubbish'|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/belle-gibsons-mum-slams-troubled-childhood-claims-as-a-lot-of-rubbish/story-fneuz9ev-1227358455303|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=news.com.au|agency=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson's late April 2015 interview with ''The Australian Women's Weekly'', in which she admitted faking her cancers, was arranged by [[Bespoke Approach]], and Gibson was provided ''[[pro bono]]'' representation by the company during the interview.&lt;ref name="news.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffrey|first1=James|title=Toil for the Belle|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/strewth/toil-for-the-belle/story-e6frgdk6-1227315963271|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=The Australian|publisher=NewsCorp|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Gibson was rumored to have received $45,000 for an interview with ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/belle-gibsons-60-minutes-tv-interview-sparks-criticism/story-fna045gd-1227413064805|title=Belle Gibson's 60 Minutes TV interview sparks criticism|first=Kate|last=Sullivan|date=24 Jun 2015|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stefanie Spinks wrote that "by accepting $45,000 for her interview, Belle is sending the message that people can profit off stealing, lying and taking advantage of people's good intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3138530/This-absolute-disgrace-Thousands-former-Belle-Gibson-supporters-sign-online-petition-demanding-cancer-fraud-donate-fee-upcoming-interview-charity.html|title=Thousands of former Belle Gibson supporters sign online petition demanding the cancer fraud donate any fee from upcoming interview to charity|work=Daily Mail|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this interview, she claimed to have been visited at home by a doctor named Mark Johns who had an electronic machine with paddles and lights that was "German technology" that diagnosed her cancers. She also believed she was taking oral chemotherapy prescribed by this same doctor. No one has found any trace of this person nor any information on the portable machine that was used to make a diagnosis.

===Legal action===

Consumer Affairs Victoria brought legal action against Gibson for allegedly breaking Australian consumer law. The regulator said it had conducted an in-depth investigation of Gibson's activities and applied to Australia's Federal Court for leave to pursue legal action. Gibson's publisher, Penguin Australia, has already agreed to pay A$30,000 ($22,200; ¬£15,300) to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund as a penalty for releasing The Whole Pantry, which was not fact checked.&lt;ref name="ConsumerAffairs2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belle Gibson: Australian blogger who faked cancer faces legal action|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36195825|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2017, Federal Court Justice [[Debra Mortimer]] delivered the decision that ‚Äúmost but not all‚Äù of the claims were proven.  Gibson did not appear in court for the decision.  Justice Mortimer found Gibson's claims had been misleading and deceptive, and that ‚ÄúMs Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer from the time she began making these claims in public to promote ''The Whole Pantry Book'' and the apps in mid-2013,‚Äù but there was not enough evidence to prove that she was not acting out of delusion.&lt;ref name="2017 FCA 240"&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|240|2017|litigants=Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria v Gibson |date=15 March 2017 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/03/15/06/22/belle-gibsons-judgement-to-be-handed-down-in-court|title=Disgraced wellness blogger Belle Gibson facing more than $1 million in fines|last=|first=|date=15 March 2017|work=9 News|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/belle-gibson-backs-new-health-fad-ahead-of-court-judgment/news-story/d5850eb9a6c9c4c3e4420141c2a42f6a|title=Belle Gibson backs new health fad ahead of court judgment|last=Cavanagh|first=Rebekah|date=15 March 2017|website=www.heraldsun.com.au|publisher=Herald Sun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotextiles include implantible devices such as [[surgical suture]]s, [[hernia]] repair fabrics, [[artery|arterial]] [[Medical grafting|grafts]], [[artificial skin]] and parts of [[artificial heart]]s.  They were first created 30 years ago by Dr. Martin W. King, a professor in [[North Carolina State University]]‚Äôs College of Textiles[http://www.tx.ncsu.edu/faculty_center/directory/detail.cfm?id=63]. 

'''Medical textiles''' are a broader group which also includes bandages, wound dressings, hospital linen, preventive clothing etc.  [[Antiseptic]] biotextiles are textiles used in fighting against [[cutaneous]] [[bacteria]]l proliferation.  [[Zeolite]] and [[triclosan]] are at the present time the most used molecules.  This original property allows to fightinhibits the development of odours or bacterial proliferation in the diabetic foot.

== New developments ==

In the new paradigm of [[tissue engineering]], professionals are trying to develop new textiles so that the body can form new tissue around these devices so it‚Äôs not relying solely on synthetic foreign implanted material.  Graduate student Jessica Gluck has demonstrated that viable and functioning liver cells can be grown on textile scaffolds [http://www.physorg.com/news96302396.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12416">'''Bleed air''' produced by [[gas turbine]] engines is [[compressed air]] that is taken from the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations."&lt;ref name="777 Bleed Air"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meriweather.com/flightdeck/777/over/bleed.html | title=777 Bleed Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global 300 Bleed Air"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/download.php?path=docs/&amp;file=Bombardier_Challenger_Global_300-Air_Cond_and_Press.pdf | title=Global 300 Bleed Air}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, [[cabin pressurization]], [[pneumatic actuator]]s, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as "customer bleed air".&lt;ref name="US Navy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/eng/64b7-205.html | title=Naval Operations Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Space Agency"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easa.europa.eu/certification/type-certificates/docs/engines/EASA-TCDS-E.021_%28IM%29_GE_CF34--10E_series_engines-05-03012013.pdf | title=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mil-specs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mil-spec.tpub.com/MIL-E/MIL-E-8593A/MIL-E-8593A00103.htm | title=mil-spec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high [[temperature]] and high [[pressure]] (typical values are 200‚Äì250&amp;nbsp;¬∞C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).

== Uses ==
[[File:Pxctl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cabin pressure and bleed air controls in a [[Boeing 737-800]]]]
In civil aircraft, bleed air's primary use is to provide pressure for the aircraft [[cabin (aircraft)|cabin]] by supplying air to the [[environmental control system]]. Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the plane (such as the wing [[leading edge]]s) ice-free.&lt;ref name="skybrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Bleed_Air_Systems | title=Bleed Air Systems | publisher=Skybrary.aero | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleed air is used on many aircraft systems because it is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, bleed air from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines. [[Aircraft lavatory|Lavatory]] water storage tanks are pressurized by bleed air that is fed through a [[pressure regulator]].&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;

When used for [[cabin pressurization]], the bleed air from the engine must first be cooled (as it exits the compressor stage at temperatures as high as 250&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) by passing it through an air-to-air [[heat exchanger]] cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an [[air cycle machine]] unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;

Bleed air is also used to heat the engine [[intake]]s. This prevents ice from forming, accumulating, breaking loose, and being ingested by the engine, possibly damaging it.&lt;ref name="skybrary2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Ice_Protection_Systems | title=Ice Protection Systems | publisher=Skybrary | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On aircraft powered by jet engines, a similar system is used for [[Ice protection system|wing anti-icing]] by the 'hot-wing' method. In icing conditions, water droplets [[condensation|condensing]] on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes the shape of the wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or [[Lift (force)|lift]]. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.

On propeller-driven aircraft, it is common to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot on the leading edge, breaking the ice loose after it has already formed.&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skybrary2" /&gt;

Bleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine is used to supply [[Harrier Jump Jet#Specifications|reaction control valves]] as used for part of the [[flight control system]] in the [[Harrier jump jet]] family of military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.harrier.org.uk/technical/Basic_TechNet.htm Technical]" page on harrier.org.uk website, viewed 2013-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contamination==
{{Main|Fume event}}
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
On rare occasions, bleed air used for air-conditioning, and pressurization can be contaminated by chemicals such as oil or hydraulic fluid.&lt;ref name=WSJ_&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628 | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About ‚ÄòFume Events‚Äô on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=29 December 2012 | author=Sarah Nassauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such rare events have not been established to cause long term harm.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628 | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About 'Fume Events' on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=July 30, 2009 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Nassauer, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skydrol.com/pages/faqs.asp | title=Skydrol FAQ | publisher=Skydrol | accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain neurological and respiratory ill health effects have been linked [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotally]] to exposure to bleed air that has been alleged to have been contaminated with toxic levels on commercial and military aircraft. This alleged long-term illness is referred to as [[Aerotoxic Syndrome]] by agenda groups, but it is not a medically recognized syndrome. One alleged potential contaminant is [[tricresyl phosphate]].

Many lobbying groups have been set up to advocate for research into this alleged hazard. The groups include the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based [[Aerotoxic Association]] (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.acer-coe.org/index.html|title= Airliner Cabin Environment Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their researchers have not yet established any [[Causality|causal relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf | title=The Aerotoxic Syndrome | publisher=European Society of Aerospace Medicine | date=September 2008 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Bagshaw, Michael | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827071537/http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf | archivedate=August 27, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/121/12107.htm|author=Select Committee on Science and Technology|publisher=House of Lords|title=Science and Technology ‚Äì Fifth Report|chapter=Chapter 4: Elements Of Healthy Cabin Air|accessdate=2010-07-05|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a study made for the EU in 2014 confirmed that contamination of cabin air could be a problem, that study also stated:

::"A lot of reported fume events caused comfort limitations for the occupants but posed no danger. A verification of cabin air contamination with toxic substances (e.g. TCP/TOCP) was not possible with the fume events the BFU investigated."&lt;ref name="EU Study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bfu-web.de/EN/Publications/Safety%20Study/Studies/140507_Fume_Events.pdf?__blob=publicationFile | title=Study of Reported Occurrences in Conjunction with Cabin Air Quality in Transport Aircraft | publisher=German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation | accessdate=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no scientific evidence to date has found that airliner cabin air has been contaminated to toxic levels (exceeding known safe levels, in ppm, of any dangerous chemical), a court in Australia in March 2010, found in favor of a former airline flight attendant who claimed she suffered chronic respiratory problems after being exposed to oil fumes on a trip in March 1992, although she was able to continue working as a flight attendant and in other jobs for over 10 years after the fume event&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWDDT/2009/10.html Turner v Eastwest Airlines Limited (2009) at Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleedless aircraft ==
Bleed air systems have been in use for several decades in passenger jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems to be replaced by electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]], each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/AERO_Q407_article2.pdf AERO 787 No Bleed Systems] The Boeing Company 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
A bleedless aircraft achieves fuel efficiency by eliminating the process of compressing and decompressing air, and by reducing the aircraft's mass due to the removal of ducts, valves, heat exchangers, and other heavy equipment.&lt;ref name="boeing"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/article_02_1.html | title=787 No-Bleed Systems | publisher=Boeing | year=2008 | accessdate=January 1, 2013 | author=Sinnett, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APU (auxiliary power unit) does not need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are improved due to the lack of bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure [[air cycle machine]] (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.&lt;ref name="boeing" /&gt;

Lastly, advocates of the design say it improves safety as heated air is confined to the engine pod, as opposed to being pumped through pipes and heat exchangers in the wing and near the cabin, where a leak could damage surrounding systems.&lt;ref name="boeing" /&gt;

===Tradeoffs===
In the 787, cabin air enters from under the fuselage and is compressed as required. De-icing is achieved by electro-thermal heating elements embedded in the wing's leading edge. Hydraulic pumps for flaps, slats, speed brakes and other control surfaces are also powered electrically.

Eliminating bleed air increases the electric load, as cabin pressurization, anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions need to be powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-power power distribution boards and more sophisticated backup and control systems.

'''Catherine Foster''' (born 1975)&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; is an English operatic soprano, who has appeared internationally, mostly in European opera houses. Her repertoire has focused on [[dramatic soprano]] roles in stage works by [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Richard Wagner]], such as the title role of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', and Br√ºnnhilde in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', a role which she performed at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 2013 for Wagner's bicentenary.

== Career ==
Born in [[Nottingham]],&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Foster played several musical instruments as a girl, and was a lead chorister in the choir of the village church from age 15.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; She worked first as a nurse and midwife for 15 years.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasagar" /&gt; Beginning in 1993 she studied voice with [[Pamela Cook]], who trained her until her death in 2013. Foster studied at the [[Birmingham Conservatoire]] from 1995. As a recipient of the [[Dame Eva Turner Awards]], she studied on a scholarship at the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and completed her studies at the [[National Opera Studio]] in London in 1999. During her studies, she performed as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' at the [[Opera of Northern Ireland]] in 1998 and the [[Welsh National Opera]]. She repeated the role when she sang at the [[English National Opera]] for the first time in 2000.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;

She became a member of the [[Nationaltheater Weimar]] in 2001, where she first performed roles &lt;!-- jugendlich-dramatischen Soprans --&gt;such as Mimi in Puccini's ''[[La Boh√®me]]'', Elisabeth in Wagner's  ''[[Tannh√§user (opera)|Tannh√§user]]'', Leonore in both Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'' and Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Senta in Wagner's ''[[Der Fliegende Holl√§nder]]'', Abigaille in Verdi's ''[[Nabucco]]'' and Elektra in Mozart's ''[[Idomeneo]]''.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;

She changed to the [[Dramatic soprano|dramatic]] repertory, appearing in title roles of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' by Richard Strauss, Wagner's ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' and Puccini's ''[[Turandot]]''. In 2007, she performed the role of Br√ºnnhilde in Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in three parts of the cycle.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt; The production was recorded on DVD and made her known. From 2011, she has worked as a freelance singer.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;

She made her debut at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 2013 as Br√ºnnhilde in the ''Ring'' production staged by [[Frank Castorf]], on the occasion of the bicentenary of Wagner's birth.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasagar" /&gt; She performed the role also in the following years, conducted by [[Kirill Petrenko]], [[Marek Janowski]] and [[Pl√°cido Domingo]]. The production was recorded and broadcast internationally in 2016.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt; She said in an interview that she never received acting training, but "I worked for almost 15 years in a hospital and had many experiences with young and old people, with children, rich and poor, happy and sad people. This is the experience I bring to the stage."&lt;ref name="Vasagar" /&gt;

She appeared as Br√ºnnhilde also at the [[Staatstheater Wiesbaden]], in 2017 as part of the [[Internationale Maifestspiele]]. A critic wrote after a performance of ''G√∂tterd√§mmerung'': "Phrasing, understanding and pronunciation of the text, secure intonation and scenic presence are on an unusually high level! This evening, Ms. Foster succeeded in everything! Her voice was perfectly controlled in all registers up to 'C'" ("Phrasierung, Texterfassung und -Verst√§ndlichkeit, Intonationssicherheit, szenische Pr√§senz sind auf auf einem au√üerordentlich hohen Niveau! An diesem Abend gelang Frau Foster alles! Die Stimme blieb in allen Lagen perfekt kontrolliert bis rauf zum 'C'").&lt;ref name="Schau√ü" /&gt;

In concert, she sang in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] at the [[Wiener Musikverein]], in his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in the UK. She performed Wagner's  [[Wesendonck Lieder]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth" /&gt;

A '''cherry-red spot''' is a finding in the [[macula]] of the [[eye]] in a variety of [[lipid storage]] disorders and in [[central retinal artery occlusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1577451524 General Practice Notebook]&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes the appearance of a small circular choroid shape as seen through the [[fovea centralis]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cherry-red+spot Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its appearance is due to a relative transparency of the macula; storage disorders cause the accumulation of storage material within the cell layers of the retina, however, the macula, which is relatively devoid of cellular layers, does not build up this material, and thus allows the eye to see through the macula to the red choroid below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpgmonline.com/text.asp?2008/54/1/54/39196 Suvarna JC, Hajela SA. Cherry-red spot. J Postgrad Med 2008;54:54-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign was first described by Warren Tay, founding member of the British Ophthalmological Society, in 1881, with reference to a patient with [[Tay‚ÄìSachs disease]].

The cherry red spot is seen in central retinal artery occlusion, appearing several hours after the blockage of the [[retinal artery]] occurs.&lt;ref name="Rakel"&gt;Rakel, Robert E., Textbook of Family Medicine, 7th ed, Chapter 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The cherry red spot is seen because the macula receives its blood supply from the choroid, supplied by the [[long posterior ciliary arteries|long]] and [[short posterior ciliary arteries]], while the surrounding retina is pale due to retinal artery infarction.&lt;ref&gt;""USMLE First AID 2010 page 417&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen in several other conditions, classically Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, but also in [[Niemann‚ÄìPick disease]], [[Sandhoff disease]], and [[mucolipidosis]].

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In an [[insurance]] policy, the '''deductible''' is the amount paid
[[Out-of-pocket expenses|out of pocket]] by the policy holder before an insurance provider will pay any expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = O'Sullivan |first = Arthur |authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2 = Steven M. |last2 = Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year = 2003 |location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |page = 524 |isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term ''deductible'' may be used to describe one of several types of clauses that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments.

Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings.{{fact|date=November 2015}} As a result, [[insurance premium]]s are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles. For example, health insurance companies offer plans with high premiums and low deductibles, or plans with low premiums and high deductibles. One plan may have a premium of $1,087 a month with a $6,000 deductible, while a competitive plan may have a premium of $877 a month with a $12,700 deductible. The consumer with the $6,000 deductible will have to pay $6,000 in health care costs before the insurance plan pays anything. The consumer with the $12,700 deductible will have to pay $12,700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/21/news/economy/obamacare-affordable/ How 'affordable' are Obamacare plans?] By Tami Luhby, CNN, November 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and are a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year. For policies where incidents are not easy to delimit (health insurance, for example), the deductible is typically applied per year.

Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim. For example, a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural calamities, evacuation etc.

There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an automobile, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.

== Vs. franchise ==
A deductible should not be confused with a franchise. Where a deductible represents a part of the expense for which the insurer is not liable, the franchise is a pure threshold that, when exceeded, transfers liability for the ''entire'' expense to the insurer. For example, with a franchise of $20,000, a claim of $19,900 is borne entirely by the policy holder and a claim of $20,500 is borne entirely by the insurer.

== Vs. excess ==
An '''excess''' can refer to one of two very different insurance terms.

The first is '''excess-post-hospitalization''' which refers to the extra costs borne by the insured over and above the maximum coverage that the insurance company pays. This terminology is especially common in areas of insurance sensitive to loss (like [[liability insurance]]) and is addressed by the insurance market through [[Insurance#Insurance companies|excess line insurance companies]] through mechanisms like [[excess insurance]], [[gap insurance]], and [[umbrella insurance]].

The second is '''excess-pre-hospitalization''' which refers to an insurance exception that is (often interchangeably but wrongly) referred to also as an '''excess''' or a '''deductible'''. It is "the first amount of the claim which the insured has to bear. If the insured has an excess of $500 and the total repair costs $3,000, then the insured has to pay $500 while the insurer pays the remaining $2,500."&lt;ref name="Vehicle Owners FAQ"&gt;From Vehicle Owners FAQ on Singapore's Auto Insurance: http://www.vehicleowners.com/FAQExcessFreeInfo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automobile and property insurance ==
In a typical [[automobile insurance]] policy, a deductible will apply to claims arising from damage to or loss of the policy holder's own vehicle, whether this damage/loss is caused by [[car accident|accidents]] for which the holder is responsible, or [[vandalism]] and [[theft]]. Depending on the policy, the deductible may differ based on the type of expense incurred that triggers the insurance claim.&lt;ref name="Vehicle Owners FAQ"/&gt;

Third-party [[legal liability|liability]] coverages including auto liability, general liability, garagekeepers, inland marine, professional liability and workers compensation are also written with deductibles.  These deductibles on commercial liability policies are known as third party deductibles or liability deductibles.  Because the insured and claimant are not the same entity, insurers cannot pay the claim minus the deductible.  This creates a receivable owed from the insured to the insurer.  Due to the complexity of identifying these third party deductible receivables, many are often missed by the insurer causing millions of dollars to go uncollected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Warnagiris |authorlink= |title= Collecting Third Party Deductibles |url=http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2009/02/02/collecting-third-party-deductibles|work=|publisher= Claims Magazine |date=  February 2009|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and travel insurance ==
{{Main article|Copayment}}

Most [[health insurance]] policies and some [[travel insurance]] policies have deductibles as well. The type of health insurance deductibles can also vary, as individual amounts and family amounts.

Given the nature of medical treatment, the insured often faces multiple medical expenses spread over several days for a single illness or injury. Due to this reason, health insurance deductibles often tend to be imposed on a term basis (e.g. annually) as opposed to a per-visit threshold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ups.edu/humanresources/2006_benefits/Benefits2006-FAQ.htm#co-payments What is the difference between co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles?]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, major medical insurance policies may have a per-visit excess which often does not cover the cost of routine visits to a GP, unless it is certified to be a part of a continuous treatment (and the bills can be collated in a single claim).

== Industrial and commercial insurance ==
In industrial risks it is also common for the deductible to be expressed as a percentage of the loss, often though not always, with a minimum and maximum amount. This is similar to [[co-insurance]], where the company pays a certain percentage of the losses, coupled with minimum and maximum payment thresholds. For example, with a deductible of 10% with a minimum of $1,500 and maximum of $5,000, a claim of $25,000 would incur a deductible of $2,500 (i.e. 10% of the loss) and the resulting payment would be $22,500. A claim below $15,000 would incur the minimum deductible of $1,500 and a claim above $50,000 would incur the maximum deductible of $5,000.

'''Family Service Agency of San Francisco''' (FSA) was founded in 1889 as Associated Charities by [[Katharine Felton]] (1873-1940). FSASF is the oldest nonsectarian, nonprofit charitable social-services provider in the [[City and County of San Francisco]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} It relies on contributions from government, private donors, and private clients.

FSA focuses on strengthening families by providing caring, effective, and innovative [[social services]], with special emphasis on the needs of low-income [[Family|families]], [[children]], and the [[elderly]], and disabled people, thus improving the quality of life for all San Franciscans.

This article deals with the [[fireworks]] policy in [[Belgium]].

The sales of [[fireworks]] in Belgium is federally regulated. Since 5 July 2017, the sale of European category F3 fireworks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making fireworks in the EU safer |url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/making-fireworks-eu-safer-0_nn |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=27 January 2018 |quote=

As of 2017, Belgium does not have a federal policy on the lighting of fireworks, although such regulations have been announced in 2015.&lt;ref name="OVV"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1679/f73dc5c1f5e020172659-publicatie-veiligheidsrisico-s-jaarwisseling-interactief-171127.pdf |title=Veiligheidsrisico‚Äôs jaarwisseling |publisher=[[Dutch Safety Board]] |date=1 December 2017 |accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Flanders]], the ''[[:nl:Gemeentedecreet|Gemeentedecreet]]'' (Municipal Decree) gives the [[List of municipalities of the Flemish Region|308 municipalities of the Flemish Region]] the authority to introduce a required [[licence]] for lighting fireworks, or to prohibit the ignition of fireworks on certain locations.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt; In almost all Flemish municipalities, an individual can only get a licence in special circumstances (such as [[weddings]]). During [[New Year's Eve]], lighting fireworks without a licence is allowed in 35% of the municipalities, in around 50% a permit from the [[burgemeester]] ([[mayor]]) is required, and around 14% of municipalities have banned consumer fireworks altogether.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt;

In many major cities, professional fireworks shows are held, attended by tens of thousands of people.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15322">The '''general medical examination''' is a common form of [[preventive medicine]] involving visits to a [[general practitioner]] by well feeling adults on a regular basis. This is generally yearly or less frequently. It is known under various non-specific names, such as the '''periodic health evaluation''', '''annual physical''', '''comprehensive medical exam''', '''general health check''', '''preventive health examination''', '''medical check-up''', or simply '''medical'''.

In the United Kingdom, the examination remains unpopular with the general populace.&lt;ref name=Si2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Si|first=S|author2=Moss, JR |author3=Sullivan, TR |author4=Newton, SS |author5= Stocks, NP |title=Effectiveness of general practice-based health checks: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|date=Jan 2014|volume=64|issue=618|pages=e47-53|pmid=24567582|doi=10.3399/bjgp14x676456|pmc=3876170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coch2012/&gt;

The term is generally ''not'' meant to include visits for the purpose of newborn checks, [[Papanicolaou smear|Pap smear]]s for [[cervical cancer]], or regular visits for people with certain [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] medical disorders (for example, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]).&lt;ref name="pmid17310053"/&gt; The general medical examination generally involves a [[medical history]], a (brief or complete) [[physical examination]] and sometimes [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography.

If necessary, the patient may be sent to a [[medical specialist]] for further, more detailed examinations.

==Evidence==
Although annual medical examinations are a routine practice in several countries, it is poorly supported by [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]] in the majority of the population. A 2012 [[Cochrane review]] did not find any benefit with respect to the risk of death or poor outcomes related to disease in those who received them.&lt;ref name=Coch2012&gt;{{cite journal|title=General health checks in adults for reducing morbidity and mortality from disease|date=Oct 17, 2012|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009009.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009009.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=53C3360857C2E2AC3DE4012D34C67F01.d01t04|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who undergo yearly medical exams however are more likely to be diagnosed with medical problems.&lt;ref name=Coch2012/&gt;

Some notable health organisations recommend against annual examinations.&lt;ref name="USPSTF"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force.

A [[systematic review]] of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions (such as Pap smears, [[cholesterol]] screening, and [[faecal occult blood|faecal occult blood tests]]) and less patient worry.&lt;ref name="pmid17310053"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Boulware LE, Marinopoulos S, Phillips KA, etal |title=Systematic review: the value of the periodic health evaluation |journal=Ann.

The lack of good evidence contrasts with population surveys showing that the general public is fond of these examinations, especially when they are free of charge.&lt;ref name="pmid11992300"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oboler SK, Prochazka AV, Gonzales R, Xu S, Anderson RJ |title=Public expectations and attitudes for annual physical examinations and testing |journal=Ann.

Most surgeons ask patients about recent general medical examination results in order to proceed with surgery [1] even though there are arguments for and against most [[screening (medicine)|screening]] interventions. Advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment of conditions such as [[high blood pressure]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[smoking]], [[Reference Daily Intake|unhealthy diet]], [[obesity]] and [[cancer]]s. Moreover, they could improve the [[patient-physician relationship]] and decrease patient [[anxiety]]. More and more private insurance companies and even Medicare include annual physicals in their coverage. Some employers require mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients (as opposed to people with symptoms or known illnesses) are statistically more likely to be ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù ‚Äî that is, when test results suggest a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist.&lt;ref name="health.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A checkup for the checkup: Do you really need a yearly physical? - Harvard Health Blog|url = http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-checkup-for-the-checkup-do-you-really-need-a-yearly-physical-201510238473|website = Harvard Health Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by targeted screening ([[health economics]] argument),&lt;ref name="pmid12660210"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarnall KS, Pollak KI, √òstbye T, Krause KM, Michener JL |title=Primary care: is there enough time for prevention? |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=635‚Äì41 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12660210 |pmc=1447803 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.93.4.635|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12660210}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased anxiety over health risks ([[medicalisation]]), [[overdiagnosis]], wrong diagnosis (for example [[Athletic heart syndrome]] misdiagnosed as [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]) and harm, or even death, resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm, often non-existent, medical problems or while performing routine procedures as a followup after screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = What went wrong with Joan Rivers‚Äôs last medical procedure: lawsuit|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/28/what-went-wrong-with-joan-riverss-last-medical-procedure-lawsuit/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-01-28|access-date = 2015-11-08|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Emily|last = Yahr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Minnesota teen Sydney Galleger dies after dental procedure|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/minnesota-teen-dies-after-dental-procedure/|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Three Georgia boys die unexpectedly after dental procedure|url = http://www.cbs46.com/story/17793876/3-georiga-boys-die-unexpectedly-after-dental-proceedure|website = www.cbs46.com|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
It is commonly performed in the United States and Japan, whereas the practice varies among South East Asia and mainland European countries. In Japan it is required by law for regular working employees to check once a year, with a much more thorough battery of tests than other countries.

==History==
The roots of the periodic medical examination are not entirely clear. They seem to have been advocated since the 1920s.&lt;ref name="JAMA1923"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emerson H |title=Periodic medical examinations of apparently healthy persons |journal=JAMA |volume=80 |issue= |pages=1376‚Äì1381 |year=1923 |pmid= |doi= 10.1001/jama.1923.26430460003011|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors point to pleads from the 19th and early 20th century for the early detection of diseases like [[tuberculosis]], and periodic school health examinations.&lt;ref name="pmid9382370"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Han PK |title=Historical changes in the objectives of the periodic health examination |journal=Ann.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="979">'''Genetic significant dose''' (GSD), or '''genetically significant dose''', was initially defined by [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9525414 | volume=74 | title=An estimation of the genetically significant dose from diagnostic radiology for the South African population, 1990-1991 | year=1998 | journal=Health Phys | pages=419‚Äì28 | last1 = Hering | first1 = ER | last2 = Kotze | first2 = TJ | last3 = Maree | first3 = GJ | doi=10.1097/00004032-199804000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It represents an estimate of the [[genetics|genetic]] significance of [[gonad]] radiation doses. Annual GSD is calculated by weighting the individual gonad doses received during [[ionizing]] imaging by the number of individual examined, and accounting for the number of [[offspring]] for each individual.

A '''granulosa cell''' or '''follicular cell''' is a [[somatic cell]] of the [[sex cord]] that is closely associated with the developing female [[gamete]] (called an [[oocyte]] or egg) in the [[ovary]] of [[mammal]]s.

==Structure and function==
In the primary [[ovarian follicle]], and later in follicle development ([[folliculogenesis]]), granulosa cells advance to form a multilayered [[cumulus oophorus]] surrounding the [[oocyte]] in the preovulatory or [[antral follicle|antral]] (or Graafian) follicle.

The major functions of granulosa cells include the production of [[sex steroid]]s, as well as myriad growth factors thought to interact with the [[oocyte]] during its development. The sex steroid production begins with [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the anterior pituitary, stimulating granulosa cells to convert [[androgens]] (coming from the [[thecal cell]]s) to [[estradiol]] by [[aromatase]] during the [[follicular phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after ovulation the granulosa cells turn into [[granulosa lutein cell]]s that produce [[progesterone]].  The progesterone may maintain a potential pregnancy and causes production of a thick cervical mucus that inhibits sperm entry into the uterus.

== Embryology of ovarian granulosa cells ==
In the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]], the [[oogonia]] become invaginated in the [[gonadal ridge]].

The embryological origin of granulosa cells remains controversial. In the 1970s, evidence emerged that the first cells to make contact with the oogonia were of mesonephric origin. It was suggested that mesonephric cells already closely associated with the oogonia proliferated throughout development to form the granulosa cell layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Satoh M | title = Histogenesis and organogenesis of the gonad in human embryos | journal = J Anat | volume = 177 | issue = | pages = 85‚Äì107 | year = 1991| pmid = 1769902 | pmc = 1260417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Upadhyay S, Zamboni L | title = Preliminary observations on the role of the mesonephros in the development of the adrenal cortex | journal = Anat Rec | volume = 202 | issue = 1 | pages = 105‚Äì111 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7059014 | doi = 10.1002/ar.1092020112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zamboni | first1 = L. | last2 = Bezard | first2 = J. | last3 = Mauleon | first3 = P. | year = 1979 | title = The role of the mesonephros in the development of the sheep fetal ovary | url = | journal = Annales de Biologie Animal Biochimie et Biophysique | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1153‚Äì78 | doi=10.1051/rnd:19790801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged with some thorough [[histology]]. Sawyer et al. hypothesized that in sheep most of the granulosa cells develop from cells of the [[mesothelium]] (i.e., epithelial cells from the presumptive surface epithelium of the ovary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sawyer H, Smith P, Heath D, Juengel J, Wakefield S, McNatty K | title = Formation of ovarian follicles during fetal development in sheep | journal = Biol Reprod | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1134‚Äì50 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11906935 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod66.4.1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was proposed that both granulosa cells and the ovarian surface epithelial cells are instead derived from a precursor cell called gonadal-ridge epithelial-like cell.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hummitzsch|first1=K|last2=Irving-Rodgers|first2=HF|last3=Hatzirodos|first3=N|last4=Bonner|first4=W|last5=Sabatier|first5=L|last6=Reinhardt|first6=DP|last7=Sado|first7=Y|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y|last9=Wilhelm|first9=D|last10=Rodgers|first10=RJ|title=A new model of development of the mammalian ovary and follicles.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e55578|pmid=23409002|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055578|pmc=3567121}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell culture==
[[Cell culture]] of granulosa cells can be performed ''[[in vitro]]''. [[Plating density]] (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for the differentiation. A lower plating density makes granulosa cells exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as [[progesterone]] producing [[theca lutein cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Portela VM, Zamberlam G, Price CA |title=Cell plating density alters the ratio of estrogenic to progestagenic enzyme gene expression in cultured granulosa cells |journal=Fertil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39761">[[File:Marketvegetables.jpg|thumb|Leafy green, [[allium]], and [[cruciferous vegetables]] are key components of a healthy diet]]
A '''healthy diet''' is a [[dieting|diet]] that helps to maintain or improve overall [[health]]. A healthy diet provides the body with essential [[Human nutrition|nutrition]]: fluid, [[macronutrient]]s, [[micronutrient]]s, and adequate [[calorie]]s.&lt;ref name="lean"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |issue = 2|pages = 61‚Äì65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42716/9241546123.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no [[processed food]] and [[sweetened beverage]]s.  The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of [[vitamin B12]] is needed for those following a [[vegan diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melina|first1=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|date=December 2016|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1970‚Äì1980|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|pmid=27886704}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. [[Nutrition facts label]]s are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.&lt;ref name=EU1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32011R1169|title=Food information to consumers - legislation|work=EU|accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet. A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=lean/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO123&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Promoting fruit and vegetable consumption around the world |work=WHO |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are specialized healthy diets, called [[medical nutrition therapy]], for people with various diseases or conditions.  There are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets, as in [[Chinese food therapy|dietary therapy in traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Recommendations==

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/diet/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Diet |work=WHO |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.
# Limit intake of fats. Not more than 30% of the total calories should come from fats. Prefer [[unsaturated fats]] to [[saturated fats]]. Avoid [[trans fats]].
# Eat at least 400 grams of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] per day (potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots do not count). A healthy diet also contains [[legumes]] (e.g. lentils, beans), [[whole grains]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. 
# Limit the intake of simple [[sugar]]s to less than 10% of calorie (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO guideline : sugar consumption recommendation|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/sugar-guideline/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Limit [[salt]] / [[sodium]] from all sources and ensure that [[Iodised salt|salt is iodized]]. Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/unhealthy_diet_text/en/|title=WHO - Unhealthy diet|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO stated that insufficient [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other WHO recommendations include ensuring that foods chosen have sufficient [[vitamins]] and certain minerals, avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g. [[benzene]]) substances, avoiding foods contaminated by human [[pathogens]] (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'', [[tapeworm]] eggs), and replacing saturated fats with [[polyunsaturated fat]]s in the diet can reduce the risk of [[coronary artery disease]] and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

=== United States Department of Agriculture ===
{{main|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
{{main|MyPlate}}
The [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) recommends three healthy patterns of diet, summarized in table below, for a 2000 kcal diet.&lt;ref&gt;Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. "[http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/PDFs/Scientific-Report-of-the-2015-Dietary-Guidelines-Advisory-Committee.pdf Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee]." ''Washington (DC): USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

It emphasizes both health and environmental sustainability and a flexible approach: the committee that drafted it wrote: "The major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-style Pattern,‚Äù the ‚ÄúHealthy Vegetarian Pattern," and the "Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = App. E-3.7: Developing Vegetarian and Mediterranean-style Food Patterns - 2015 Advisory Report - health.gov|url = http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/15-appendix-E3/e3-7.asp|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food group amounts are per day, unless noted per week.

===American Heart Association / World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research===
The [[American Heart Association]], [[World Cancer Research Fund]], and [[American Institute for Cancer Research]] recommend a diet that consists mostly of unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis a wide range of whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet is full of a wide range of various non-starchy vegetables and fruits, that provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. They note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [[cruciferous vegetables]] like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including ‚Äúfast foods‚Äù and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall, researchers and medical policy conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer.&lt;ref name=WCR2007&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.aicr.org/assets/docs/pdf/reports/Second_Expert_Report.pdf |title=Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective |format= |work=Washington DC: AICR, 2007 |isbn= 978-0-9722522-2-5 |accessdate=|date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlwww.cancer.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002577-pdf.pdf |title=American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention |format= |work=Last Revised: 1/11/2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard School of Public Health===
{{further information|Healthy eating pyramid}}
The Nutrition Source of [[Harvard School of Public Health]] makes the following 10 recommendations for a healthy diet:&lt;ref name=nsm&gt;{{cite web|title=What Should I Eat?|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/index.html|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69bS0fblI?url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/index.html|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose good carbohydrates: whole grains (the less processed the better), vegetables, fruits and beans. Avoid white bread, white rice, and the like as well as pastries, sugared sodas, and other highly processed food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/carbohydrates/index.html|title=Carbohydrates|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013735/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/carbohydrates/index.html|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pay attention to the protein package: good choices include fish, poultry, nuts, and beans. Try to avoid red meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/protein-full-story/|title=Protein: Moving Closer to Center Stage|accessdate=October 1, 2014|date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose foods containing healthy fats. Plant oils, nuts, and fish are the best choices. Limit consumption of saturated fats, and avoid foods with trans fat.&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;
* Choose a [[Dietary fiber|fiber]]-filled diet which includes whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fiber/index.html|title=The Bottom Line: Choose a fiber-filled diet, rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eat more vegetables and fruits‚Äîthe more colorful and varied, the better.&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;
* Include adequate amounts of [[calcium]] in the diet; however, milk is not the best or only source. Good sources of calcium are collards, bok choy, fortified soy milk, baked beans, and supplements containing calcium and vitamin D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/calcium-and-milk/index.html|title=The Bottom Line: Calcium is important.

* Prefer [[water]] over other beverages. Avoid sugary drinks, and limit intake of juices and milk. Coffee, tea, artificially-sweetened drinks, 100-percent fruit juices, low-fat milk and alcohol can fit into a healthy diet but are best consumed in moderation. Sports drinks are recommended only for people who exercise more than an hour at a stretch to replace substances lost in sweat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/healthy-drinks-full-story/index.html|title=The Nutrition Source Healthy Beverage Guidelines|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Limit salt intake. Choose more fresh foods, instead of processed ones.&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;
* Drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in moderation. Doing so has health benefits, but is not recommended for everyone.&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;
* Consider intake of daily [[multivitamin]] and extra [[vitamin D]], as these have potential health benefits.&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;

Other than nutrition, the guide recommends frequent [[physical exercise]] and maintaining a healthy [[body weight]].&lt;ref name=nsm /&gt;

===Others===
[[David L. Katz]], who reviewed the most prevalent popular diets in 2014, noted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches.

Efforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz DL, Meller S |title=Can we say what diet is best for health? |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=35 |pages=83‚Äì103 |year=2014 |pmid=24641555 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marion Nestle]] expresses the mainstream view among scientists who study nutrition:&lt;ref name="fitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fitzgerald M |title=Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US |year=2014 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=978-1-60598-560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic principles of good diets are so simple that I can summarize them in just ten words: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. For additional clarification, a five-word modifier helps: go easy on [[junk food]]s. Follow these precepts and you will go a long way toward preventing the major diseases of our overfed society‚Äîcoronary heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, stroke, osteoporosis, and a host of others.... These precepts constitute the bottom line of what seem to be the far more complicated dietary recommendations of many health organizations and national and international governments‚Äîthe forty-one ‚Äúkey recommendations‚Äù of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, for example. ... Although you may feel as though advice about nutrition is constantly changing, the basic ideas behind my four precepts have not changed in half a century. And they leave plenty of room for enjoying the pleasures of food.&lt;ref name=Nestle2006&gt;{{cite book|title=What to Eat|author=Nestle, Marion|year=2006|publisher=North Point Press (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|location=New York|isbn=978-0-86547-738-4|pages=611|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==For specific conditions==
In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with [[high blood pressure]] (as in [[low sodium diet]]s or the more specific [[DASH diet]]), or people who are [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]] (in [[dieting|weight control diets]]). However, some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.

===Hypertension===
A [[low sodium diet]] is beneficial for people with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet has a useful effect to reduce blood pressure, both in people with [[hypertension]] and in people with normal blood pressure.&lt;ref name=cochrane2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = He FJ, MacGregor GA | year = 2004 | title = Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 3| page = CD004937 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004937 | pmid=15266549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DASH diet]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a [[dieting|diet]] promoted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (part of the [[NIH]], a United States government organization) to control [[hypertension]]. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of [[sodium]],&lt;ref name="dashguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf|title=Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also "rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein".

The [[Mediterranean diet]], which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;ref name="Walker C, Reamy BV 2009 571‚Äì8"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker C, Reamy BV |title=Diets for cardiovascular disease prevention: what is the evidence? |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=571‚Äì7 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19378874 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obesity===
{{Further information|Dieting}}
Weight control diets aim to maintain a controlled weight. In most cases, those who are [[overweight]] or [[obese]] use dieting in combination with [[physical exercise]] to [[weight loss|lose weight]].

Diets to promote [[weight loss]] are divided into four categories: [[low-fat diet|low-fat]], [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]], [[calorie restriction|low-calorie]], and [[very low calorie diet|very low calorie]].&lt;ref name=Strychar&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strychar I |title=Diet in the management of weight loss |journal=CMAJ |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=56‚Äì63 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16389240 |pmc=1319349 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045037 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/174/1/56}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2‚Äì4 kilogram weight loss in all studies.&lt;ref name=Strychar/&gt;  At two years, all of the diets in the studies that reduced calories caused equal weight loss regardless of whether changes in fat or carbohydrate consumption were emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sacks FM, Bray GA, Carey VJ, etal |title=Comparison of weight-loss diets with different compositions of fat, protein, and carbohydrates |journal=N.

==Unhealthy diets==
The [[Western pattern diet]] which is typically eaten by Americans and increasingly adopted by people in the developing world as they leave poverty is unhealthy: it is "rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloomfield|first1=HE|last2=Kane|first2=R|last3=Koeller|first3=E|last4=Greer|first4=N|last5=MacDonald|first5=R|last6=Wilt|first6=T|title=Benefits and Harms of the Mediterranean Diet Compared to Other Diets|journal=VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program Reports.|date=November 2015|pmid=27559560|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0089086/pdf/PubMedHealth_PMH0089086.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including: [[high blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], abnormal blood lipids, [[overweight]]/[[obesity]], [[cardiovascular diseases]], and cancer.&lt;ref name=WHOD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Diet and physical activity: a public health priority |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO estimates that 2.7 million deaths are attributable to a diet low in fruits and vegetables every year.&lt;ref name=WHOD/&gt;  Globally it is estimated to cause about 19% of [[gastrointestinal cancer]], 31% of [[ischaemic heart disease]], and 11% of [[strokes]],&lt;ref name=WHO123/&gt; thus making it one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747‚Äì57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular diets===
Popular diets, often referred to as [[fad diets]], make promises of weight loss or other health advantages such as longer life without backing by solid science, and in many cases are characterized by highly restrictive or unusual food choices.&lt;ref name=Nestle2006&gt;{{cite book|title=What to Eat|author=Nestle, Marion|year=2006|publisher=North Point Press (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|location=New York|isbn=978-0-86547-738-4|pages=611|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name=BU&gt;Jennifer Robbins, Silvina Pugliese, Diana Cullum-Dugan, Carine Lenders, Kathy Gorman Ireland [http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH/NutritionModules/Popular_Diets/Popular_Diets_print.html Popular Diets] Page accessed Jan 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;   Celebrity endorsements (including celebrity doctors) are frequently associated with popular diets, and the individuals who develop and promote these programs often profit handsomely.&lt;ref name="fitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fitzgerald M |title=Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US |year=2014 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=978-1-60598-560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11‚Äì12}}&lt;ref name=StJames&gt;Tina Gianoulis, "Dieting" in the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Ed.

Consumers are generally aware of the elements of a healthy diet, but find nutrition labels and diet advice in popular media confusing.&lt;ref name=Ridder2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Ridder |first1=D |last2=Kroese |first2=F |last3=Evers |first3=C |last4=Adriaanse |first4=M |last5=Gillebaart |first5=M |title=Healthy diet: Health impact, prevalence, correlates, and interventions. |journal=Psychology &amp; Health |date=August 2017 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=907‚Äì941 |doi=10.1080/08870446.2017.1316849 |pmid=28447854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears of high [[cholesterol]] were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s. However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and low-density [[lipoprotein]] ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol. For example, polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease both types of cholesterol; monounsaturated fats tend to lower LDL and raise HDL; saturated fats tend to either raise HDL, or raise both HDL and LDL;&lt;ref name=Mensink2003&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |vauthors=Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5  | pages = 1146‚Äì1155 |date=May 2003 | issn = 0002-9165|pmid=12716665| doi=10.1093/ajcn/77.5.1146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thijssen&gt;Thijssen, M.A. and R.P.

Dietary cholesterol is only found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy. The effect of dietary cholesterol on blood cholesterol levels is controversial. Some studies have found a link between cholesterol consumption and serum cholesterol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol: a meta-analysis and review.|journal= The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume= 55|issue= 6|pages= 1060‚Äì70|date= 22 March 2016|pmid=1534437|last1=Hopkins|first1=P.

[[Vending machine]]s in particular have come under fire as being avenues of entry into schools for [[junk food]] promoters. However, there is little in the way of regulation and it is difficult for most people to properly analyze the real merits of a company referring to itself as "healthy." Recently, the [[Committee of Advertising Practice]] in the United Kingdom launched a proposal to limit [[broadcast media|media]] advertising for food and soft drink products high in fat, salt or sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of public consultation on new food ad rules|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/News-reports/Media-Centre/2016/Launch-of-public-consultation-on-new-food-ad-rules.aspx|website=Committee of Advertising Practice|accessdate=16 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Heart Foundation]] released its own government-funded advertisements, labeled "Food4Thought", which were targeted at children and adults to discourage unhealthy habits of consuming [[junk food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bcs.com/pages/news_full.asp?NewsID=17678356 | title=British Heart Foundation launches Food4Thought campaign | publisher=British Cardiovascular Society | date=22 September 2006 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[psychology|psychological]] and [[culture|cultural]] perspective, a healthier diet may be difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/health/policy/25vegetables.html "Told to Eat Its Vegetables, America Orders Fries"] article by Kim Severson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 24, 2010, accessed September 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to tastes acquired in childhood and preferences for sugary, salty and/or fatty foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=James WP |journal=Obesity Research |issue=Mar;9 Suppl 1:6‚Äì13 |title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic |year=2008 |pmid=18307693 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x |volume=9 Suppl 1 |pages=6‚Äì13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Animals that are kept by humans also benefit from a healthy diet and the requirements of such diets may be very different from the ideal human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/dogs/diet|publisher=RSPCA|title=Heathlthy and Balanced Diet for Dogs|access-date=8 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hospital trust''', also known as an '''acute trust''' is an [[NHS trust]] that provides [[secondary care|secondary health services]] within the English [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] and, until they were abolished, in [[NHS Wales]]. Hospital trusts were commissioned to provide these services by [[NHS primary care trust]]s and now by [[clinical commissioning group]]s. NHS trusts were established by the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] as the first step in setting up an [[Quasi-market|internal market]].

[[NHS foundation trust]]s were regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] until 2016, when it was merged with the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]] to form [[NHS Improvement]]. As of January 2014, there were 59 NHS hospital trusts, out of the total of 97 NHS trusts supervised by the TDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntda.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/winter_report_web-FINAL.pdf |title=Winter Report |publisher=NHS Trust Development Authority |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carnation (brand)|Carnation]]-brand Instant Breakfast (now called Carnation Breakfast Essentials)was introduced in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h3hAR5c9QFcC&amp;pg=PA98 The 1960s - Edward J. Rielly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a powdered instant drink that is manufactured with protein, vitamins and minerals and sugar.&lt;ref name=Lantos/&gt; It is typically prepared with milk,&lt;ref name=Lantos/&gt; and is available in different flavors, such as chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&amp;pg=PA23 Breakfast: A History - Heather Arndt Anderson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Powdered forms are marketed in individual-serving packets and in cans. Carnation also manufactures prepared bottled instant breakfast drinks in liquid form.

==Frozen instant breakfasts==
Another type of instant breakfasts are [[Frozen food|frozen]] [[TV dinner|ready-made meals]] that are heated in a [[microwave oven]] or standard [[oven]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">'''Intercultural therapy''' is a form of [[psychotherapy]] aimed at benefiting [[culturally diverse]] groups. It recognises the importance of race, culture, beliefs, values, attitudes, religion and language in the life of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by Jafar Kareem in his book ''Intercultural Therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kareem (1992) believed that there are some intrinsic differences between individual human beings, either in their biology, their personality or both, and that both inter- and intrapsychic events profoundly affect an individual's psyche and develop as part of their unconscious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the external world, then, are real but they are also internalised. 

Intercultural therapy responds to the cultural variances identified by the field of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zanatta|first=Francesca|date=2008|title=Intercultural therapy and ethnopsychoanalysis: Are they both 'possession'?|journal=Opticon 1826|issue=4|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue4/Art_BMS_Zanatta_Ethnopsychoanalysis_Pub.pdf|doi=10.5334/opt.040810}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intercultural therapist must take the external realities of a client's life into account, such as poverty, refugee status, racism, sexism, physical health and physical abilities. Kareem believed that failure to understand cultural issues may lead to major diagnostic and therapeutic errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Intercultural therapy recognises the differences and similarities of various aspects of culture for both the client and therapist, and that the very fact of being from another culture involves both conscious and unconscious assumptions, both in the patient and in the therapist. These unconscious assumptions sometimes mean traditional modes of therapy do not address the needs of someone from outside a dominant culture, or that therapy is not offered to them in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Troche|first1=Ursula|title=Intercultural therapy|journal=The Independent Practitioner|date=2008|volume=Summer|page=2|url=http://bacppp.org.uk/_sitedata/1391515928%20Z3A0IvmuG/JournalsFromOldSite/2970_summer08.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isoinertial''' denotes a type of resistance used in [[exercise]] training which maintains a constant [[inertia]] throughout the [[range of motion]], facilitating a constant resistance and maximal muscle force in every angle.

The term ''isoinertial'' derives from the words iso (same) and inertial (resistance), which in one terminology describes the primary concept of the isoinertial system, or expressing the same inertia in both the [[Muscle contraction#Concentric contraction|concentric]] and the [[eccentric training|eccentric]] phases of [[muscle contraction]].

== The Origins ==
Since the late eighties, during long-duration [[Human spaceflight|space travel]], was placed as a problem as the ability to maintain power the muscles of [[astronauts]] engaged in missions, given that the absence of [[gravity]] led to an environment in which they operated [[ipotrofismo]] of the [[musculoskeletal system]], no longer called to support the load of the body weight, as well as a reduction in bone mineral density. Studies and research carried out about a solution that led to the strengthening of [[muscles]] of astronauts and subsequently, over the years, has become a method of muscle training very useful for preservation, prevention and rehabilitation. In practice it was created a system for [[Strength training|resistance training]] with a belt and a [[flywheel]] that, driven by the belt, controlling a process which generated movement regardless of the strength of gravity.

== The Isoinertial Method ==
The  isoinertial's muscle activity follows the muscular action of the sporting gesture or rather what the body or parts of it are in duty to perform in sports, according to which, in strength and speed variable, an [[inertial]] load (such as a ball), a limb or the body itself (such as when accelerating or changing direction) the athlete is forced to respond at the level coordinative motor and neuromuscular very quickly to situations and motor gestures sudden and not predetermined.

== The Benefits ==
The great utility of the isoinertial method and at the same time what makes it different from the normal isotonic muscle movement lies in the fact that the action isotonic developed in conventional exercises (strength machines and free weights), the resistance is constant throughout the whole of movement in both the concentric phase in which the eccentric, which is equivalent to the set load. In the isoinertial method the resistance is adapted in every moment and is proportional to the force developed in the sense that the greater the force expressed by the subject in the concentric phase, the greater will be the acceleration with which the flywheel reacts.

'''Jane Minor''' (abt 1792-1858), also known as Gensey (or Jensey&lt;ref&gt;Darlene Clark Hine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CZtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=black+women+in+white&amp;dq=black+women+in+white&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQzdWK4-fPAhUP0GMKHQ35C8QQ6AEIHDAA ''Black Women in White]'',  Indiana University Press 1989&lt;/ref&gt;) Snow,  was an African-American [[Traditional medicine|healer]] and slave [[Emancipation|emancipator]], one of the few documented enslaved healing practitioners in United States history.

==Early life==

Minor was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as Gensey Snow in [[Dinwiddie County]], [[Virginia]]. She worked on the estate of Benjamin Harris May.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Hawkins Adams. "[http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_5328088c-6b14-11e2-811f-001a4bcf6878.html Jane Minor]", Richmond Times Dispatch, February 23, 1999, D-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healer and emancipator==

Minor "was apparently skilled medically and a very gifted, nurturing healer, someone patients really responded to,"  according to historian Susan Lebsock.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Richmond Times Dispatch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Lebsock, "[http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-inside.aspx?ID=11135&amp;CTYPE=G The Free Women of Petersburg: Status and Culture in a Southern Town], 1784-1860,  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1825, a fever [[epidemic]] struck [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], Virginia,  and many families,  black and white, were affected. As a result of her healing work, Benjamin May gave Minor her freedom. In the [[manumission]] deed, he notes that he freed Minor "for several acts of extraordinary merit in nursing at the imminent risk of her own health and safety, exercising the most unexampled patience and attention in watching over the sick beds of several individuals of this town, as well as on account of my belief that she will in the future continue ... to perform similar acts ... "&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Richmond-Times Dispatch&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, she met and married Lewis Minor, a free laborer. After her emancipation, she took the name Jane Minor.  The money Jane Minor earned as a medical practitioner, usually from $2-$5 per visit, allowed her to purchase and free at least sixteen slaves, some of whom cost over $2,000. In one case, in July, 1840, she bought and freed a [[mulatto]] woman named Emily Smith and her five children. In another, the same month and year,  she emancipated a fellow healing practitioner named Phoebe Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Claude A. Green, [https://books.google.com/books/about/What_We_Dragged_Out_of_Slavery_with_Us.html?id=FK8YdrwXz6sC What We Dragged Out of Slavery with Us],  Infinity Publishing, 2006, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Godwin Woodson, Rayford Whittingham Logan, The Journal of Negro History, 1930 Volume 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luther Porter Jackson, Free Negro Labor and Property Holding in Virginia Appleton Century Company, New York 1942&lt;/ref&gt;  Lebsock says Minor was the most active free black emancipator in Petersburg, male or female.&lt;ref&gt;Lebsock, p. 96-111&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 30 years after her manumission, Petersburg newspapers printed reports of operations performed by physicians in "the Hospital of the well-known nurse Jinsey Snow."&lt;ref&gt;Todd L. Savitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ru_tDLLB0wMC&amp;dq=%22jane+minor%22+%22nurse%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Medicine and Slavery], University of Illinois Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cupping therapy|Cupping]] and [[Leeching (medical)|leeching]] were standard medical practices of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalyn Fraad Baxandall, Linda Gordon, Susan Reverb, [https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Working-Women-Documentary-Publications/dp/0393312623 America's Working Women: A Documentary History, 1600 to the Present],  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1995, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have observed that enslaved medical practitioners like Jane Minor often brought herbal and other medical knowledge from [[Africa]] that was at that time unknown in early colonial America.&lt;ref&gt;Mwalimu J. Shujaa, Kenya J. Shujaa,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ooVNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA578&amp;lpg=PA578&amp;dq=mwalimu+sage+encyclopedia+jane++minor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tf0TeqQplf&amp;sig=d6gAgDb1wGL5OeRi_RMN8gu3deM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN8J6d_9bKAhUBTGMKHeg_DxwQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=mwalimu%20sage%20encyclopedia%20jane%20%20minor&amp;f=false The SAGE Encyclopedia of African Cultural Heritage in North America], p. 578, SAGE Publications, Feb 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as ''Kpete'', '''Kwete''' is the [[alcoholic beverage]] brewed particularly by the [[Lugbara people]] of [[Uganda]] and [[DR Congo]]. The production process involves mixing fermented [[sorghum]], [[millet]] or [[maize]], [[malt]], boiled [[water]] and [[yeast]] which is locally called ''Aku fi''. 

In [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile]] markets, this traditional [[beer]] is usually sold and consumed in a [[calabash]] (locally called ''Icereke'') but can also be bought in any container.

==Other producers==
Kwete is also produced in [[Kampala]] and the rest of Uganda. Top quality Kwete is creamish to light brown in colour, with a thick consistent sweet-sour taste. Production involves millet grains being soaked for 24 - 48 hours. Then, they are germinated for 48 - 72 hours and sun dried for about 48 hours before souring in a container sealed at the top. Next, [[roasting]] of [[sourdough]] is done on a large rectangular metallic tray before [[mashing]] and [[fermentation]]. Finally, [[Filtration|filtering]] with a special [[cloth]] is done for a smooth tasting uniform-coloured drink.

The [[Pojulu people]] of [[South Sudan]] also sell an [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] by the same name and so do the [[Bukusu tribe]] of Kenya.

== Autoimmune diseases qualifiers ==
Overview of the qualifiers for the list. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|colspan=2 style="background:lightblue" | Other Qualifiers
|-
|A || "Accepted" in prior version of this table
|-
|C || A disease, regarded as autoimmune, that is often found in individuals with another autoimmune condition. This designation is given to diseases that are classified by Rose and Bona as having "circumstantial" evidence of autoimmune etiology. Diseases in this list with a "C" are, therefore, actual autoimmune diseases, rather than comorbid symptoms, which appear [[#Autoimmune Comorbidities|after this list]]. 
|-
|E || Disease is an autoimmune response triggered by a specific environmental factor  
|-
|F || Disease is only caused by autoimmunity in only a fraction of those who suffer from it 
|-
|I || Described as an autoinflammatory disease  
|-
|L || Evidence to indicate autoimmunity is extremely limited or circumstantial 
|-
|M || Disease appears under Autoimmune Diseases in MeSH
|-
|N || Not listed in prior version of this table
|-
|R || Disease appeared in prior version but has been renamed. In renaming, precedence has been given to scientific names over those based on discoverers. 
|-
|S || "Suspected" in the prior version of this table
|-
|T || Disease has a known trigger, such as viral infection, vaccination, or injury 
|-
|X || An extremely rare disease, which would suggest limited opportunity to study it and conclusively determine whether it is caused by autoimmunity
|-
|Y || Listed in the prior version of this table with "Accepted/Suspected" left blank

# The disease is included in several widely used lists of autoimmune disease and is shown here to ensure that a person visiting this page does not conclude that the disease was not considered. Before moving a condition from here to the list of autoimmune diseases, references should be provided in the Wikipedia page for the condition that point to evidence, direct or indirect, that it is an autoimmune disease.

'''MRC Human Nutrition Research''' is the largest [[research institute]] in the UK for human nutrition, and is based in [[Cambridge]].

==History==
In 1998 MRC Human Nutrition Research (HNR) was formed as a result of the restructuring of the [[Dunn Human Nutrition Unit]] following the resignation of Professor Roger Whitehead.&lt;ref name=HNR&gt;http://www.mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), founded in 1913, had previously had a Human Nutrition Research Unit at the end of the [[Second World War]]; this was founded and directed by BS Platt, and was interested in serious nutritional deficiencies in children, that would cause significantly premature death. HNR was formed in order to continue to advance the MRC's portfolio of strategic and applied nutrition research.

==Mission==
The mission of HNR is to conduct nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on [[obesity]] and metabolic risk, [[musculoskeletal]] health, [[intestinal]] health and [[nutritional]] inequalities.&lt;ref name=HNR/&gt;

==Objectives==
HNR currently states that its 4 objectives&lt;ref name=HNR/&gt; are to: 
*Advance knowledge through discovery science, the development of innovative methodologies and the application of specialist expertise in priority areas
*Improve health and economic advantage through the exchange of knowledge and technology to inform nutrition policy and practice
*Provide opportunities for training and to build capacity for nutrition research
*Foster a dialogue with the public on nutrition science and its implications for health

==Structure==
HNR is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/644523 based] at Peterhouse Technology Park, in south-east Cambridge, on the [[South Cambridgeshire]]-Cambridge boundary, round the corner from the Fulbourn - Cherry Hinton [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/44579 Tesco] and [[Fulbourn Hospital]]. [[ARM Holdings]] have their [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/609459 headquarters] on the same site.

It is divided into 3 main research departments and a support department:
* Cellular and Molecular Sciences
* Nutritional Physiology &amp; Biomarkers
* Diet and Population Health
* Scientific Operations &amp; Logistics

These departments house research groups concerned with:
* Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition
* National Nutrition Surveys
* Nutrition &amp; Bone Health
* Nutritional Interventions
* Obesity &amp; Related Metabolic Disorders
* Nutrition Communications and Translation into Policy &amp; Practice
* Nutrition Epidemiology
* Biomineral Research
* Lipid Profiling and Signalling
* Physiological Modelling of Metabolic Risk
* Dietary Assessment

HNR also has a library which houses an important collection of historically significant research documents.

==Function==
HNR conducts nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on obesity and metabolic risk, musculoskeletal health, intestinal health and nutritional inequalities.

===Research===
In November 1999 HNR scientists discovered that children in the early 1950s, despite [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], had healthier diets than children today. They had a greater intake of calcium, from drinking more milk, and of iron, as they ate more red meat than poultry and iron containing dark green vegetables such as [[broccoli]] and [[kale]]. In the early 1950s, no children would have eaten pasta, but 50% of children in the 1990s did. However children in the 1950s were faced with more incurable illnesses, prevented today by [[Vaccination schedule#United Kingdom|vaccination]].

In September 2002, HNR scientists proved a link between [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] and being overweight. They found that people who had lost 9&amp;nbsp;lb in weight had reduced the chances of having diabetes by 58%.

In 2007, a study was conducted to research the effect of negative weight stigmas on patients. The conclusion was that in several cases, the belief in the negative weight stigmas led to overeating and bad health habits in patients who were studies. More details can be found in the official report listed under references.

HNR participated in the [[National Diet and Nutrition Survey]] and the MRC's [[National Survey of Health and Development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nshd.mrc.ac.uk NSHD]&lt;/ref&gt; which showed insights such as approximately five per cent of the UK's population are vegetarian.

'''Maitri Pune''' is a volunteer [[non-governmental organisation]] based in [[Pune]], India whose work includes helping [[tribals]] in the [[Melghat]] and [[Marathwada]] regions. They have helped to lower the infant mortality rate, along with raising agricultural production and increasing AIDS awareness. In recent years they have expanded their reach to include natural disaster relief and a helpline for AIDS awareness which was receiving 1,500 calls a day as of 2009.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-05-19/pune/28175518_1_melghat-region-aids-awareness-engineering-student|title=With Maitri, weekends get a new meaning|last=Anand|first=Shambhavi|author2=Samarpita Banerjee|date=2009-05-19|work=Times of India|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=196533|title=Appeal for Aid|date=08-12-2006|work=Express India|accessdate=15 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111164503/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=196533#|archive-date=11 November 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesocarb was sold in [[Russia]] as 5 milligram tablets under the brand name '''Sydnocarb'''. Hydroxylated metabolites can be detected in urine for up to 10 days after consumption.&lt;ref name="pmid15808002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shpak AV, Appolonova SA, Semenov VA | title = Validation of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry method for the determination of mesocarb in human plasma and urine | journal = J Chromatogr Sci | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 11‚Äì21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15808002 | doi = 10.1093/chromsci/43.1.11| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug is almost unknown in the western world and is neither used in medicine or studied scientifically to any great extent outside Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union. It has however been added to the list of drugs under international control and is illegal in most countries, despite its multiple therapeutic applications and reported lack of significant [[abuse potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudenko GM, Altshuler RA |title=[Experimental and clinical study of Sydnocarb] |language=Russian |journal=Hung Pharmacotherapy |volume=124 |issue= |pages=150‚Äì4 |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, with the advent of mass spectroscopy, it has been shown that presence of amphetamine in prior studies was an artifact of gas chromatography method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appolonova|first=Svetlana S.|last2=Shpak|first2=Alexey V.|last3=Semenov|first3=Vitaliy|date=2004|title=Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry for analysis of mesocarp and its metabolites in human urine|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|volume=800|issue=|pages=281‚Äì289|pmid=14698267|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2003.10.071}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using mass spectroscopy show that negligible levels of amphetamine are released from mesocarp metabolism.&lt;ref name="pmid15808002" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Mesocarb is a [[mesoionic]] [[sydnone imine]]. It has the amphetamine-backbone present, except that the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; has a complicated imine side-chain present.

The '''Minar''' ({{lang-fa|ŸÖŸÜÿßÿ±}}, literally "pillar") or '''Minaret''' ({{lang|fa|ŸÖŸÜÿßÿ±Ÿá|rtl=yes}}), mentioned in medieval [[Arabic]]-language Islamic sources as '''Terbal''' ({{lang|ar|ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÑ|rtl=yes}} ''·π¨irbƒÅl''), was a unique, spiral, tower-like structure built in the centre of the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] circular city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|G≈çr]] (modern Firuzabad, Iran). Several theories have been proposed for its purpose. Only the core of the structure remains today.

== Description and history ==
[[Ardashir I]]'s new city of Gor had a [[circular plan]] with the official buildings located at the centre of an inner circle {{convert|450|m}} in radius. The tower-like structure of Terbal was located at the very centre of this circle. Together with [[Takht-e Neshin]], these are the only structures of the city that are made of granite-mortar-masonry. According to ''[[Iranica]]'', these two structures may have been confused in medieval Islamic sources, and it is unclear that the names ''AywƒÅn kiyƒÅkhurra'' ({{lang|fa|ÿß€åŸàÿßŸÜ ⁄©€åÿßÿÆŸàÿ±Ÿá|rtl=yes}}) ([[Istakhri]]), ''Gunbad-i Kƒ´rmƒÅn'' (or ''Gƒ´rmƒÅn''; {{lang|fa|⁄ØŸÜÿ®ÿØ ⁄Ø€åÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜ|rtl=yes}}) and ''ƒ™rƒÅn Garda/Girda''&lt;ref name="Strange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strange|first1=Guy Le|author-link=Guy Le Strange|editor1-last=Kennedy|editor1-first=Hugh|title=Collected works of Guy Le Strange: the medieval Islamic world|date=2014|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=9781848856707|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|fa|ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ⁄Øÿ±ÿØŸá|rtl=yes}}) ([[Ibn al-Balkhi]]) mentioned in these sources refer to which structure. Terbal was a {{convert|9|m}} square structure with more than {{convert|30|m}} high and spiral in design.

== Purpose ==
[[File:Media, Babylon and Persia - including a study of the Zend-Avesta or religion of Zoroaster, from the fall of Nineveh to the Persian war (1889) (14594614317).jpg|thumb|left|160px|An 1889 artistic impression of the Minar as a [[fire temple]], with the outer stairs reconstructed and the Holy Fire (''[[atar]]'') at its top]]

Among Western orientalists and travellers, the structure was first observed by [[Eug√®ne Flandin]] and [[Pascal Coste]], who noted its uniqueness in [[Iranian architecture]]. Prior to [[Ernst Herzfeld]] studies of the structure, Terbal was mistakenly thought to be a descendant of the [[ziggurat]], while some thought it is a [[fire temple]], with the Holy Fire (''[[atar]]'') being put at its top to avoid contamination with dust.&lt;ref name=firuzabad /&gt;&lt;ref name=keyhan&gt;{{lang|fa| ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿà€åÿå ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØÿõ [http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/935/27/text ¬´ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÑ ÿ™ÿØÿßŸàŸÖ ŸÖÿπŸÖÿßÿ±€å ÿ≤€å⁄ØŸàÿ±ÿßÿ™¬ª], ⁄©€åŸáÿßŸÜ ŸÅÿ±ŸáŸÜ⁄Ø€å, ÿØ€å 1367, ÿ¥ŸÖÿßÿ±Ÿá 58, ÿµÿµ 26‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mehrafarin /&gt;

It is hypothesised that the structure may have been part of a government building and symbolised the [[List of shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire|divine and centralist kingship]] introduced by Ardashir I. It may have had practical military and civil uses as well, as the tower provided visual contact with some fortifications in the area, and/or may have been used as an [[observation tower]] to survey activities during the implementation of the planned scheme of the new city of Gor and the plain. In fact, this grand scheme was centred in Terbal and continued the concentric and radiant pattern of the town, with traces of canals, paths, walls and field borders found up to 10&amp;nbsp;km distance from this central tower.&lt;ref name="firuzabad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huff|first1=Dietrich|title=Fƒ™R≈™ZƒÄBƒÄD|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/firuzabad|website=[[Encyclop√¶dia Iranica]]|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=15 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newer study, the structure, as also described in medieval sources, may have functioned as a [[water tower]], in such a way that water from nearby elevated sources would flow through tubes and Terbal's hollow core towards its dome, and from there it would be flowed to another tube to flow elsewhere in the town. It is argued that it was not the only purpose of the structure, but it was also part of a [[Temple of Anahita|temple]] dedicated to [[Anahita]], the divinity of the Waters (''[[Aban]]'').&lt;ref name="mehrafarin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strange" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¢ŸÅÿ±ŸäŸÜ ÿ±ÿ∂ÿßÿå ÿÆÿ±ÿßÿ¥ÿßÿØŸä ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ±ÿå ÿ¨ÿßŸÖŸá ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Ø ÿπÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿå [http://fa.journals.sid.ir/ViewPaper.aspx?id=229151 ¬´ÿßÿ±ÿØÿ¥Ÿäÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±Ÿá: ÿ™ÿÆÿ™⁄ØÿßŸá ÿßÿ±ÿØÿ¥Ÿäÿ± ŸæÿßŸæ⁄©ÿßŸÜ¬ª]ÿå ''ŸæŸäÿßŸÖ ÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿ≥'': ÿ®Ÿáÿßÿ± Ÿà ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ 1392ÿå ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá 9ÿå ÿ¥ŸÖÿßÿ±Ÿá 19ÿå ÿµÿµ 107‚Äì120.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the Terbal was the architectural predecessor of the unique [[minaret]] of [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (also known as the ''malwiya'') in [[Iraq]], which was built in the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period.&lt;ref name="rch.ac.ir"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ÿßÿ±ÿ¨ÿ≠|first1=ÿß⁄©ÿ±ŸÖ|title=ÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπ ⁄©ÿ®€åÿ±|url=http://rch.ac.ir/article/Details?id=10224|website=rch.ac.ir|publisher=ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿ¨ŸáÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ|accessdate=21 May 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minaret itself inspired that of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo,&lt;ref name="rch.ac.ir" /&gt; and recently [[Philip Johnson]]'s design for the 1976 Chapel of Thanksgiving at [[Thanks-Giving Square]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanksgiving.org/thanks-giving-square/visit/tour/|title=Self-Guided Tour ‚Äì Guide to Thanks-Giving Square|website=www.thanksgiving.org|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Tips: Thanks-Giving Chapel's Islamic Design a Visual, Spiritual Gem in Downtown Dallas|url=http://www.washingtonreport.me/2010-november/travel-tips-thanks-giving-chapel-s-islamic-design-a-visual-spiritual-gem-in-downtown-dallas.html|website=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|accessdate=21 May 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulze|first1=Franz|title=Philip Johnson: Life and Work|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226740584|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monoplegia''' is [[paralysis]] of a single [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]], usually an arm. Common symptoms associated with monoplegic patients are weakness, numbness, and pain in the affected limb. Monoplegia is a type of paralysis that falls under [[hemiplegia]]. While hemiplegia is paralysis of half of the body, monoplegia is localized to a single limb or to a specific region of the body. Monoplegia of the upper limb is sometimes referred to as brachial monoplegia, and that of the lower limb is called crural monoplegia. Monoplegia in the lower extremities is not as common of an occurrence as in the upper extremities. Monoparesis is a similar, but less severe, condition because one limb is very weak, not paralyzed. For more information, see [[paresis]].   

Many conditions that cause [[paraplegia]] or [[quadriplegia]] begin as monoplegia. Thus, the diagnosis of spinal [[paraplegia]] must also be consulted. In addition, multiple cerebral disorders that cause [[hemiplegia]] may begin as monoplegia&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Pediatric Neurology: a signs and symptoms approach|last=Fenichel|first=Gerald|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Monoplegia is also frequently associated with, and considered to be the mildest form of, [[cerebral palsy]]. 

==Signs and symptoms==

There are a number of symptoms associated with monoplegia. Curling of the hands or stiffness of the feet, weakness, [[spasticity]], numbness, paralysis, pain in the affected limb, headaches, and shoulder pain are all considered to be symptoms of monoplegia. Patients of monoplegia typically feel symptoms of weakness and loss of sensation in the affected extremity, usually an arm. Despite these symptoms, the extremity with paralysis continues to maintain a strong pulse.   

While chronic progressive brachial monoplegia is uncommon, [[syringomyelia]] and tumors of the cervical cord or [[brachial plexus]] may be the cause. The onset of brachial plexus paralysis is usually explosive where pain is the initial feature. Pain localizes to the shoulder but may be more diffuse, or could be limited to the lower arm. Pain is severe and often described as sharp, stabbing, throbbing, or aching. The duration of pain, which is constant, varies from a span of several hours to 3 weeks&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Pediatric Neurology: a signs and symptoms approach|last=Fenichel|first=Gerald|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As the pain subsides, weakness usually appears. In addition, chronicle progressive weakness of one leg suggests a tumor of the spinal cord of the [[lumbar plexus]]. Fever is often the first symptom of lumbar plexus paralysis, followed by pain in one or both legs. The pain has an abrupt onset and may occur in a [[femoral nerve|femoral]] or [[Sciatic nerve|sciatic]] distribution. Weakness may develop concurrently with pain or be delayed for as long as 3 weeks&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Furthermore, a monomeric form of [[spinal muscular atrophy]], affecting only one leg or arm, should be considered when progressive weakness is not accompanied by sensory loss&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  

==Causes==

Some potential causes of monoplegia are listed below.

Specifically, monoplegia in the lower extremities is typically caused by [[Brown-S√©quard syndrome|Brown Sequard]] syndrome and hematomas in the frontoparietal cortex near the middle that could produce a deficit such as this, but this is a very uncommon occurrence.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Human_motor_cortex.jpg|thumb|Human motor cortex]]
[[File:Gray764.png|thumb|The motor tract.]]
In monoplegia, the spine and the proximal portion of nerves are usually the abnormal sites of limb weakness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Monoplegia resulting from upper extremity impairments following a stroke occurs due to direct damage to the [[primary motor cortex]], [[Primary somatosensory cortex|primary somatosensory cortex,]] secondary [[sensorimotor cortex]], [[Cortical area|sensorimotor cortical areas]], [[subcortical]] structures, and/or the [[corticospinal tract]].&lt;ref name="Lang_2013" /&gt; It is often found that impairments following stroke are either caused by damage to the same or adjacent neurological structures.&lt;ref name="Lang_2013" /&gt; A combination of these impairments is more likely than just one in isolation.&lt;ref name="Lang_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lang CE, Bland MD, Bailey RR, Schaefer SY, Birkenmeier RL | title = Assessment of upper extremity impairment, function, and activity after stroke: foundations for clinical decision making | journal = Journal of Hand Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 104‚Äì14;quiz 115 | date = 2013 | pmid = 22975740 | pmc = 3524381 | doi = 10.1016/j.jht.2012.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to the [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal]] system results in an inability to activate muscles with enough force or in a coordinated manner, which can lead to paresis, loss of fractional movement, and abnormal muscle tone.&lt;ref name="Lang_2013" /&gt; Damage to the somatosensory cortical areas causes loss of [[somatosensation]] which results in an impaired ability to monitor movement.&lt;ref name="Lang_2013" /&gt;

Considering monoplegia as it relates to cerebral palsy, in premature infants, the most common cause of cerebral palsy is [[Ventricular system|periventricular]] [[hemorrhagic]] [[infarction]]. In term infants, the underlying causes are often cerebral malformations, cerebral [[Infarction|infarction,]] and [[intracerebral hemorrhage]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Delayed crawling or walking are the usual concerns that arise in infants with paralysis of the limb. In these cases, abnormalities of the legs are the main focus of the attention&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Diagnosis==

Monoplegia is diagnosed by a physician after a physical examination and sometimes after further neurologic examination as well. As monoplegia is fairly rare, after physical examination of a patient complaining of monoplegia, sometimes weakness of an additional limb is also identified and the patient is diagnosed with [[hemiplegia]] or [[paraplegia]] instead. &lt;ref name="Vasconcelos_2017" /&gt; After neurologic examination of the limb, a diagnosis of a monoplegic limb can be given if the patient receives a Medical Research Council power grade of 0, which is a measurement of the patient's limb strength.&lt;ref name="Deftereos_2008" /&gt;  [[Needle electromyography|Needle Electromyography]] is often used to study all limbs, essentially showing the extent in each limb involvement. Furthermore, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is the diagnostic modality of choice for investigating all forms of hemiplegia. It is especially informative to show migrational defects in hemiplegic cerebral palsy associated with seizures&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical pediatric neurology: A signs and symptoms approach.|last=Fenichel|first=Gerald|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

An approach called single-pulse [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (spTMS) has also been used to help diagnose motor deficits such as monoplegia.&lt;ref name="Deftereos_2008" /&gt; This is done by evaluating the functional level of the corticospinal tract through stimulation of the corticospinal lesions in order to obtain neurophysiologic evidence on the integrity of the corticospinal tracts.&lt;ref name="Deftereos_2008" /&gt; Single-pulse [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] provides [[neuropsychological]] feedback such as [[Motor evoked potentials|motor-evoked potentials]] (MEPs) and central motor conduction time (CMCT).&lt;ref name="Deftereos_2008" /&gt; This feedback can then be compared to the normal limits of patients who do not show evidence of deficits in the corticospinal tracts.&lt;ref name="Deftereos_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deftereos SN, Panagopoulos GN, Georgonikou DD, Karageorgiou EC, Kefalou PN, Karageorgiou CE | title = Diagnosis of nonorganic monoplegia with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 414 | date = 2008 | pmid = 19158985 | pmc = 2629052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Treatment==

There is no cure for monoplegia, but treatments typically include physical therapy and counseling to help recover muscle tone and function.  Recovery will vary depending on diagnosis of temporary, partial or complete paralysis. Much of the therapies focus on the upper limb due to the fact that monoplegia in the upper limbs is much more common than in the lower limbs. It has been found that intense activity-based and goal-directed therapy, such as [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] and bimanual therapy, are more effective than standard care. Studies suggest the less affected hand could provide a template for improving motor performance of the more affected hand, and provides a strong rationale for the development of bimanual training approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Precision grip control, sensory impairments and their interactions in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy: A systematic review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422213002473|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|language=en|volume=34|issue=9|pages=3014‚Äì3028|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2013.05.047|issn=0891-4222}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to that, there is strong evidence to support that occupational therapy home programs that are goal-directed could be used to supplement hands-on direct therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakzewski L, Ziviani J, Boyd RN | title = Efficacy of upper limb therapies for unilateral cerebral palsy: a meta-analysis | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = e175-204 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24366991 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2013-0675 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/1/e175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is specifically targeted at upper limb monoplegia as a result of a stroke. In CIMT the unaffected arm is restrained, forcing the use and frequent practice of the affected arm. This approach to therapy is carried out during ordinary and daily activities by the affected person. It has been found that CIMT is more effective at specifically improving arm movement than a [[physiotherapy]] approach or no treatment at all.&lt;ref name="Corbetta_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbetta D, Sirtori V, Castellini G, Moja L, Gatti R | title = Constraint-induced movement therapy for upper extremities in people with stroke | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD004433 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26446577 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004433.pub3 | url = https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/330580/2/CorbettaMoja_TheCochraneLibrary_ConstraintInduced_2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that this type of therapy has proved to provide an only moderate improvement in patients with monoplegia.&lt;ref name="Corbetta_2015" /&gt; More research needs to be conducted in order to establish the lasting benefit of constraint-induced movement therapy.

[[Brain‚Äìcomputer interface|Brain computer interface]] (BCI) systems have been proposed as a tool for rehabilitation of monoplegia, specifically in the upper limb after a stroke.&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017" /&gt; BCI systems provide sensory feedback in the brain via functional electrical stimulation, [[virtual reality]] environments, or robotic systems, which allows for the use of brain signals.&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017" /&gt;This is extremely crucial because the networking in the brain is often compromised after a stroke, leading to impaired movement or paralysis. BCI systems allow for detection of intention to move through the primary motor cortex, then provide the matched [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimulation]] according to feedback that is provided.&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017" /&gt; This leads to [[Activity-dependent plasticity|activity-dependent plasticit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y within the user, requiring them to pay careful attention to tasks that require the activation or deactivation of specific brain areas.&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017" /&gt; BCI systems utilize different sources of information for feedback, including [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[magnetoencephalography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[near-infrared spectroscopy]], or [[electrocorticography]].&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017" /&gt; Among all of these, the EEG signals are the most useful for this type of rehabilitation because they are highly accurate and stable.&lt;ref name="Monge-Pereira_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monge-Pereira E, Iba√±ez-Pereda J, Alguacil-Diego IM, Serrano JI, Spottorno-Rubio MP, Molina-Rueda F | title = Use of Electroencephalography Brain-Computer Interface Systems as a Rehabilitative Approach for Upper Limb Function After a Stroke: A Systematic Review | language = English | journal = Pm &amp; R | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 918‚Äì932 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28512066 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.04.016 | url = http://www.pmrjournal.org/article/S1934-1482(17)30581-6/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of treatment for monoplegia is [[functional electrical stimulation]] (FES). It is targeted at patients who acquired monoplegia through incidents such as a [[spinal cord injury]], stroke, [[multiple sclerosis]], or cerebral palsy and utilizes electrical stimulation in order to cause the remaining motor units in the paralyzed muscles to contract.&lt;ref name="Ethier_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ethier C, Miller LE | title = Brain-controlled muscle stimulation for the restoration of motor function | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 83 | pages = 180‚Äì90 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 25447224 | pmc = 4412757 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2014.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in traditional muscular training, FES improves the force with which the unaffected muscles contract. For less severely affected patients, FES allows for greater improvement in range of motion than traditional physical therapy.&lt;ref name="Ethier_2015" /&gt;

'''Multifocal stenosing ulceration of the small intestine''' is a rare condition that is characterised by recurrent ulcers of the small intestine.

==Presentation==

The clinical features of this condition are variable. Features associated with it include: 

*Abdominal pain
*Abdominal distension
*Fatigue
*Weight loss
*Fever
*Malaise
*Joint symptoms

Faecal occult blood testing is usually positive. 

Laboratory investigations normally show [[anaemia]] and low [[albumin]].

==Aetiology==

A mutation in the cytosolic phospholipase A2-Œ± gene ([[PLA2G4A]]) has been identified as the cause of this disease in one family.&lt;ref name=Brooke2012&gt;Brooke MA, Longhurst HJ, Plagnol V, Kirkby NS, Mitchell JA, R√ºschendorf F, Warner TD, Kelsell DP, Macdonald TT (2012) Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteritis associated with homozygous deletion mutations in cytosolic phospholipase A2-Œ±. Gut&lt;/ref&gt; In this family the mutation was inherited as an autosomal recessive. It is not yet known if this gene is the cause of this disease in other families.

The gene encoding cytosolic phospholipase A2-Œ± is found on [[chromosome 1]]. Cytosolic phospholipase A2-Œ± acts on membrane phospholipids to release [[arachidonic acid]] a precursor in the synthesis of [[eicosanoid]]s. The eicosanoids are involved in multiple regulatory pathways.

==Pathology==

This disease is characterised by multifocal stenosing ulceration of the small intestine. The ulcers are circular or irregular in shape and their margins are always clear. The intervening mucosa appears normal. The lesions involve only the [[mucosa]] and [[submucosa]] and are confined to the [[jejunum]] and proximal [[ileum]]. Nonspecific inflammatory changes are present. [[Giant cell]]s or other typical features of granulomatous inflammation are not found. Multiple stenoses are typically present (mean 8: range 1-25).

==Diagnosis==

This may be difficult given the non specific nature of the presenting symptoms and the rarity of the condition itself. It is normally made by the combination of the clinical picture, endoscopic findings and typical histology. Radiology may also be helpful. Other conditions such as infections and vasculitis should be ruled out with the relevant laboratory investigations.

===Differential diagnosis===

*[[Idiopathic ulcerative jejunoileitis]]
*[[Lymphoma]]
*Infectious agents (''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'' and others)
*Infections in the immunosuppressed with unusual organisms
*''[[Tropheryma whipplei]], [[Mycobacterium avium intracellulare]]''
*Drug induced (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, [[gold]], [[potassium]], [[chemotherapy]])
*[[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]]
*[[Heterotopic functioning gastric mucosa]]
*[[Meckel's diverticulum]]
*[[Crohn's disease]]
*Traumatic injury (surgical, seat belt injury, endoscopic biopsy, cautery during endoscopy, foreign body ingestion particularly [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]])
*[[Ischemia]]
*[[Thrombotic disease]]s
*[[Degos disease]]
*[[Pseudoxanthoma elasticum]]
*[[Myeloproliferative disorders]]
*[[Antithrombin III deficiency]]
*[[Vasculitis]]
*[[Coeliac disease]]
*[[Behcet's disease]]

==Treatment==

Steroids seem to relieve the symptoms but long term treatment may be required.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman HJ (2009) Multifocal stenosing ulceration of the small intestine. World J Gastroenterol 15(39): 4883‚Äì4885&lt;/ref&gt; Other immunosuppressants appear to be less effective. Surgery may be curative in ~40% but a second operation may be required later.

==Prognosis==

This condition may be lifelong. Although not normally fatal it may necessiate admission to hospital for transfusions, control of bleeding or other complications. Because of its rarity to date there have been no controlled trials. Treatment remains empirical and symptomatic.
==History==

This disease was first recognised in 1959.&lt;ref name=Rocha1959&gt;Rocha A, Artigas V (1959) Stenosing ulcerous disease of the jejuno-ileum. Arch Mal Appar Dig Mal Nutr 48:1230‚Äì1236&lt;/ref&gt; It was redescribed and named 'cryptogenetic plurifocal ulcerative stenosing enteritis' in 1964.&lt;ref name=Debray1964&gt;Debray C, Besancon F, Hardouin JP, Martin E, Marche C, Khoury K (1964) Cryptogenetic plurifocal ulcerative stenosing enteritis. Arch Mal Appar Dig Mal Nutr. 1964;53:193‚Äì206&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3207">'''Nursing research''' is research that provides evidence used to support [[nursing practice]]s. Nursing, as an evidence-based area of practice, has been developing since the time of [[Florence Nightingale]] to the present day, where many nurses now work as researchers based in [[universities]] as well as in the [[health care]] setting.

[[Nurse education]] places focus upon the use of [[evidence]] from [[research]] in order to rationalise nursing [[Nursing Interventions Classification|interventions]]. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], courts may determine if a nurse acted [[reasonable|reasonably]] based upon whether their intervention was supported by [[research]].

Nursing research falls largely into two areas:

* [[Quantitative research]] is based in the [[paradigm]] of [[logical positivism]] and is focused upon outcomes for clients that are measurable, generally using [[statistics]]. The dominant [[research methods|research method]] is the [[randomised controlled trial]].
* [[Qualitative research]] is based in the paradigm of [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[grounded theory]], ethnography and others, and examines the experience of those receiving or delivering the nursing care, focusing, in particular, on the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] that it holds for the individual. The research methods most commonly used are [[interviews]], [[case studies]], [[focus group]]s and [[ethnography]]

Recently in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[action research]] has become increasingly popular in nursing.

==Evidence-based quality improvement practices==
In 2008, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [[AHRQ]] created the [[AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange]] to document and share health care quality improvement programs, including hundreds of profiles featuring nursing innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Belinda |last = Ireland |url=http://theevidencedoc.com/news/2013/4/2/free-resources-for-quality-improvement-from-ahrq-innovations-exchange-improve-the-quality-of-your-qi |title=Free Resources for Quality Improvement from AHRQ Innovations Exchange - Improve the Quality of Your QI |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the nursing profiles contained in this collection contains an evidence rating that assesses how strong the relationship is between the innovative practice and the results described in the profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/help/evidence-rating |title=What Is the Evidence Rating? |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric and mental health nurses treat individuals diagnosed with conditions like schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and depression. They are also trained in behavioral therapy which allows these nurses to teach patients and their loved ones how to deal with, react to, and overcome challenges that go along with different psychiatric disorders. Nurses in the psychiatric and mental health field can assess, examine, and treat patients with mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovernursing.com/specialty/psychiatric-nurse#.WCIATS0rKUk|title=Psychiatric Nurse|website=DiscoverNursing.com {{!}} Campaign for Nursing|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses with proper training are able to identify and understand the needs and help-seeking behaviors of military members and, with military cultural competence and knowledge about stress injuries, including psychological damage, they are able to deliver patient-centered care to patients with military culture experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Vol-20-2015/No1-Jan-2015/Military-Culture-Implications.html|title=Military Culture Implications for Mental Health and Nursing Care|website=www.nursingworld.org|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training ===

==== Active duty ====
In the U.S. Army, the case diversity nurses experience in caring for Soldiers and their families far exceeds the medical care environment of the private sector. Army Nurse Corps officers have access to the most sophisticated and up-to-date technology, the opportunity to consult with experts in both the military and private sector, plus exceptional professional growth opportunities, which may include but are not limited to paid continuing education, clinical specialization, and residencies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Army reserve ====
The Army Reserve Nurse Corps begins with the Army Medical Department Basic Officer Leaders Course (BOLC), a three-week program that will expose nurses to the variety of mental and physical challenges they will face as a member of the United States Army's health care team. Candidates learn about the Army's approach to health care firsthand, train with other professionals, and attending lectures, conferences, and demonstrations that cover everything from U.S. Army customs to crisis management. Some candidates even have the opportunity to participate in a hands-on medical simulation of an in-theater field medical unit.

After completing BOLC, nurses will then begin serving with a Reserve unit a minimum of two days each month, and participate in annual training for at least two weeks each year. During this time, duties may include attending professional seminars and military or nursing education courses provided by the U.S. Army as well as the opportunity to work in a wide range of health care environments, whether it be in a modern hospital, working with skilled professionals in a variety of clinical situations or supervising paraprofessionals in a field medical unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ==
[[File:Logo of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.png|thumb|Walter Reed National Military Medical Center logo]]
[[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center|The Walter Reed National Military Medical Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r, formerly known as the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and was open from May 1909 to August 2011 then realigned with the National Naval Medical Center, is located in Washington, D.C. and serves more than 150,000 active and retired military personnel from all branches, admitting 16,000 patients a year. As a provider of specialized care and a referral center for the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command, WRNMMC offers a broad range of clinical and educational opportunities as well as focusing on integrated patient care, teaching, and research opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/amedd/health-care/facilities/walter-reed-army-medical-center.html|title=Walter Reed National Military Medical Center - Bethesda, Maryland|website=goarmy.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Early research began in the 1950s with the electrophysiology of neurons in the visual system provided the groundwork for [[David H. Hubel|Dr. David Hubel's]] 1981 Nobel Prize in Medicine. This standard of excellence has been kept with years of research innovations leading to over multiple patents for scientific contributions and numerous publications in high-impact journals such as [[Science (journal)|Science]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[the New England Journal of Medicine]], and [[JAMA (journal)|the Journal of the American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrair-www.army.mil/ReAndDevelop_MilPsychiatryAndNeuroscienceResearch.aspx|title=WRAIR - Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience|website=wrair-www.army.mil|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  The United States Army Medical Research Unit - Europe ====
The United States Army Medical Research Unit - Europe (USAMRU-E), a subordinate command of the Walter Reed National Military Center, is currently located in Heidelberg, Germany. USAMRU-E conducts applied psychological research to protect, optimize, and enhance psychological resilience for military members while also studying factors that can impact current stressors on the unit as well as the individual and their family. USAMRU-E focuses on command-directed behavioral health assessments and the development and validation of resilience training for the deployment cycle and the professional military education system. At USAMRU-E, individuals are exposed to a wide range of stressors that can negatively impact their behavioral health and well-being. Approximately 20% of those exposed report significant behavioral health problems upon returning from a combat deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrair-www.army.mil/Subordinate_UsamruE.aspx?id=USE|title=WRAIR - Subordinate Command. USAMRU-E|website=wrair-www.army.mil|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The National Capital Consortium Psychiatry Residency Program ===
The National Capital Consortium (NCC) Psychiatry Residency Program, which began in 1996, is unique and innovative graduate medical education program in psychiatry for military medical professionals. For over sixty years, neuropsychiatry investigators at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have worked to understand, prevent, and treat the poorly understood and untreated threats to military members health and performance that just "in their head."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Three military medical institutions, WRNMMC, [[Fort Belvoir Community Hospital]] (FBCH), and the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USUHS), are involved with this integrated psychiatry residency program while keeping the tradition of excellence in graduate medical education alive. NCC psychiatry residents consistently score among the highest in the nation on standard training examinations and a large number of graduates have gone on to become national and world leaders in psychiatry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrnmmc.capmed.mil/ResearchEducation/GME/SitePages/Psychiatry/Residency.aspx|title=The National Capital Consortium Psychiatry Residency Program - Walter Reed National Military Medical Center|website=wrnmmc.capmed.mil|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Program overview ====
The National Capital Military Psychiatry Residency is a four-year program designed to prepare military physicians and nurses for the practice of general psychiatry in the military and in community settings upon discharge from the military. The program's mission is to train military physicians and nurses to become effective psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in the variety of future roles they will fill, from military medical operations to multi-disciplinary mental health settings to primary care and other medical-surgical settings. Those who enroll in the psychiatric residency program apply their techniques of social science and psychiatric research to understand and address the many global and day-to-day pressures of military life affecting "mental health" and "psychological resilience." Military psychiatry, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology are particularly strong areas of emphasis of the program. Faculty members include nationally known leaders in a number of areas of psychiatry, including psychopharmacology, psychoanalysis, neuropsychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, consultation-liaison psychiatry, and military psychiatry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrair-www.army.mil/ReAndDevelop_MilPsycAndNeuro_MilitaryPsychiatry.aspx|title=WRAIR - Military Psychiatry|website=army.mil|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined residency training opportunities are also offered by the program. Army residents may apply for a 3+2 child psychiatry fellowship, and if accepted, may complete both general and child and adolescent psychiatry training in a total of five years. There is also a five-year combined internal medicine and psychiatry training program offered by the NCC Psychiatry and Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Graduates of this combined program complete requirements necessary for graduation from both residencies and for board certification in both general psychiatry and internal medicine. They also use traditional methods of individual and small-group interview, standard and specialized psychological tests and surveys, and objective measures such as the rates of suicide, re-enlistment, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to make wide-ranging assessments of slider and military family health and to recommend changes to organization, training, and leadership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Definition ==
Individuals experiencing religious delusions are preoccupied with religious subjects that are not within the expected beliefs for an individual's background, including culture, education, and known experiences of religion. These preoccupations are incongruous with the [[mood (psychology)|mood]] of the subject. Falling within the definition also are delusions arising in [[psychotic depression]]; however, these must present within a [[major depressive episode]] and be congruous with mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lieberman | first1=Jeffrey A. | last2=Stroup | first2 = T.

Researchers in a 2000 study found religious delusions to be unrelated to any specific set of diagnostic criteria, but correlated with demographic criteria, primarily age.&lt;ref name="raja2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. |last1=Raja |first2=A. |last2=Azzoni |first3=L. |last3=Lubich |year=2000 |title=Religious delusion: An observational study of religious delusion in a population of 313 acute psychiatric inpatients |journal=Schweizer Archiv f√ºr Neurologie und Psychiatrie |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=22‚Äì9 |url=http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322210939/http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF | archivedate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparative study sampling 313 patients, those with religious delusion were found to be aged older, and had been placed on a drug regime or started a treatment programme at an earlier stage. In the context of [[Medical sign|presentation]], their [[Global Assessment of Functioning|global functioning]] was found to be worse than another group of patients without religious delusions. The first group also scored higher on the [[Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms]] (SAPS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | publisher=Psychiatric [[University Hospital Zurich]] | last=Andreasen | first = Nancy C. | year=2007 |url=http://www.bli.uzh.ch/PDF/saps.pdf |title=SCALE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF POSITIVE SYMPTOMS | accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a greater total on the [[Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale]] (BPRS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | publisher=[[The University of Iowa]] | work = Iowa Coalition on Mental Health and Aging | url=http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/icmha/outreach/documents/BPRS_expanded.PDF | title=Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) | accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were treated with a higher mean number of [[neuroleptic]] medications of differing types during their hospitalization.&lt;ref name="raja2000"/&gt;

Religious delusion was found in 2007 to strongly correlate with "temporolimbic overactivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10398560601083118 |title=The Interface Between Religion and Psychosis |year=2007 |last1=Ng |first1=Felicity |author10=The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=62‚Äì66 | pmid = 17464638}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a condition where irregularities in the brain's [[limbic system]] may present as symptoms of [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/513.full.pdf | title = The Temporolimbic System Theory of Paranoid Schizophrenia | first = Manuel F. | last = Casanova | journal = [[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] | volume = 23 | number = 3 | year = 1997 | pages = 513‚Äì515 | publisher = Oxford University Press | doi=10.1093/schbul/23.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study, Swiss psychiatrists found religious delusions with themes of spiritual persecution by malevolent spirit-entities, control exerted over the person by spirit-entities, delusional experience of sin and guilt, or [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/psyc.2010.73.2.158 |title=Delusions with Religious Content in Patients with Psychosis: How They Interact with Spiritual Coping |year=2010 |last1=Mohr |first1=Sylvia |last2=Borras |first2=Laurence |last3=Betrisey |first3=Carine |last4=Pierre-Yves |first4=Brandt |last5=Gilli√©ron |first5=Christiane |last6=Huguelet |first6=Philippe |journal=Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=158‚Äì172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious delusions have generally been found to be less stressful than [[Delusion#Themes|other types of delusion]].&lt;ref name="raja2000" /&gt; A study found adherents to [[new religious movement]]s to have similar delusionary cognition, as rated by the Delusions Inventory, to a psychotic group, although the former reported feeling less distressed by their experiences than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1348/014466599162683 |title=Delusional ideation in religious and psychotic populations |year=1999 |last1=Peters |first1=Emmanuelle |last2=Day |first2=Samantha |last3=McKenna |first3=Jacqueline |last4=Orbach |first4=Gilli |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=38 |pages=83‚Äì96 |pmid=10212739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Behaviours out of the ordinary were traditionally viewed as [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0500960.htm | archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050222221921/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0500960.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2005-02-22 | year=2005 | work=Catholic News Service | accessdate=2012-01-23 | title=Real possession by devil not that common, exorcists say during lesson | last=Wooden | first=Cibndy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes, although entirely disavowed by modern psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Peck | first = M. Scott  | title=Glimpses of the Devil: a psychiatrist's personal accounts of possession, exorcism, and redemption | publisher=Simon and Schuster | date=4 Jan 2005 | isbn=0-7432-5467-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are evaluated by clinicians only such that they fall within the safety of a treatment programme.

Earlier{{when|date=March 2015}} propositions that religious shamans were motivated by delusions and that their behaviour resembled that of patients with [[schizophrenia]] were found to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/ae.1983.10.3.02a00030 |title=Shamanism and schizophrenia: A state-specific approach to the 'schizophrenia metaphor' of shamanic states |year=1983 |last1=Noll |first1=Richard |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=443‚Äì459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12018978 |year=2002 |last1=Polimeni |first1=J |last2=Reiss |first2=JP |title=How shamanism and group selection may reveal the origins of schizophrenia |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=244‚Äì8 |doi=10.1054/mehy.2001.1504 |journal=Medical Hypotheses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1937 essay, [[Sigmund Freud]] stated that he considered believing in a [[single god]] to be a delusion,&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; thus extending his 1907 comment that religion is the indication of obsessional neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/10573/subtopic/40000/ |title=Religion as obsessional neurosis |publisher=[[Freud Museum]] | last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/apt.10.4.287 |title=Working with patients with religious beliefs |year=2004 |last1=Dein |first1=S. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=287‚Äì294}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts defining "delusion" perhaps crystallized from the notion of the religion formulations of the common man (''circa'' 1927) as "patently infantile, foreign to reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/10573/subtopic/40005/ |title=Religion as a mass delusion |publisher=Freud Museum |last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the same year he also stated that religion "comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Future of an Illusion|last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1927 | isbn=978-0-393-00831-9 | oclc= 20479722}} cited in: {{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0101-60832007000700013 |title=Religion, spirituality and psychotic disorders |year=2007 |last1=Koenig |first1=Harold G. |journal=Revista de Psiquiatria Cl√≠nica |volume=34 |pages=95‚Äì104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Examples from a 295-subject study in [[Lithuania]] showed that the most common religious delusions were being a saint (in women) and being God (in men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18695349 |year=2008 |last1=Rudaleviciene |first1=P |last2=Stompe |first2=T |last3=Narbekovas |first3=A |last4=Raskauskiene |first4=N |last5=Bunevicius |first5=R |title=Are religious delusions related to religiosity in schizophrenia? |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=529‚Äì35 |journal=Medicina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study of 193 people who had previously been admitted to hospital and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, 24% were found to have religious delusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s001270200005 |title=Religious delusions in patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia |year=2002 |last1=Siddle |first1=Ronald |last2=Haddock |first2=Gillian |last3=Tarrier |first3=Nicholas |last4=Faragher |first4=E.Brian |journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=130‚Äì8 |pmid=11990010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 study identified that religious delusions were often present or expressed in persons with [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic]] committal to a psychiatric unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0087835 |title=Understanding the religious ideation of forensically committed patients |year=1999 |last1=Kunst |first1=Jennifer L. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=287‚Äì297 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pst/36/3/287/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical examples==

===Biblical===
{{see also|Neuroscience of religion|Psychology of religion|Mental health of Jesus}}
Although many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious practices and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kind ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[psychiatric disorders]]). In 2011, a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]] and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and [[hyperreligiosity]].&lt;ref name="JNCN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsichiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410‚Äì426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=March 22, 2018 |issn=1545-7222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They compared the thought and behavior of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

In 1998‚Äì2000 [[Poles|Pole]] Leszek Nowak (born 1962)&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Polish philosopher and lawyer [[Leszek Nowak]] (1943‚Äì2009) also from Pozna≈Ñ.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Pozna≈Ñ]] authored a study in which, based on his own history of religious delusions of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus‚Ä≤ psyche&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160514125307/http://www.opracowanie.eu/index_2.htm Prywatna Witryna Internetowa Leszka Nowaka] at [[Internet Archive]] (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; with the view of [[Portraits of the historical Jesus#Apocalyptic prophet|Jesus as apocalyptic prophet]].&lt;ref name=Nowak&gt;Analysis of fragments of the New Testament books for Jesus as apocalyptic prophet: Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160523101437/http://www.opracowanie.eu/pomylka_2.htm ‚Ä≥A great mistake and disappointment of early Christianity‚Ä≥] at [[Internet Archive]] (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; He does so in chapters containing, in sequence, an analysis of character traits of the ‚Ä≥savior of mankind‚Ä≥, a description of the possible course of events from the period of Jesus' public activity, a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] explanation of miracles.

===Historical===
A religious experience of communication from heavenly or divine beings could be interpreted as a test of faith. An example of such is [[Joan of Arc]], ''La Pucelle d'Orl√©ans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A1NrfO2uFNAC | title = A Still, Small Voice: A Practical Guide on Reporting Revelations | first = Father Benedict J. | last = Groeschel | publisher = Ignatius Press | year = 1993 | pages = 52‚Äì53| isbn = 9780898704365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who rallied French forces late in the [[Hundred Years' War]].

[[Daniel Paul Schreber]] is an example of a supposed religious delusion occurring in a developed condition of psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Corveleyn | first=Jozef | chapter=Religious Delusion in Psychosis and Hysteria | title=Changing the Scientific Study of Religion: Beyond Freud? | editor-first=J. A. |editor-last=Belzen | year=2009 | publisher=Springer | isbn=9789048125401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schreber was a successful and highly respected German judge until middle age, when he came to believe that God was turning him into a woman. Two of his three illnesses (1884‚Äì1885 and 1893‚Äì1902) are described in his book ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness'' (original German title ''Denkw√ºrdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schreber | first =Daniel Paul | title =Memoirs of My Nervous Illness | publisher =New York Review of Books, 2000 | year = 1903 | location =New York | isbn = 0-940322-20-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became an influential book in the history of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] thanks to its interpretation by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref #Freud&gt;{{cite book | last =Freud | first =Sigmund | authorlink =Sigmund Freud | last2 =Webber | first2 =Andrew (translator) | last3 =MacCabe | first3 =Colin (contributor) | authorlink3 =Colin MacCabe | title =The Schreber Case | publisher =Penguin Classics Psychology, 2003 | year = 1911 | location =New York | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iY1917GJxqEC&amp;pg=PR22&amp;lpg=PR22&amp;dq=isbn=0142437425#PPP1,M1 | isbn = 0-14-243742-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Medical School research also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum."&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

===Auditory hallucination and crime===
An individual may hear communication from heavenly or divine beings compelling one to [[religious violence|commit acts of violence]]. Some cite the case of the Hebrew patriarch [[Abraham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Katz | first=Claire Elise | title=The Voice of God and the Face of the Other: Levinas, Kierkegaard, and Abraham | journal=The Journal of Textual Reasoning | date=2001 | url=http://jtr.lib.virginia.edu/archive/volume10/Katz.html | volume=10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225214716/http://jtr.lib.virginia.edu/archive/volume10/Katz.html | archivedate=2013-12-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was commanded by God to [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice his son Isaac]]. However, when Abraham was prepared to act on it, God informed him that this was only a test of faith and forbade any human sacrifice.

In contemporary times persons judged to have experienced [[auditory hallucination]] include those hearing voices instructing or motivating them to commit violent acts. These auditory experiences are classified by psychiatry as [[command hallucination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18477881 |year=2008 |last1=Shawyer |first1=F |last2=MacKinnon |first2=A |last3=Farhall |first3=J |last4=Sims |first4=E |last5=Blaney |first5=S |last6=Yardley |first6=P |last7=Daly |first7=M |last8=Mullen |first8=P |last9=Copolov |first9=D |title=Acting on harmful command hallucinations in psychotic disorders: An integrative approach |volume=196 |issue=5 |pages=390‚Äì8 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318171093b |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease }}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons acting to commit [[murder]] are reported as hearing voices of religious beings such as [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gaines | first = James | authorlink = James R.

Within the [[anti-psychiatry]] community, Professor Thomas Szasz critiques the concept of religious auditory hallucination: those who hear the voice of God talking to them are experiencing schizophrenia, while those who talk to God but hear no response are simply [[Prayer|praying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Citizens Commission on Human Rights International | title=Professor Thomas Szasz on Schizophrenia as a Disease | accessdate=23 January 2012 | url=http://www.cchrint.org/about-us/co-founder-dr-thomas-szasz/quotes-on-schizophrenia-as-a-disease/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Milne Murray''' [[FRSE]] FRCPE FRSSA (6 May 1855 ‚Äì 14 February 1904) was a Scottish surgeon and medical author. Specialising in gynaecology he ran the Edinburgh Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Hospital, He was the first medical Electrician at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] but refused to patent any of the devices which he created and instead openly showed the apparatus to vising European colleagues to be feely copied.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Robert Milne Murray, M.A.St. And., M.D.Edin., F.R.C.P.E., F.R.S.E|date=27 February 1904|publisher=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=2252|pages=521‚Äì522|pmc=2353217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born at [[Fettercairn]] on 6 May 1855 the son of the local schoolmaster.

He studied Science at [[St Andrews University]] graduating MA around 1875. After some time assisting Prof [[Matthew Forster Heddle]] he went to [[Edinburgh University]] to study Medicine graduating MB ChB in 1879. He then became assistant to [[John Halliday Croom]] under whom he gained much knowledge in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology.

In 1886 he began Lecturing in Midwifery and Diseases of Women. He was President of the Gynaecological Society of Edinburgh and Vice President of the British Gynaecological Society. He was Vice President of the [[Royal Scottish Society of the Arts]]. He maintaines a private laboratory at Rutland Square.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29316">The '''Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment''' (also known as the '''Rohrabacher‚ÄìBlumenauer amendment''') is legislation first introduced by U.S. Rep. [[Maurice Hinchey]] in 2001, prohibiting the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical cannabis]] laws. It passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] in May 2014 after six previously failed attempts, becoming law in December 2014 as part of an [[omnibus spending bill]]. The passage of the amendment was the first time either chamber of Congress had voted to protect medical cannabis patients, and is viewed as a historic victory for cannabis reform advocates at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=German|title=The House just voted to protect medical marijuana patients from federal interference|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5763654/the-house-just-voted-to-protect-medical-marijuana-patients-from|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Vox|date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not change the legal status of cannabis however, and must be renewed each fiscal year in order to remain in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=The Federal Ban on Medical Marijuana Was Not Lifted|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/04/the-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-was|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Reason|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
Initially introduced by Rep. Hinchey in 2001, the amendment was withdrawn before it could be brought to a vote.&lt;ref name="Hinchey RIP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Federal Medical Marijuana Amendment Author Dies At 79|url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-medical-marijuana-amendment-author-dies-79/|accessdate=November 24, 2017|work=Marijuana Moment|date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Hinchey joined with Rep. [[Dana Rohrabacher]] to introduce the amendment, leading to a 152‚Äì273 defeat the first time the amendment was voted on.&lt;ref name="Hinchey RIP" /&gt; The Hinchey‚ÄìRohrabacher amendment failed five more times over the next decade, until it passed the House (as the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment) by a 219‚Äì189 vote on May 30, 2014, as an attachment to the [[Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015|Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill]] for fiscal year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherer|first1=Steph|title=First major victory in the fight to end federal interference|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/first_major_victory_in_the_fight_to_end_federal_interference|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was then introduced in the Senate by Sens. [[Rand Paul]] and [[Cory Booker]] on June 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|title=Senate Could Follow House In Blocking DEA From Targeting Medical Marijuana|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/rand-paul-medical-marijuana_n_5511734.html|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not allowed a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Piper|first1=Bill|title=A Decade of Hard Work Turns into Historic Marijuana Victory in Congress|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/decade-hard-work-turns-historic-marijuana-victory-congress|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Drug Policy Alliance|date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, however, the amendment was inserted into the $1.1 trillion "cromnibus" spending bill as part of final negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Congress Set to Pass Landmark Medical Marijuana Legislation|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_set_to_pass_landmark_medical_marijuana_legislation|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was signed into law by [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Obama]] on December 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hermes|first1=Kris|title=Feds Back off Medical Marijuana Enforcement in 32 States and DC|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/feds_back_off_medical_marijuana_enforcement_in_32_states_and_dc|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment passed the House for a second time on June 3, 2015, by a 242‚Äì186 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=June 4, 2015|title=Rohrabacher Hails Passage of Medical Marijuana Amendment|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-hails-passage-of-medical-marijuana-amendment|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was voted on by members of the Senate for the first time on June 11, 2015, winning approval in a 21‚Äì9 [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] vote led by sponsor [[Barbara Mikulski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Senate Committee Approves Mikulski Medical Marijuana Amendment with Strong Bipartisan Support|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/senate_committee_approves_mikulski_medical_marijuana_amendment_with_strong_bipartisan_support|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment remained in the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|FY 2016 omnibus appropriations bill]] that was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Congress Set to Reauthorize the Rohrabacher-Farr Medical Cannabis Amendment|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_set_to_reauthorize_the_rohrabacher_farr_medical_cannabis_amendment|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherer|first1=Steph|title=Congress Extends ‚ÄòCeasefire‚Äô On Medical Marijuana, but Can They Clear the Smoke?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steph-sherer/congress-extends-ceasefir_b_8853606.html|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment was not voted on by the House in 2016, but did pass the Senate Appropriations Committee for a second time on April 21, 2016, by a 21‚Äì8 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Senators Vote to Bar DEA From Harassing Medical Marijuana Patients|url=http://www.marijuana.com/blog/news/2016/04/senators-vote-to-bar-dea-from-harassing-medical-marijuana-patients/|accessdate=January 3, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was later renewed in a pair of spending bills signed into law on September 29 and December 10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Nick|title=BREAKING: Rohrabacher-Farr Extended Until December|url=https://www.marijuanatimes.org/breaking-rohrabacher-farr-extended-until-december/|accessdate=January 2, 2017|work=The Marijuana Times|date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Congress Votes to Extend Rohrabacher-Farr Through April|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_votes_to_extend_rohrabacher_farr_through_april|accessdate=January 2, 2017|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again for an additional week on April 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal medical cannabis protections extended another week|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/federal-medical-cannabis-protections-extended-another-week/|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=Marijuana Business Daily|date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2017, the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment was renewed until September 30, 2017, as part of a $1 trillion spending bill signed into law by [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]]. In regards to the medical cannabis provision, Trump added a [[signing statement]] that read: "Division B, section 537 provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories. I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Trump Might Ignore Congress‚Äôs Medical Marijuana Rider|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/trump-might-ignore-congresss-medical-marijuana-rider|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=Trump's Medical Marijuana Threat Contradicts the Law and His Own Position|url=http://reason.com/blog/2017/05/08/trumps-medical-marijuana-threat-contradi|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=Reason|date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the spending bill was signed into law, Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] wrote to congressional leaders urging that the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment not be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Exclusive: Sessions Asks Congress To Undo Medical Marijuana Protections|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/exclusive-sessions-asks-congress-to-undo-medical-marijuana-protections|accessdate=June 12, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved inclusion of the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment in the CJS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018, in a [[voice vote]] led by sponsor Sen. [[Patrick Leahy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Senators OK State Medical Marijuana Protections, Rejecting Sessions|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/senators-ok-state-medical-marijuana-protections-rejecting-sessions|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, however, the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Committee on Rules]] blocked a vote on the amendment, due to Republican leadership viewing it as too divisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labak|first1=Aleta|title=GOP-led House Rules Committee blocks voting on bipartisan marijuana amendments|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/06/house-rules-committee-rejects-marijuana-amendments-spending-bill-2/87472/|accessdate=September 10, 2017|work=The Cannabist|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was then renewed on September 8 as part of an emergency aid package,&lt;ref name="Schroyer renew"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schroyer|first1=John|title=Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment extended until December|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/rohrabacher-blumenauer-amendment-extended-december/|accessdate=September 10, 2017|work=Marijuana Business Daily|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again through a series of stopgap spending bills on December 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasquariello|first1=Alex|last2=Wallace|first2=Alicia|title=Federal marijuana protections safe for now with stopgap spending bill|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/07/federal-budget-medical-marijuana-rohrabacher-blumenauer/94177/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=The Cannabist|date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; December 22,&lt;ref name="Dec 22 renew"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasquariello|first1=Alex|title=Trump signs stopgap spending bill extending federal medical marijuana protections for a few more weeks|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/22/federal-budget-medical-marijuana-rohrabacher-blumenauer-extended/95178/|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=The Cannabist|date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 22,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodes|first1=David|title=Senate Revives Gov‚Äôt, and Medical Marijuana Protections, Until Feb. 8|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/senate-revives-govt-and-medical-marijuana-protections-until-feb-8|accessdate=January 22, 2018|work=Leafly|date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and February 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schroyer|first1=John|title=Federal medical cannabis protection extended again|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/federal-medical-cannabis-protection-extended/|accessdate=February 9, 2018|work=Marijuana Business Daily|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (briefly expiring on January 20).&lt;ref name="Dec 22 renew" /&gt; On March 23, the amendment was renewed as part of an omnibus spending bill, in effect through September 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump signs spending bill that includes medical marijuana protections|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/trump-signs-spending-bill-includes-medical-marijuana-protections/|accessdate=March 23, 2018|work=Marijuana Business Daily|date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House votes===
The Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment has been introduced on the House floor nine times. It was initially known as the Hinchey‚ÄìRohrabacher amendment until [[Maurice Hinchey|Rep. Hinchey]] retired in January 2013, after which Reps. [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and [[Sam Farr]] took over as lead sponsor and co-sponsor.&lt;ref name="Hinchey RIP" /&gt; In January 2017, Rep. Farr retired from Congress, with Rep. [[Earl Blumenauer]] taking over as future lead co-sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Alicia|title=44 in Congress support effort to keep DOJ handcuffed in medical cannabis states|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/10/doj-medical-cannabis-states-rohrabacher-amendment-letter-congress/76993/|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=The Cannabist|date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment in 2014 was noted for its rare [[bipartisan]] support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dumain|first1=Emma|title=House Marijuana Votes Earn Backing of Rare Bipartisan Coalition (Video)|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/breaking-down-the-votes-on-the-house-medical-marijuana-amendment|accessdate=January 2, 2017|work=Roll Call|date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; garnering the approval of 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 258|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll258.xml|website=house.gov|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the notable "no" votes was [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chair [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]], who was the only member of Democratic leadership to vote against it.&lt;ref name="hp schultz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=New Ads Target Members Of Congress Who Opposed Medical Marijuana Measure|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/05/congress-medical-marijuana_n_5455377.html|accessdate=January 2, 2017|work=The Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical cannabis advocacy group [[Americans for Safe Access]] subsequently targeted Schultz with a TV ad criticizing her vote against the amendment.&lt;ref name="hp schultz" /&gt;

The Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment passed the House in 2015 with the support of 67 Republicans and 175 Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 283|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll283.xml|website=house.gov|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment text==
The full text of the 2014 House amendment is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment Text: H.Amdt.748 ‚Äî 113th Congress (2013‚Äì2014)|url=https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/748/text|website=congress.gov|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Implementation==
The Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment became law in December 2014, but initially failed to have its intended impact, due to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] interpreting the amendment in an incorrect manner (as later determined by a pair of court rulings). Contrary to the amendment's popular interpretation, the DOJ argued that only state officials were protected from prosecution, and not private individuals or entities involved in the production or distribution of medical cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=The Justice Department's Embarrassing Medical Marijuana Switcheroo|url=http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/06/the-justice-departments-embarrassing-med|accessdate=September 16, 2017|work=Reason|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since state officials were not being prosecuted to begin with, the DOJ's position was essentially that the amendment had no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=How the Justice Department seems to have misled Congress on medical marijuana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/06/the-justice-department-says-it-misled-congress-on-medical-marijuana/|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stance conflicted with the DOJ's earlier position (leading up to the May 2014 vote), when it advised members of Congress that the amendment's protections could actually apply more broadly than intended, to cover [[Recreational drug use|recreational]] cannabis as well (in addition to medical).&lt;ref name="Angell memo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Exclusive: Justice Department Admits Misleading Congress on Marijuana Vote|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2015/08/exclusive-justice-department-admits-misleading-congress-on-marijuana-vote/|accessdate=September 16, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the amendment's enactment, the Justice Department continued to prosecute medical cannabis providers in accordance with the new interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zilversmit|first1=Marc|title=Obama‚Äôs Iran-Contra ‚Äì The president is spending money that Congress has explicitly told him he can‚Äôt spend|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/04/obama_s_medical_marijuana_prosecutions_probably_aren_t_legal.html|accessdate=September 16, 2017|work=Slate|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions consequently drew protests from Rohrabacher and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downs|first1=David|title=Congressman blasts San Francisco medical pot prosecutions|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2015/02/16/congressman-blasts-san-francisco-medical-pot-prosecutions/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Smell the Truth|publisher=SFGate|date=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=Is the DOJ Defying Congress by Pursuing Medical Marijuana Cases?|url=https://reason.com/blog/2015/02/17/is-the-doj-defying-congress-by-pursuing|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Reason|date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who charged that both the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter and the spirit]] of the amendment were being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Reaction / response by Reps.

In October 2015, a court ruling by U.S. District Judge [[Charles R. Breyer|Charles Breyer]] affirmed the meaning of Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr as the authors originally intended, providing supporters of the amendment with a key legal victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Molly|title=Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Win Battle Against Federal Crackdown|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medical-marijuana-ruling_us_56265df9e4b08589ef48fee0|accessdate=June 16, 2017|work=HuffPost|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Breyer in his decision was especially critical of the DOJ interpretation, stating that it "defies language and logic" and "tortures the plain meaning of the statute", and was "counterintuitive and opportunistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=Federal court tells the DEA to stop harassing medical marijuana providers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/20/federal-court-tells-the-dea-to-stop-harassing-medical-marijuana-providers/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling lifted an [[injunction]] against a California dispensary, the Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana, and was considered to set important legal precedent inhibiting future prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downs|first1=David|title=Major victory for marijuana dispensary in federal court|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2015/10/19/major-victory-for-marijuana-dispensary-in-federal-court/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Smell the Truth|publisher=SFGate|date=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downs|first1=David|title=‚ÄòWe Won the War!‚Äô: Reaction to Landmark Medical Marijuana Ruling|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/LegalizationNation/archives/2015/10/21/we-won-the-war-reaction-to-landmark-medical-marijuana-ruling|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Legalization Nation|publisher=East Bay Express|date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department appealed Breyer's ruling, but in April 2016 it withdrew the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=DOJ Accepts Decision Saying It May Not Target State-Legal Medical Marijuana Suppliers|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/14/doj-accepts-ruling-that-says-it-may-not|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Reason|date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feds Finally End 18-Year Fight Against MMJ Pioneer Lynnette Shaw|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/feds-finally-end-18-year-fight-against-mmj-pioneer-lynette-shaw|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Leafly|date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the DOJ interpretation was rejected by the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] as well, in a separate case consolidating the appeals of 10 medical cannabis providers in the states of California and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=The Largest Federal Appeals Court Tells DOJ To Back Off State-Legal Medical Marijuana|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medical-marijuana-9th-circuit_us_57b36a31e4b04ff883990337|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unanimous ruling of the three-judge panel is binding on the nine western states of the Ninth Circuit, and is considered likely to hold influence on other circuit courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Maura|title=Feds can't spend money to prosecute people who comply with state medical pot laws, court rules|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-medical-pot-20160816-snap-story.html|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Victory ‚Äì Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment Continues to Help Medical Marijuana Defendants in Federal Court|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/victory_rohrabacher_farr_amendment_continues_to_help_medical_marijuana_defendants_in_federal_court|accessdate=January 4, 2017|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technostress''' is the negative psychological link between people and the introduction of new technologies.  Where [[ergonomics]] is the study of how humans react to and physically fit with machines in their environment, technostress is a result of altered habits of work and collaboration that are being brought about due to the use of modern information technologies at office and home situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sami |first1= Lalitha Krishna |last2= Iffat |first2= Rabia |year= 2010|title= Impact of Electronic Services on Users: A Study |journal= JLIS.it|volume=1 |issue= 2|publisher= University of Florence|doi= 10.4403/jlis.it-4523|url= http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/4523|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People experience technostress when they cannot adapt to or cope with information technologies in a healthy manner. They feel compulsive about being connected and sharing constant updates, feel forced to respond to work-related information in real-time, and engage in almost  habitual multi-tasking. They feel compelled to work faster because information flows faster, and have little time to spend on sustained thinking and creative analysis.

Craig Brod, a leader in the field of technostress research, states that technostress  is "a modern [[disease]] of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy manner."&lt;ref&gt;Brod, Craig.  ''Technostress:  The Human Cost of the Computer Revolution''. Reading, Mass:  Addison Weslety, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest technostress scholarly studies in the field of Management Information Systems show that  technostress is an undesirable phenomenon spawned by use of computing and communication devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. It is dependent on gender, age and computer literacy. Women experience lower technostress than men, older people experience less technostress at work than younger people and those with greater computer literacy experience lower technostress.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;Tarafdar, M., Ragu-Nathan, T.S., Ragu-Nathan, B. and Tu, Q., ''The Impact of Technostress on Productivity'', Journal of Management Information Systems, Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Consequence"&gt;Ragu-Nathan, T.S., Tarafdar, M., Ragu-Nathan, B. and Tu, Q., ''Consequence of Technostress in End Users: Conceptual Development and Empirical Validation'', Information Systems Research, December 2008, 19, 4, 417-433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarafdar, M,  Tu, Q., Ragu-Nathan, T.S and Ragu-Nathan, B.S.

==Symptoms and outcomes==

Psychological [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] can manifest itself physically.  Similarly there are a number of symptoms of technostress. One [[symptom]] of technostress is anxiety.  Anxiety can appear as: irritability, [[headache]]s, backaches, eye strain, neck pain, stiff shoulder, joint pains, mental [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nightmare]]s, [[panic]], [[Psychological Resistance|resistance]], and a feeling of helplessness. The [[anxiety]] expressed by those experiencing technostress: insomnia, loss of temper, irritability, frustration and can increase errors in judgement and poor [[job performance]] if not dealt with.

In the 21st century, people equipped with technology at the workplace are most especially those experiencing technostress. People are sitting and facing computer monitors for a longer time which results in physical strain. In the 21st century work environment, people spend hours day at work because it is critical to their security and job satisfaction. However, these demands are becoming increasingly hazardous to their health. In a technological world, providing people with appropriate and safe physical environment is a necessity. Too much exposure to computer monitors is associated with emotional stress, and people are emotionally affected by technostress in their workplaces.

Consequences of technostress include decreased job satisfaction, organizational commitment and productivity. A periodic assessment is necessary to check the level of technostress affecting professionals especially the physical and emotional aspects. Managers should organize technology-based trainings for employees to make them comfortable with technologies and awareness of their harmful effects. Technology skills for employees are important to consistently update their technological skills. Institutions, companies, and agencies are needed to employ IT specialists and troubleshooters to maximize system accessibility and provide a level of comfort to the employee.

'''The causes of technostress amount to:'''&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, Lisa A.  "The Evolution of Technostress."  ''Computers in Libraries,'' Sept. 2005, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The quick pace of technological change
*Lack of proper training
*An increased [[workload]]
*Lack of [[standardization]] within technologies
*The reliability of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]

'''Four Aspects of Technostress:'''

# Physical aspects are eye strain, backaches, headaches, stiff shoulders, neck pain, joint pain, dry mouth and throat, muscle tension, stomach discomfort, keyboard related injuries, chest pain, rapid heart rate, irritable bowel syndrome, increased blood pressure and difficulty in breathing. 
# Emotional aspects like irritability, loss of temper, having a high state of anxiety when separated from a computer monitor, feelings of indifference, frustration, lack of appreciation, depression, guilt, feeling fearful, paranoia that leads to avoiding computers and negative attitudes. 
# Behavioral aspects consists of feeling overly comfortable with computers, overspending on computers, insomnia, uncooperativeness and unwillingness, using computer terms in non-computer conversation, smoking, social withdrawal in favor of terminal time, cruising computer stores and drinking alcohol. 
# Psychological aspects are composed of information overload in order to find, analyze, evaluate, and apply it in the right context with resources, underwork and routine jobs lead to frustrations when underemployed or when the work done involves only routine operations, job security, where people have a fear that computers may replace human roles, professional jealousy produced by technological competency, de-motivation due to prolonged periods of any technological activity, uncertainty about job role caused by an increased time working with technology.

There are five conditions that are classified as "technostress creators":&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
#"Techno-overload" describes situations where use of computers forces people to work more and work faster.
#"Techno-invasion" describes being ‚Äúalways exposed‚Äù where people can potentially be reached anywhere and any time and feel the need to be constantly connected. The regular work-day is extended, office work is done at all sorts of hours, and it is almost impossible to "cut away." 
#"Techno-complexity" describes situations where the complex computer systems used at work force people to spend time and effort in learning and understanding how to use new applications and to update their skills. People find the variety of applications, functions, and jargon intimidating and consequently feel stressed.
#"Techno-insecurity" is associated with situations where people feel threatened about losing their jobs to other people who have a better understanding of new gadgets and computing devices.
#"Techno-uncertainty" relates to short life cycles of computer systems. Continuing changes and upgrades do not give people a chance to acquire experience with a particular system. People find this unsettling because their knowledge becomes rapidly outdated and they are required to re-learn things very rapidly and often.

==Coping strategies==
Technostress can be treated by getting [[user friendly]] software and educating people about new technology and creating better level of reassurance, patience and stability and [[communication]] within the job environment. Other option is avoid or restrict use of technology. 

Ways to eliminate technostress are&lt;ref name="Consequence"/&gt; conducting stress management activities to lessen and eliminate the problem of technostress such as exercise, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, positive self talk, staying healthy and having healthy diet. Taking frequent breaks from technology, having a schedule, counseling, having awareness of technostress, establishing a teamwork relationship with colleagues may help.

The '''Tiffin Cup''' is an annual British competition run by the Tiffin Club to find the best [[South Asia]]n restaurant in the United Kingdom. Nominees are selected by their constituency and then put forward by their local [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s. One restaurant from every region is then shortlisted and invited to participate in the Grand Final cook-off event held in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], as judged by MPs and guest celebrities, with the proceeds going to a selected charity.

==History of Tiffin==
The name tiffin is given to the containers that transported light meals. The tiffins, or tiffinboxes are made up of three porcelain round trays with handles and lids in which lunches are delivered to workers. They are delivered through a complex network of [[Dabbawala|Dabbawallahs]], who set off with the dishes after the men have left for work. This practice is still in use in India today.

The word [[tiffin]] is also used to refer to taking a little light snack, including a cup of tea. It probably came into use when it became more popular to have a full meal in the evening rather than mid-afternoon, thus requiring a lighter meal at around midday that needed a name.

==Past Winners==
2006 - Taj Mahal Indian Restaurant, [[Preseli Pembrokeshire]]

2007 - Bekash, [[Romford (UK Parliament constituency)|Romford]]

2008 - Mint and Mustard, [[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]]

2013 - The competition included Ainsley Harriet as the chair of a panel of judges.

Notable mention to the Bilash Balti in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, which was the first restaurant in the Fylde to win the Best in the North West category.


2010 - A record 74 nominations were received by the Tiffin Club! The Launch of the ''Newby Teas'' Tiffin Cup 2010 was on Tuesday 14 September 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3998">'''Toxic cough syrup''' refers to a 2007 scandal in which [[Panama]]nian [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturers produced [[cough syrup]] using [[diethylene glycol]] which they believed to be [[glycerine]]. Diethylene glycol is a less-expensive alternative to glycerine for industrial applications, however, diethylene glycol is [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] and can result in [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] (MODS), especially in children.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/world/americas/06poison.html |quote=The syrupy poison, diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some antifreeze. |title=From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine |last1=Bogdanich |first1=Walt |last2=Hooker |first2=Jake |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There were poisonings in Panama, China, Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria, and India (twice) between 1992 and 2007, due to contaminated cough syrup and other medications that incorporated inexpensive [[diethylene glycol]] instead of the intended [[glycerin]]. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/world/06poison.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine |last1=Bogdanich |first1=Walt |last2=Hooker |first2=Jake |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Panama, the imported [[diethylene glycol]] came from a [[China|Chinese]] manufacturer, sold under the unfortunate name '''TD glycerine''', which means 'glycerine substitute'. A [[Spain|Spanish]] middleman filling the [[customs declaration]] changed the name to glycerine.

The [[China Food and Drug Administration]] did not regard the toxic cough syrup scandal as being China's fault. The Chinese manufacturer exported the [[diethylene glycol]] under the name '''TD glycerine''', but the Spanish middleman Aduanas Javier de Gracia changed the name to '''glycerine''' when he filled the customs declaration in Panama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.cn/xwzx/gnsz/gdxw/200705/17/t20070517_11386599_2.shtml ÊØíÁ≥ñÊµÜÂ∑¥ÊãøÈ©¨Ëá¥Ê≠ªÁôæ‰∫∫ ÊàëËçØÁõëÂ±ÄÁß∞Ë¥£‰ªª‰∏çÂú®‰∏≠Êñπ]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}{{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-05-31/153713122468.shtml Ë¥®Ê£ÄÊÄªÂ±ÄÔºöÂ∑¥ÊãøÈ©¨ËçØÂìÅ‰∏≠ÊØí‰∫ã‰ª∂Ë¥£‰ªªÂú®Â∑¥ÂïÜ‰∫∫]{{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh incident==
Discovering and tracing a toxic syrup to its source has been difficult for [[health care]] providers and governmental agencies due to difficult communication between the governments of [[developed|developed countries]] and [[developing countries]]. For example, Dr. [[Michael L. Bennish]], an American pediatrician who works in developing countries, had been volunteering in [[Bangladesh]] as a physician and had noticed a number of deaths that seemed to coincide with the distribution of the government-issued cough syrup. The government rebuffed his attempts at investigating the medication. In response, Dr. Bennish smuggled bottles of the syrup in his suitcase when returning to the [[United States]], allowing pharmaceutical laboratories in [[Massachusetts]] to identify the poisonous [[diethylene glycol]], which can appear very similar to the less dangerous [[glycerine]]. Dr. Bennish went on to author a 1995 article in the [[British Medical Journal]] about his experience, writing that, given the amount of medication prescribed, [[death toll]]s "must [already] be in the tens of thousands."&lt;ref name = "nytimes"/&gt;

It has been practiced in Africa ([[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]]&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;), Asia ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]]&lt;ref name=jwh&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hull |first1=T |last2=Hilber |first2=AM |last3=Chersich |first3=MF |last4=Bagnol |first4=B |last5=Prohmmo |first5=A |last6=Smit |first6=JA |last7=Widyantoro |first7=N |last8=Utomo |first8=ID |last9=Fran√ßois |first9=I |last10=Tumwesigye |first10=NM |last11=Temmerman |first11=M |last12=WHO GSVP Study |first12=Group. |title=Prevalence, motivations, and adverse effects of vaginal practices in Africa and Asia: findings from a multicountry household survey. |journal=Journal of women's health (2002) |date=July 2011 |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=1097-109 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.2281 |pmid=21668355|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Central America]] (among the [[Q'eqchi' people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjqgBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56|title=Q‚Äôeqchi‚Äô Maya Reproductive Ethnomedicine|publisher=Spring|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

It has become a fad for women in the Western world. It is described in spas as an [[Traditional Korean medicine|ancient Korean treatment]] for reproductive organ ailments and is claimed to have other benefits. There is no empirical evidence supporting any of these claims.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
According to a study on [[vagina]]l practices by the [[World Health Organization]] published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by "Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke".&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt; For that study, over 4,000 women in  Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, "which they associated with  maintaining  wellness  and  feminine  identity", especially after [[Postpartum period|having given birth]] (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, "mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)". In the two African locations, 37‚Äì38% of women said they practiced it to enhance "male sexual pleasure"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their "feminine identity" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;

==Risks==
[[Side effect]] and potential dangers include: [[allergic reactions]], [[second-degree burns]] if the steam is too close,&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; and [[vaginal infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Marketing===
Vaginal steaming is marketed with pseudoscientific notions of "balancing" female hormones and "revitalizing" the [[uterus]] or vagina.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea|title=Sorry, Gwyneth Paltrow, but steaming your vagina is a bad idea|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=9 March 2017|last=Robinson|first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gunter |first1=Jen |title=Gwyneth Paltrow says steam your vagina, an OB/GYN says don‚Äôt |url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/gwyneth-paltrow-says-steam-your-vagina-an-obgyn-says-dont/ |work=Dr. Jen Gunter Wielding the Lasso of Truth |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also claimed to: reduce the discomfort, bloating and tiredness associated with [[menstruation]], regulate irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s, treat [[Vaginal yeast infection|yeast infections]], decrease the menstrual blood flow, increase fertility, relieve symptoms of [[menopause]], treat [[endometriosis]], speed up the after-birth healing process.  There is no evidence for any of those claims.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; 

It is also marketed as "cleaning" the vagina, which it does not do, and which is not necessary.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

The marketing and perception of vaginal steaming falls within a mix of ideologies including [[post-feminist]], [[new age]], and inherently [[sexist]] notions in which the female body is on the one hand a dirty, defective thing, yet one that a woman can "optimize" to become "goddess-like".&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite article|title='Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina': unpacking Western representations of vaginal steaming |first1=Tycho |last1=Vandenburg |first2=Virginia |last2=Braun |work=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality |volume=19 |number=4 |year=2017|pmid=27719108}} (taking as its title one observer's characterization{{snd}}"Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina") {{cite article|title=I Went To A Spa For My Uterus And This Is My Story |work=Fast Company |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041307/body-week/i-went-to-a-spa-for-my-uterus-and-this-is-my-story |last=Beck|first=Laura Hopper |date=January 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xylit''' (from ''xylon'', ¬´ [[wood]] ¬ª) is a waste reclamation obtained all around the world from the mining of [[lignite]].

Like in the [[peat]], we can still observe the wooden structures not completely [[Sedimentary rock|sedimented]].

Its [[density]] is around 400&amp;nbsp;kg/m¬≥ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xylit - √©puration des eaux|url=http://www.aquaterra-solutions.com/pdf/depliants/XYLIT-Epuration-des-eaux_Page_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Its very low [[heat content]], even in dried state, makes it considered as [[coal rank|insufficient rank]] of [[coal]]. It is not used as fuel for heat generation.

Xylit is sometimes used for the production of [[potting soil]] and professional substrate for [[horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xylit_(Kohle)&amp;oldid=169868836&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its good mechanical characteristics, with more elasticity and robustness than wood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xylit - √©puration des eaux|url=http://www.aquaterra-solutions.com/pdf/depliants/XYLIT-Epuration-des-eaux_Page_2.pdf|website=Aquaterra solutions|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its good filtering characteristics, Xylit is sometimes used as wood chips or water filtration for water filtration.

Its unique structure, that allow nutrients and pollutants to fix on it, its high [[specific surface area]] (encouraging [[trickling filter]] development) and its exceptional longevity (30 years) allow to be used as a very high quality filter. It is used as filter media in some [[decentralized wastewater system]]s.

It has been proven in [[France]] that it could be turned in [[compost]]

== Commercial uses ==

* The Belgian company [[w:fr:Eloy (entreprise)|Eloy]] uses Xylit as filtering media in its X-Perco
* The Aquaterra company uses Xylit as riverbanks stabilization
