{{Politics of the Maldives}}

The '''Administrative Divisions of the Maldives''' refers to the various units of government that provide [[local government]] services in the [[Maldives]]. According to the [[Administrative Divisions of the Maldives|Decentralization Act 2010]], the administrative divisions of the Maldives would consist of atolls, islands, and cities; each administered by their own [[local government|local council]], under the basic terms of [[home rule]]. Geographically, the [[Maldives]] are formed by a number of natural [[Atolls of the Maldives|atolls]] plus a few islands and isolated reefs which form a pattern from North to South. Administratively, there are currently 189 islands, 19 atolls and 2 cities in the [[Maldives]].

==Background==

===During the Gayyoom Regime===
During the regime of [[Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom]], the administrative divisions consisted of 20 administrative atolls, all controlled by the central government in [[Male']].

===Seven Provinces===
In 2008, in an attempt of [[decentralization]], the [[Mohamed Nasheed|Nasheed]] government divided the country into seven provinces. This maneuver was the first time that governing power has been moved away from the capital [[Male']] since [[Koimala of the Maldives|1117 A.D.]] However, the bill submitted by the government to decentralize the country according to this system was rejected by the opposition-majority [[Majlis of the Maldives|parliament]], who amended the bill, restricting decentralization as seven provinces. The final bill that was passed by the parliament and ultimately ratified by the president, saw the decentralization of the country as 21 constituencies.

The seven provinces were the following, followed by the atolls grouped within:

* [[Central Province, Maldives|Central Province]] (consisting of [[Dhaalu Atoll|Dhaalu]], [[Faafu Atoll|Faafu]] and [[Meemu Atoll|Meemu]] Atolls; capital: [[Kudahuvadhoo]])
* [[North Province, Maldives|North Province]] (consisting of [[Baa Atoll|Baa]], [[Lhaviyani Atoll|Lhaviyani]], [[Noonu Atoll|Noonu]] and [[Raa Atoll|Raa]] Atolls; capital: [[Felivaru]])
* [[North Central Province, Maldives|North Central Province]] (consisting of [[Alif Alif Atoll|Alif Alif]], [[Alif Dhaal Atoll|Alif Dhaal]], [[Kaafu Atoll|Kaafu]] and [[Vaavu Atoll|Vaavu]] Atolls, and [[MalÃ©]] City; capital: [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]])
* [[South Province, Maldives|South Province]] (consisting of [[Gnaviyani Atoll|Gnaviyani]] Atoll and [[Addu City|Addu]] City; capital: [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]])
* [[South Central Province, Maldives|South Central Province]] (consisting of [[Kolhumadulu|Thaa]] and [[Hadhdhunmathi|Laamu]] Atolls; capital: [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]])
* [[Upper North Province, Maldives|Upper North Province]] (consisting of [[Haa Alif Atoll|Haa Alif]], [[Haa Dhaalu Atoll|Haa Dhaalu]] and [[Shaviyani Atoll|Shaviyani]] Atolls; capital: [[Kulhudhuffushi]])
* [[Upper South Province, Maldives|Upper South Province]] (consisting of [[North Huvadhoo Atoll|Gaafu Alif]] and [[South Huvadhoo Atoll|Gaafu Dhaalu]] Atolls; capital: [[Thinadhoo (Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll)|Thinadhoo]])

The seven provinces closely correspond to the historic divisions of ''Uthuru Boduthiladhunmathi''. ''Dhekunu Boduthiladhunmathi'', ''Uthuru Medhu-Raajje'', ''Medhu-Raajje'', ''Dhekunu Medhu-Raajje'', ''Huvadhu'' (or ''Uthuru Suvadinmathi'') and ''Addumulah'' (or ''Dhekunu Suvadinmathi'').

===Decentralization===
On 15 October 2010, the government released a finalized list of the administrative constituencies established under the Decentralization Act. It listed 184 administrative constituencies. Out of these constituencies:
* 2 constituencies were declared "cities", as according to the criteria for determining cities in this act. These two constituencies were [[Maleâ]] and [[Seenu Atoll]]. After a referendum among the people, Seenu Atoll was renamed "Addu City".  Each city would be served by a city council.
* 181 constituencies were declared "islands", as according to the criteria for determining islands in this act. These islands are grouped together into 18 atolls. Each atoll shall be served by an atoll council, under which each island has its own island council.
* 1 constituency, [[Fuvahmulah]], was declared an "atoll", and was split into 8 wards at "island" constituency level. Each ward will have its own island council, who shall be governed by an atoll council. [[Fuvahmulah]] serves as the countryâs 19th atoll.

Therefore, the final organization of the administrative divisions are as below:
* 2 cities
* 189 islands
* 19 atolls

====National Offices====
Although the earlier provincial decentralization was rejected by Parliament, President [[Mohamed Nasheed|Nasheed]] reinstated the concept through "National Administrations". The National Administrations of Maldives were in the same divisions as the earlier provinces, and the previous province offices were reinstated as the office of that National Administration, to which the atoll councils reported to accordingly. The National Administrations acted as an extension of the central government in [[Maleâ]], for the convenience of dealing with regional affairs. The National Administrations operated under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
The seven National Administrations were:-
* Upper North National Administration
* North National Administration
* North Central National Administration
* Central National Administration
* South Central National Administration
* Upper South National Administration
* South National Administration

Each administration was headed by a state minister assigned by the [[President of Maldives|president]].

All 7 National Offices were abolished by the [[Mohamed Waheed Hassan|Waheed]] administration on 24 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/national_office/41612 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207162743/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/national_office/41612 |archivedate=7 December 2013 |df=dmy }} HaveeruOnline news article&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Council Election 2011===
On 5 February 2011, the country's first ever Local council elections were held to elect 188 island councils, 19 atoll councils and 2 city councils. 
The island of [[Felivaru]], in [[Lhaviyani Atoll]] did not participate in the election, since being a newly declared inhabited island, did not have any person registered as a citizen of the island. {{As of|2013|05}}, the island council election for [[Felivaru]] has yet to take place.

==Divisions==
The first-level divisions are cities and atolls.

===City===
A city is an inhabited area with a population of 25,000+. The criteria also includes a certain level of economic development and facilities available. A city has a "city council" which governs over the affairs of the city, and keeps communication with the central government. A city will not be included within an administrative atoll. A city has further subdivisions called "wards" or "districts". A city council will also govern over any uninhabited islands or resort islands within its designated area. 
There are two cities in Maldives. They are [[Maleâ]] and [[Addu City|Addu]].

===Atoll===
The administrative definition of an "atoll" differs from the actual meaning of the word '[[atoll]]'. While naturally, an "atoll" refers to a ring of islands, an "atoll" in the administrative sense, refers to a group of "island" class constituencies, not necessarily within the requirements of a natural atoll.  While the majority of administrative atolls are indeed natural atolls, there are exceptions. Each administrative atoll has an "atoll council" which monitors the work of the "island councils" in the atoll, and keep communications with the central government. An atoll council also governs all uninhabited islands and resort islands in their area. 
There are 19 atolls in Maldives.

===Island===
The administrative definition of an "island" differs from the actual meaning of the word '[[island]]'. While naturally, an "island" refers to a land-mass surrounded by water, an "island" in the administrative sense, refers to a specified inhabited area within an administrative atoll, which is governed over by an "island council". While the majority of "island" class constituencies are indeed natural islands, there are 8 constituencies at "island" class, that are not naturally islands. (The 8 wards of [[Fuvahmulah|Fuvahmulah Island]] are administratively considered "islands")
There are 189 such islands, each with its own island council. (Except for [[Felivaru]], [[Lhaviyani Atoll]])

==Codes and Names of the Administrative Divisions==
Every first-level administrative division of the Maldives have the following:

#An official name, for example '''Thiladhunmathi Uthuruburi''' (meaning Thiladhunmathi North). &lt;br&gt; This corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the Atoll. 
#A Maldivian code letter, for example: '''Haa Alifu'''. When there are two letters, the second stands either for '''"North"''' (Alifu) or for '''"South"''' (Dhaalu). &lt;br&gt; This code was adopted for convenience. It began in order to facilitate radio communication between the atolls and the central administration. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island: for example, Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.This code denomination has been very much misused by foreigners and tourists who do not understand the proper use of these names, and the true Maldivian names have often been ignored in publications for tourists. Maldivians may use the letter code name in colloquial conversation, but in serious geographic, historical or cultural writings, the true geographical name always takes precedence.

#A Latin code letter, for example: ('''A'''). &lt;br&gt; The Latin code letter is normally used in boat registration plates. The letter stands for the atoll and the number for the island.

Each atoll has a capital island. All islands of every atoll have their own official name. 
All cities have an official name, and names for their subdivisions. They also have a Latin code letter assigned to them.

Traditionally, Maldivians call the atolls ending in '-madulu' or '-mathi' by their name without adding the word 'Atoll' at the end. For example, it is correct to write simply [[Kolhumadulu Atoll|Kolhumadulu]], without adding the word 'Atholhu' or 'Atoll'. This is also the case in the atoll known as [[Faadhippolhu Atoll|Faadhippolhu]] as well as the small detached atoll of [[Fuvahmulah]].

'''Albert Peter Low''' (May 24, 1861 â October 9, 1942) was a Canadian [[geologist]], explorer and athlete. His explorations of 1893â1895 were important in declaring Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic, and eventually defining the border between [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]].

He was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=LOW, Albert Peter|magazine=[[Canadian Who's Who]]|year=1910|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0MzAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[McGill University]], graduating in 1882. He moved to [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] to work as a surveyor and explorer with the Geological Survey of Canada. Low was recognized by senior officials for his excellent work and handed a series of scientific assignments in the North. Although his career is dotted with distinguished work, Low is perhaps best remembered as the commander of a 1903-04 Dominion expedition to declare Canada's authority over the Arctic, a journey that resulted in a bestselling book, ''The Cruise of the Neptune''. In 1906, he was appointed director of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]]. In 1907, he became the first deputy minister of the [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Mines]]. He retired from the department in 1913. He died in [[Ottawa]] in 1942.

Low was also an athlete, and he played [[ice hockey]] for two famous teams, the [[McGill Redmen|McGill University Hockey Club]], considered the first organized hockey club in the world, and the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]]. In 1883, he played [[goaltender]] for the victorious McGill Hockey Club in the 1883 Montreal Winter Carnival. The championship is considered the first Canadian championship. After moving to Ottawa in 1883, he was a founding member of the Ottawa Hockey Club, formed within weeks of the 1883 tournament. In 1884, he would return to the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Montreal Winter Carnival tournament]] as Ottawa's goaltender and [[shutout]] McGill. He was a member of the Ottawa Hockey Club until 1889.

[[Aplowite]], which is a transparent, pink-coloured cobalt mineral, is named in his honour.

[[File:white cliffs of dover 09 2004.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|The [[White Cliffs of Dover]] may have given rise to the name ''Albion''.]]
'''Albion''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|Ã¦|l|b|i|Én}}) is the oldest known name of the island of [[Great Britain]].  Today, it is still sometimes used poetically to refer to the island. The name for [[Scotland]] in the Celtic languages is related to Albion: ''[[Alba]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], ''Albain'' (genitive ''Alban'') in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''Nalbin'' in [[Manx language|Manx]] and ''Alban'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]. These names were later [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] as ''Albania'' and [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as ''Albany'', which were once alternative names for Scotland.

''New Albion'' and ''Albionoria'' ("Albion of the North") were briefly suggested as [[name of Canada|names of Canada]] during the period of the [[Canadian Confederation]].&lt;ref name="other"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaonline.about.com/od/history/a/namecanada.htm|title=How Canada Got Its Name|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207073242/http://canadaonline.about.com/od/history/a/namecanada.htm|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Alan|title=Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&amp;pg=PA16|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Phillip]], first leader of the colonisation of Australia, originally named [[Sydney Cove]] "New Albion", but later the colony acquired the name "[[Sydney]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Miles (2001) ''Who Cooked the Last Supper: The Women's History of the World'' Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-609-80695-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6vPOD6Ol15MC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manly.nsw.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/council/about-manly/manly-heritage--history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512034452/http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/council/about-manly/manly-heritage--history/ |archivedate=2016-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/letters/phillip/index.html|title=Stories|first=scheme=AGLSTERMS.AglsAgent; corporateName=State Library of New South Wales; address=Macquarie Street, Sydney, NSW 2000; contact=+61 2 9273|last=1414|date=10 September 2015|website=State Library of NSW|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203035645/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/letters/phillip/index.html|archivedate=2013-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Common Brittonic]] name for the island, [[Hellenised]] as ''AlbÃ­Ån'' ({{lang|grc|á¼Î»Î²Î¯ÏÎ½}})&lt;!--á¼Î»Î²Î¹ÏÎ½ only in later sources--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Greek]] "... á¼Î½ ÏÎ¿ÏÏá¿³ Î³Îµ Î¼á½´Î½ Î½á¿ÏÎ¿Î¹ Î¼Î­Î³Î¹ÏÏÎ¿Î¹ ÏÏÎ³ÏÎ¬Î½Î¿ÏÏÎ¹Î½ Î¿á½ÏÎ±Î¹ Î´ÏÎ¿, ÎÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¹ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î»ÎµÎ³ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î±Î¹, á¼Î»Î²Î¯ÏÎ½ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼¸Î­ÏÎ½Î·, ...", transliteration "... en toutÃ´i ge mÃªn nÃªsoi megistoi tynchanousin ousai dyo, Brettanikai legomenai, AlbiÃ´n kai IernÃª, ...", ''Aristotle: On Sophistical Refutations.

On the Cosmos.'', 393b, pages 360â361, Loeb Classical Library No. 400, London William Heinemann LTD, Cambridge, Massachusetts University Press MCMLV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] as ''AlbiÅn'' ([[genitive case|genitive]] ''Albionis''), derives from the [[Proto-Celtic language#Nasal stems|Proto-Celtic nasal stem]] ''*AlbiÌ¯iÅ«'' ([[Oblique case|oblique]] ''*Albiion-'') and survived in [[Old Irish]] as ''Albu'' ([[genitive case|genitive]] ''Albann''). The name originally referred to Britain as a whole, but was later restricted to [[Caledonia]] (giving the modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] name for Scotland, [[Alba]]). The root ''*albiio-'' is also found in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Galatian language|Galatian]] ''albio-'' ("world") and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''elfydd'' ({{lang|owl|elbid}}, "earth, world, land, country, district"). It may be related to other European and Mediterranean [[toponymy|toponyms]] such as ''[[Alps|Alpes]]'', and ''[[Albania]]''. It has two possible etymologies. It may derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*albho-'', meaning "white" (cf. Latin ''albus''). This is perhaps in reference to the white southern shores of the island, though Celtic linguist [[:fr:Xavier Delamarre|Xavier Delamarre]] argued that it originally meant "the world above, the visible world", in opposition to "the world below", i.e., the underworld. Alternatively it may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*alb-'', meaning "hill".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Philip, Koch, John T., in: Koch, John T. (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, pp. 38â39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Errance, 2003 (2nd ed.), pp. 37â38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekwall, Eilert  "Early names of Britain", in: ''Antiquity'', Vol. 4, #14, 1930, pp. 149â156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from [[Avienus]]'s ''Ora Maritima'' to which it is considered to have served as a source, the ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'' (originally written in the 6th century BC, translated by [[Avienus]] at the end of the 4th century), does not use the name ''Britannia''; instead it speaks of ''nÄsos IernÅn kai AlbiÅnÅn'' "the islands of the Iernians and the Albiones".&lt;ref&gt;[[Avienus]]' ''Ora Maritima'', verses 111-112, i.e. ''eamque late gens Hiernorum colit; propinqua rursus insula Albionum patet''.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Pytheas]] (ca. 320 BC), as directly or indirectly quoted in the surviving excerpts of his works in later writers, speaks of ''AlbiÅn and IernÄ'' (Britain and Ireland). Pytheas's grasp of the {{lang|grc|Î½á¿ÏÎ¿Ï Î ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¹ÎºÎ®}} (''nÄsos PrettanikÄ'', "Prettanic island") is somewhat blurry, and appears to include anything he considers a western island, including ''[[Thule]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G.

By the 1st century AD, the name refers unequivocally to Great Britain. But this "enigmatic name for Britain, revived much later by Romantic poets like William Blake, did not remain popular among Greek writers. It was soon replaced by {{lang|grc|Î ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¯Î±}} (''PrettanÃ­a'') and {{lang|grc|ÎÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¯Î±}} (''BrettanÃ­a'' "Britain"), {{lang|grc|ÎÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½ÏÏ}} (''BrettanÃ³s'' "Briton"), and {{lang|grc|ÎÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ}} (''BrettanikÃ³s'', meaning the adjective British).

A legend exists in various forms that giants were either the original inhabitants, or the founders of the land named Albion.

===Geoffrey of Monmouth===
According to the 12th-century ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' ("The History of The Kings of Britain") by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], the exiled [[Brutus of Troy]] was told by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]];
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Brutus! there lies beyond the Gallic bounds
An island which the western sea surrounds,
By giants once possessed, now few remain
To bar thy entrance, or obstruct thy reign.

There fate decrees to raise a second Troy
And found an empire in thy royal line,
Which time shall ne'er destroy, nor bounds confine.&lt;/poem&gt;|Geoffrey of Monmouth|[[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1#11|History of the Kings of Britain/Books 1, 11]]}}

After many adventures, Brutus and his fellow [[Troy|Trojans]] escape from [[Gaul]] and "set sail with a fair wind towards the promised island".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1#15|History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1, 15]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The island was then called Albion, and inhabited by none but a few giants. Notwithstanding this, the pleasant situation of the places, the plenty of rivers abounding with fish, and the engaging prospect of its woods, made Brutus and his company very desirous to fix their habitation in it." After dividing up the island between themselves "at last Brutus called the island after his own name Britain, and his companions Britons; for by these means he desired to perpetuate the memory of his name".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1#16|History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1, 16]]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey goes on to recount how the last of the giants are defeated, the largest one called [[Gogmagog (folklore)|GoÃ«magot]] is flung over a cliff by [[Corineus]].

==={{anchor|Des grantz geanz}}Anglo-Norman Albina story===
Later, in the 14th century, a more elaborate tale was developed, claiming that Albina and her sisters founded Albion and procreated there a race of giants.&lt;ref name="brenau"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernau|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Albina story" survives in several forms, including the  [[octosyllable|octosyllabic]] Anglo-Norman poem "Des grantz geanz" dating to 1300&amp;mdash;1334&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brereton|1937|p=xxxii}} had allowed for earlier dating range, giving 1200 (more likely 1250) to 1333/4: "not earlier than the beginning &amp;mdash; probably not before the middle &amp;mdash; of the thirteenth century and not later than 1333&amp;ndash;4"&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Georgine Elizabeth Brereton]] ed. 1937;&lt;ref name="brereton"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brereton|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Achille Jubinal|Jubinal]] ed., "Des graunz Jaianz ki primes conquistrent Bretaingne" (1842)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jubinal|1842|pp=354&amp;ndash;371}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The same text (same MS source) as Jubinal (Cotton Cleopatra IX) occurs in [[Francisque Michel]] ed., ''Gesta Regum Britanniae'' (1862), under the Latin title ''De Primis Inhabitatoribus AngliÃ¦'' and incipit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michel|1862|pp=199&amp;ndash;254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}). A prose English translation is given in [[Richard Barber]]'s anthology (1999).&lt;ref name="barber"/&gt; According to the poem, in the 3970th [[Anno Mundi|year of the creation of the world]],&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brereton|1937|p=2}}, "Del mound, treis mil e nef cent/E sessante e diz ans" ll.14-15; but "treis" is lacking in {{Harvnb|Michel|1862}} so that it reads "1970 years"&lt;/ref&gt; a king of Greece married his thirty daughters into royalty, but the haughty brides colluded to eliminate their husbands so they would be subservient to no one.  The youngest would not be party to the crime and divulged the plot, so the other princesses were confined to an unsteerable rudderless ship and set adrift, and after three days reached an uninhabited land later to be known as "England". The eldest daughter Albina ({{lang|xno|Albine}}) was the first to set shore and lay claim to the land, naming it after herself. At first, the women gathered acorns and fruits, but once they learned to hunt and obtain meat, it aroused their lecherous desires. As no other humans inhabited the land, they mated with evil spirits called "'[[incubus|incubi]]", and subsequently with the sons they begot, engendering a race of giants. These giants are evidenced by huge bones which are unearthed. Brutus arrived 260 years after Albina, 1136 before the birth of Christ, but by then there were only 24 giants left, due to inner strife.&lt;ref name="barber"/&gt; As with Geoffrey of Monmouth's version, Brutus's band subsequently overtake the land, defeating [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]] in the process.&lt;ref name="barber"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manuscripts and forms====
The octosyllabic poem appears as a prologue to 16 out of 26 manuscripts of the Short Version of the Anglo-Norman prose ''Brut'', which derives from [[Wace]]. Octosyllabic is not the only form the Anglo-Norman ''Des Grantz Geanz'', there are five forms, the others being: the [[alexandrine]], prose, short verse, and short prose versions.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{citation|last=Dean|first=Ruth|title=Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts|year=1999|pages=26â30}}, cited by {{cite thesis|last=Fisher|first=Matthew|title=Once Called Albion: The Composition and Transmission of History Writing in England, 1280-1350|publisher=Oxford University|year=2004|url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3A5b5c77fa-2308-4eda-936a-a39478de1b66/datastreams/ATTACHMENT1|page=25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309072443/http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3A5b5c77fa-2308-4eda-936a-a39478de1b66/datastreams/ATTACHMENT1|archivedate=2014-03-09|df=}}.

===Diocletian's daughters===
A variant tale occurs in the [[Middle English]] prose ''Brut'' (Brie ed., ''The Brut or the Chronicles of England'' 1906â1908) of the 14th century, an English rendition of the Anglo-Norman ''Brut'' deriving from [[Wace]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;In the Anglo-Norman prose ''Brut'', the poem prefaced to the Short Version was incorporated to the text proper (prologue) of the Long Version, from the long version. This long version was then rendered into Middle English.{{Harvnb|Lamont|2007|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brie"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brie|1906â1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernau|2007|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Prolog of this chronicle, it was King "Dioclician" of "Surrey" (Syria&lt;ref name="baswell"/&gt;), who had 33 daughters, the eldest being called "Albyne". The princesses are all banished to Albion after plotting to murder their husbands, where they couple with the local demons; their offspring became a race of giants. The chronicle asserts that during the voyage Albyne entrusted the fate of the sisters to "Appolyn," which was the god of their faith. The Syrian king who was her father sounds much like a Roman emperor,&lt;ref name="baswell"&gt;{{citation|last=Baswell|first=Christopher|title=English Literature and the Classical Past|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Peter|work=A Companion To Medieval English Literature and Culture C.1350 - C.1500|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A45BRUIiH5gC&amp;pg=PA113|pages=242â243|isbn=1405195525}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Diocletian]] (3rd century) would be anachronistic, and Holinshed &lt;ref&gt;''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|Historie of England]]'' 1587, Book 1, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; explains this as a bungling of the legend of [[Danaus]] and his fifty daughters who founded [[Argos]].

===Later treatment of the myth===
Because Geoffrey of Monmouth's work was regarded as fact until the late 17th century, the story appears in most early histories of Britain. [[Wace]], [[Layamon]], [[Raphael Holinshed]], [[William Camden]] and [[John Milton]] repeat the legend and it appears in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Carrie Anne (1964), ''The Sources of The British Chronicle History in Spenser's Faerie Queene'', Haskell House, pp. 48â49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blake]]'s poems ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'' feature Albion as an archetypal giant representing humanity.

In 2010, artist [[Mark Sheeky]] donated the 2008 painting "Two [[Roman Legionaries]] Discovering The God-King Albion Turned Into Stone" to the [[Grosvenor Museum]] collection.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheshire-today.co.uk/9652/chester-grosvenor-art-competition-winners/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020173315/http://www.cheshire-today.co.uk/9652/chester-grosvenor-art-competition-winners/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 October 2016|title=Chester Grosvenor Art competition: winners|publisher=[[Cheshire Today]]|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Samoa Department of Education''' ('''ASDOE''') operates public schools in [[American Samoa]], an [[insular area]] of the [[United States]]. The public primary schools of the Eastern District includes the following: Matafao Elementary, Aua Elementary, Pago Elementary, Masefau Elementary, and etc. The public primary schools of the Western District includes the following: Alataua Elementary, Leone Midkiff Elementary, Pavaiai Elementary, Lupelele Elementary, Manulele Tausala Elementary, and Tafuna Elementary. On the secondary level, these schools are the 5 largest high schools in time order: Samoana High School (1946), Leone High School (1965), Fagaitua High School (1968), Nuâuli Vo-Tech High School (1982), and Tafuna High School (1982). Samoana High School is the first secondary school of the territory, and at the time it was simply called American Samoa High School. However, when other new high schools were established, it was renamed Samoana. Samoana High today is the second largest high school in terms of student population (946) and the third largest high school in terms of area (295,000 sq. Ft.). Leone High School is the first Western District High School. Faced with a shrinking student population, Leone High today ranks 3rd in terms of student population (675) and is the second largest high school in terms of area (353,000 sq. Ft.). Fagaitua High School is the first Eastern District High School. It is the 4th largest high school in terms of student enrollment (537) and the 4th largest high school in terms of area (117,000 sq. Ft.). Nuâuli Vo-Tech High School is the first trade-school in the territory. Because of this, it has the smallest student enrollment (265). It is also the smallest out of the big 5 in terms of area (100,000 sq. Ft.). Tafuna High School is the newest public high school in the territory. It has grown to have the largest student enrollment (1202) and boast the largest school size (527,000 sq. Ft.) Each high school, except Nuâuli Vo-Tech, are given unique nicknames entitled to their specific color/ reputation: Samoana Sharks âBlue Empireâ, Leone Lions âLion Kingdomâ, Fagaitua Vikings âFunky Townâ, and Tafuna Warriors âWarrior Nation.â

==Membership==

ASPRS members-individuals from private industry, the [[government]], and [[academia]] are analysts/specialists, [[educator]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Management|managers]]/[[Administration (business)|administrator]]s, [[manufacturer]]s/product developers, operators, technicians, trainees, marketers, and [[scientist]]s/[[researcher]]s. Employed in the disciplines of the mapping sciences, members work in the fields of [[Agriculture]]/Soils, [[Archeology]], [[Biology]], [[Cartography]], [[Ecology]], [[Natural environment|Environment]], [[Forestry]]/Range, [[Geodesy]], [[Geography]], [[Geology]], [[Hydrology]]/water Resources, [[Land Appraisal]]/[[Real Estate]], [[Medicine]], [[Transportation]], and [[Urban Planning]]/Development.

==Divisions==
ASPRS has six professional divisions.  They are the LiDAR Division, Remote Sensing Applications Division, Professional Practice Division, Primary Data Acquisition Division, Photogrammetric Applications Division and the GIS Division.  Coming soon will be a UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Division.  Each division has two elected officers, the Director and the Assistant Director.  Division meetings are held at the ASPRS National conferences are attendance is open to all members.

==ASPRS Accuracy Standards==
On March 2, 2015 ASPRS released the new Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asprs.org/Standards-Activities.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The new ASPRS standards address recent innovations in digital imaging and non-imaging sensors, airborne GPS, inertial measurement units (IMU) and aerial triangulation (AT) technologies. Unlike prior standards, the new standards are independent of scale and contour interval, they address higher levels of accuracies achievable by the latest technologies (e.g. unmanned aerial systems and lidar mobile mapping systems), and they provide enough flexibility to be applicable to future technologies as they are developed. Finally, the new standards provide cross references to older standards, as well as detailed guidance for a wide range of potential applications."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The new standards incorporate the USGS LiDAR Base Specifications v. 1.2 released in November 2014 and are a part of the soon to be released new USACE Manual of Photogrammetry.

{{Platonism}}
The '''analogy of the sun''' (or '''simile of  the sun''' or '''metaphor of the sun''') is found in the sixth book of ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (507bâ509c), written by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] as a dialogue between [[Glaucon]] (Plato's elder brother) and [[Socrates]] (narrated by the latter). Upon being urged by Glaucon to define goodness, a cautious Socrates professes himself incapable of doing so.&lt;ref name=Pojman&gt;{{cite book|last=Pojman|first=Louis|last2=Vaughn|first2=L.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Classics of Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}}  Instead he draws an analogy and offers to talk about "the child of goodness"&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|169}} ({{lang-grc-gre|"á¼ÎºÎ³Î¿Î½ÏÏ ÏÎµ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼Î³Î±Î¸Î¿á¿¦"}}). Socrates reveals this "child of goodness" to be the sun, proposing that just as the sun illuminates, bestowing the ability to see and be seen by the eye,&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|169}} with its light so the [[Form of the Good|idea of goodness]] illumines the intelligible with truth. While the analogy sets forth both [[epistemology|epistemological]] and [[ontology|ontological]] theories, it is debated whether these are most authentic to the teaching of Socrates or its later interpretations by Plato. The sun is a metaphor for the nature of reality and knowledge concerning it.

Plato's use of such an analogy can be interpreted for many different reasons in philosophy. For example, Plato uses them to illustrate and help illuminate his arguments. In the Analogy of the Sun, Socrates compares the "Good" with the sun. Plato might be using the image of the sun to help bring life to his arguments or to make the argument more clearly understood. David Hume once wrote, "All our reasonings concerning matters of fact are founded on a species of Analogy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fosl, Peter S.|author2=Baggini, Julian|year=2010|title=The Philosophers Toolkit|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato makes the claim that "sight and the visible realm are deficient."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|170}} He argues that for the other senses to be used all that is needed is the sense itself and that which can be sensed by it (e.g., to taste sweetness, one needs the sense of taste and that which can be tasted as sweet), but "even if a person's eyes are capable of sight, and he's trying to use it, and what he's trying to look at is coloured, the sight will see nothing and the colours will remain unseen, surely, unless there is also present an extra third thing which is made specifically for this purpose."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|170}} The third thing Plato is talking about is light. Through this analogy he equates that which gives us natural light, the sun, as the source of goodness in this world.

:"As goodness stands in the intelligible realm to intelligence and the things we know, so in the visible realm the sun stands to sight and the things we see."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

In other words, Plato is saying that the true nature of reality cannot be comprehended by the ordinary senses. Thus, we should make use of the mind rather than the sensory organs to better understand the higher truths of the universe. The mind, much like sight, requires a "third thing" to function properly, and that third thing is Plato's idea of goodness. He likens a mind without goodness to sight without light; one cannot operate at peak efficiency without the other.

:"Well, here's how you can think about the mind as well. When its object is something which is lit up by truth and reality, then it hasâand obviously hasâintelligent awareness and knowledge. However, when its object is permeated with darkness (that is, when its object is something which is subject to generation and decay), then it has beliefs and is less effective, because its beliefs chop and change, and under these circumstances it comes across as devoid of intelligence."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Having made these claims, Socrates asks Glaucon, "...which of the gods in heaven can you put down as cause and master of this, whose light makes our sight see so beautifully and the things to be seen?" (508a) Glaucon responds that both he and all others would answer that this is the [[sun]]. Analogously, Socrates says, as the sun illuminates the visible with light so the idea of goodness illuminates the intelligible with truth, which in turn makes it possible for people to have knowledge. Also, as the eye's ability to see is made possible by the light of the sun so the soul's ability to know is made possible by the truth of goodness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understand then, that it is the same with the soul, thus: when it settles itself firmly in that region in which truth and real being brightly shine, it understands and knows it and appears to have reason; but when it has nothing to rest on but that which is mingled with darknessâthat which becomes and perishes, it opines, it grows dim-sighted, changing opinions up and down, and is like something without reason. ('The Republic, VI: 508d; trans. [[W. H. D. Rouse]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The allusion to "...that which becomes and perishes..." relates to all of that which is perceived by the bodily senses. The bodily senses make it clear that all visible things are subject to change, which Socrates categorizes into either the change of becoming or the change of perishing. Socrates argues that the bodily senses can only bring us to opinions, conveying an underlying assumption that true knowledge is of that which is not subject to change.

Instead, Socrates continues, knowledge is to be found in  "... that region in which truth and real being brightly shine..." (508d) This is the intelligible illuminated by the highest idea, that of goodness.  Since truth and being find their source in this highest idea, only the souls that are illumined by this source can be said to possess knowledge, whereas those souls which turn away are "...mingled with darkness...".  This subject is later vividly illustrated in the [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Allegory of the Cave]] (514aâ520a), where prisoners bound in a dark cave since childhood are examples of these souls turned away from illumination.

Socrates continues by explaining that though light and sight both resemble the sun neither can identify themselves with the sun. Just as the sun is rated higher than both light and sight, so is goodness rated more highly than knowledge and truth. It is goodness which allows us to know the truth and makes it possible to have knowledge. Hence goodness is more valuable than truth and knowledge as it holds a higher place. Through this analogy, Socrates helped Glaucon come to the realization that Goodness is of inestimable value, being both the source of knowledge and truth, as well as more valuable and unattainable than both.&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Plato further equates the sun to the ultimate form of goodness by calling them both sources of "generation".&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}} The sun not only makes objects visible but is necessary for their growth and nourishment, similarly to how goodness not only makes it possible for things to be, but also allows for things to be known.

:The sun provides not only the power of being seen for things seen, but, as I think you will agree, also their generation and growth and nurture, although it is not itself generation...Similarly with things known, you will agree that the good is not only the cause of their becoming known, but the cause that they are, the cause of their state of being, although the good is not itself a state of being but something transcending far beyond it in dignity and power.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic VI (509b); trans. W. H. D. Rouse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates' main concern was that he did not want his followers to place Goodness, Knowledge, and Truth all on the same level. You can achieve Goodness from Truth and Knowledge, but just because you have Truth and Knowledge that does not mean you have Goodness. Plato writes:
 
:Well, what I'm saying is that it's goodness which gives the things we know their truth and makes it possible for people to have knowledge. It is responsible for knowledge and truth, you should think of it as being within the intelligible realm, but you shouldn't identify it with knowledge and truth, otherwise you'll be wrong: For all their value, it is even more valuable. In the other realm, it is right to regard light and sight as resembling the sun; So in this realm it is right to regard knowledge and truth as resembling goodness, but not to identify either of them with goodness, which should be rated even more highly.&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Ultimately, the Good itself is the whole point. The Good (the sun) provides the very foundation on which all other truth rests. Plato uses the image of the sun to help define the true meaning of the Good. The Good "sheds light" on knowledge so that our minds can see true reality. Without the Good, we would only be able to see with our physical eyes and not the "mind's eye". The sun bequeaths its light so that we may see the world around us. If the source of light did not exist we would be in the dark and incapable of learning and understanding the true realities that surround us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marmysz, John|title=The Path of Philosophy|location=Wadsworth|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidentally, the metaphor of the sun exemplifies a traditional interrelation between [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]: interpretations of fundamental existence createâand are created byâways of knowing. It also neatly sums up two views for which Plato is recognized: his [[rationalism]] and his [[Platonic realism|realism]] (about universals).

Socrates, using the Simile of the Sun as a foundation, continues with the [[Analogy of the Divided Line]] (509dâ513e) after which follows the [[Allegory of the Cave]] (514aâ520a).

===Afterlife beliefs and Cult of the Dead===
Canaanites believed that following physical death, the ''npÅ¡'' (usually translated as "[[soul]]") departed from the body to the land of [[Mot (god)|Mot]] (Death). Bodies were buried with [[grave goods]], and offerings of food and drink were made to the dead to ensure that they would not trouble the living. Dead relatives were venerated and sometimes asked for help.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Alan F. ''Life after death: a history of the afterlife in the religions of the West''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annettereed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annettereed.com/RS-3R03/reed3R03_1-10.pdf |format=PDF |date=11 February 2005 |title=Life, Death, and Afterlife in Ancient Israel and Canaan |author=Annette Reed |accessdate=2014-10-01 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
None of the inscribed tablets found in 1929 in the Canaanite city of [[Ugarit]] (destroyed c. 1200&amp;nbsp;BC) has revealed a [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]]. Any idea of one is often reconstructed from the much later Phoenician text by [[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64â141&amp;nbsp;AD), after much Greek and Roman influence in the region.

According to the pantheon, known in Ugarit as 'ilhm ([[Elohim]]) or the children of [[El (deity)|El]], supposedly obtained by Philo of Byblos from [[Sanchuniathon]] of Berythus ([[Beirut]]) the creator was known as Elion, who was the father of the divinities, and in the Greek sources he was married to Beruth (Beirut = the city). This marriage of the divinity with the city would seem to have Biblical parallels too with the stories of the link between [[Melqart]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]; [[Chemosh]] and [[Moab]]; [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]] in [[Carthage]], [[Jah|Yah]] and [[Jerusalem]].

From the union of El Elyon and his consort were born Uranus and Ge, Greek names for the "Heaven" and the "Earth".

In Canaanite mythology there were twin mountains Targhizizi and Tharumagi which hold the firmament up above the earth-circling ocean, thereby bounding the earth. W. F. Albright, for example, says that [[El Shaddai]] is a derivation of a Semitic stem that appears in the Akkadian ''shadÃ»'' ("mountain") and ''shaddÄ`Ã»'' or ''shaddÃ»`a'' ("mountain-dweller"), one of the names of Amurru. Philo of Byblos states that Atlas was one of the Elohim, which would clearly fit into the story of El Shaddai as "God of the Mountain(s)."  Harriet Lutzky has presented evidence that Shaddai was an attribute of a Semitic goddess, linking the epithet with Hebrew ''Å¡ad'' "breast" as "the one of the Breast". The idea of two mountains being associated here as the breasts of the Earth, fits into the Canaanite mythology quite well. The ideas of pairs of mountains seem to be quite common in Canaanite mythology (similar to Horeb and Sinai in the Bible). The late period of this cosmology makes it difficult to tell what influences (Roman, Greek, or Hebrew) may have informed Philo's writings.

===Mythology===
In the [[Baal Cycle]], Ba'al Hadad is challenged by and defeats Yam, using two magical weapons (called "Driver" and "Chaser") made for him by Kothar-wa-Khasis. Afterward, with the help of Athirat and Anat, Ba'al persuades El to allow him a palace. El approves, and the palace is built by Kothar-wa-Khasis. After the palace is constructed, Ba'al gives forth a thunderous roar out of the palace window and challenges Mot. Mot enters through the window and swallows Ba'al, sending him to the Underworld. With no one to give rain, there is a terrible drought in Ba'al's absence. The other deities, especially El and Anat, are distraught that Ba'al has been taken to the Underworld. Anat goes to the Underworld, attacks Mot with a knife, grinds him up into pieces, and scatters him far and wide. With Mot defeated, Ba'al is able to return and refresh the Earth with rain.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Philip ''Myths &amp; Legends: An Illustrated Guide to Their Origins and Meanings''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious practices===
Archaeological investigations at the site of [[Tell el-Safiad]] have found the remains of donkeys, as well as some sheep and goats in Early Bronze Age layers, dating to 4,900 years ago which were imported from Egypt in order to be sacrificed. One of the sacrificial animals, a complete donkey, was found beneath the foundations of a building, leading to speculation this was a 'foundation deposit' placed before the building of a residential house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/1.726027|title=Canaanites Imported Sacrificial Animals From Egypt, Archaeologists Find|first=Philippe|last=Bohstrom|date=21 June 2016|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered virtually impossible to reconstruct a clear picture of Canaanite religious practices. Although child sacrifice was known to surrounding peoples there is no reference to it in ancient Phoenician or Classical texts.  The biblical representation of Canaanite religion is always negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |authors=David Noel Freedman, Allen C. Myers |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |date=2000-12-31 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canaanite religious practice had a high regard for the duty of children to care for their parents, with sons being held responsible for burying them, and arranging for the maintenance of their tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction |authors=Lawrence Boadt, Richard J. Clifford, Daniel J. Harrington |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2012 |chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canaanite deities such as Baal were represented by figures which were placed in shrines often on hilltops, or 'high places' surrounded by groves of trees, such as is condemned in the Hebrew Bible, in Hosea (v 13a) which would probably hold the Asherah pole, and standing stones or pillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hosea, Joel, and Amos |author=Bruce C. Birch |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=1997-01-01 |pages=33, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Canaanites===
The Levant region was inhabited by people who themselves referred to the land as 'ca-na-na-um' as early as the mid-third millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Aubet, Maria E., 1987, 910 ''The Phoenicians and the West'', (Cambridge University Press, New York) p.9&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of possible [[etymology|etymologies]] for the word.

The Akkadian word "''kinahhu''" referred to the purple-colored wool, dyed from the ''[[Murex]]'' molluscs of the coast, which was throughout history a key export of the region. When the Greeks later traded with the Canaanites, this meaning of the word seems to have predominated as they called the Canaanites the Phoenikes or "Phoenicians", which may derive from the Greek word "''Phoenix''" meaning crimson or purple, and again described the cloth for which the Greeks also traded. The Romans transcribed "''phoenix''" to "''poenus''", thus calling the descendants of the Canaanite settlers in Carthage "''Punic''".

Thus while "''Phoenician''" and "''Canaanite''" refer to the same culture, archaeologists and historians commonly refer to the [[Bronze Age]], pre-1200&amp;nbsp;BC Levantines as Canaanites; and their [[Iron Age]] descendants, particularly those living on the coast, as Phoenicians. More recently, the term Canaanite has been used for the secondary Iron Age states of the interior (including the [[Philistines]] and the states of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Philip R.|authorlink=Philip R.

===Influences===
Canaanite religion was strongly influenced by their more powerful and populous neighbors, and shows clear influence of [[Mesopotamia]]n  and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religious practices. Like other people of the Ancient Near East Canaanite religious beliefs were [[polytheism|polytheistic]], with families typically focusing on [[veneration of the dead]] in the form of household gods and goddesses, the [[Elohim#Canaanite religion|Elohim]], while acknowledging the existence of other deities such as [[Baal]] and [[El (deity)|El]], Asherah and Astarte. Kings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the ''[[hieros gamos]]'' of the [[New Year]], may have been revered as gods. "At the center of Canaanite religion was royal concern for religious and political legitimacy and the imposition of a divinely ordained legal structure, as well as peasant emphasis on fertility of the crops, flocks, and humans."&lt;ref&gt;abstract, K. L. Noll (2007) "Canaanite Religion", ''Religion Compass'' 1 (1), 61â92 {{doi|10.1111/j.1749-8171.2006.00010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moscati, Sabatino.

Canaanite religion was influenced by its peripheral position, intermediary between Egypt and Mesopotamia, whose religions had a growing impact upon Canaanite religion. For example, during the [[Hyksos]] period, when chariot-mounted ''[[maryannu]]'' ruled in Egypt, at their capital city of [[Avaris]], Baal became associated with the Egyptian god [[Set (deity)|Set]], and was considered identical â particularly with Set in his form as Sutekh. Iconographically henceforth Baal was shown wearing the crown of [[Lower Egypt]] and shown in the Egyptian-like stance, one foot set before the other. Similarly [[Asherah|Athirat]] (known by her later Hebrew name Asherah), [[Astarte|Athtart]] (known by her later Greek name Astarte), and [[Anat]] henceforth were portrayed wearing [[Hathor]]-like Egyptian wigs.

From the other direction, [[Jean BottÃ©ro]] has suggested that [[Jah|Yah]] of [[Ebla]] (a possible precursor of [[Yam (god)|Yam]]) was equated with the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] god [[Enki|Ea]] during the [[Akkadian Empire]]. In the Middle and Late Bronze Age, there are also strong [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] and [[Mitanni]]te influences upon the Canaanite religion. The Hurrian goddess [[Hebat]] was worshiped in [[Jerusalem]], and [[Baal]] was closely considered equivalent to  the Hurrian storm god [[Teshub]] and the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] storm god, [[Teshub|Tarhunt]]. Canaanite divinities seem to have been almost identical in form and function to the neighboring [[Arameans]] to the east, and Baal [[Hadad]] and El can be distinguished amongst earlier [[Amorites]], who at the end of the Early [[Bronze Age]] invaded [[Mesopotamia]].

Carried west by [[Phoenicia]]n sailors, Canaanite religious influences can be seen in [[Greek mythology]], particularly in the tripartite division between the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], mirroring the division between [[Baal]], [[Yam (god)|Yam]] and [[Mot (god)|Mot]], and in the story of the [[Labours of Hercules]], mirroring the stories of the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] Melqart, who was often equated with Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1611641624 |title=Stories from Ancient Canaan, Second Edition |isbn=1611641624 |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Present-day knowledge of Canaanite religion comes from:

Schaefer]] began excavating in 1929 at Ras Shamra in Northern [[Syria]] (the site historically known as [[Ugarit]]), and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of [[clay tablet]]s written in an [[cuneiform script|alphabetical cuneiform]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Schaeffer |first= Claude F.

[[Papyrus]] seems to have been the preferred writing medium, but whereas in Egypt papyrus may survive centuries in the extremely dry climate, Canaanite records have simply decayed in the humid [[Mediterranean climate]].&lt;ref name="OlmoLete"&gt;Olmo Lete, Gregorio del (1999), "Canaanite religion: According to the liturgical texts of Ugarit" (CDL)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the accounts contained within the [[Bible]] represented almost the only sources of information on ancient Canaanite religion. This record was supplemented by a few secondary and tertiary Greek sources: ([[Lucian]]'s ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' (The Syrian Goddess), fragments of the ''Phoenician History'' of [[Philo of Byblos]] (died 141 CE), and the writings of [[Damascius]]). More recently, detailed study of the Ugaritic material, of other inscriptions from the Levant and also of the [[Ebla]] archive from Tel Mardikh, excavated in 1960 by a joint Italo-Syrian team, have cast more light on the early Canaanite religion.&lt;ref name="OlmoLete"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillers D.R. (1985)"Analyzing the Abominable: Our Understanding of Canaanite Religion" (The Jewish quarterly review, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', the Ugarit texts represent one part of a larger religion that was based on the religious teachings of Babylon. The Canaanite scribes who produced the ''Baal'' texts were also trained to write in Babylonian cuneiform, including Sumerian and Akkadian texts of every genre.&lt;ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist-lr|group=Notes|refs=
&lt;ref name=Yahweh.Idiosyncrasy &gt;Whereas the Israelites originated as Bronze Age Canaanites, the origin of Yahweh is indeterminate (see [[Yahweh#Bronze Age origins|Yahweh Â§Bronze Age origins]]). Following the introduction of Yahweh (localized to the [[Iron Age]] kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel (Samaria)]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]), a shift in [[theophoric]] naming occurred in which the original and most ancient biblical [[Theophoric_name#El|names paying tribute to El]] (Isra-el, Dani-el, Samu-el, Micha-el etc.) began to be displaced by [[Theophoric_name#Yahweh|names paying tribute to Yahweh]].{{pb}}[[Mark S. Smith]] sees the conflation of El and Yahweh as part of the process which he describes as "convergence" in the period of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Period of the Judges|Judges]] and the early monarchy. Convergence saw the coalescence of the qualities of other deities, and even the deities themselves, into Yahweh. ([http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/3972/the-early-history-of-god.aspx Mark S. Smith, 2nd edition of ''The Early History of Israel'', p.6-13]) Thus El became identified as a name of Yaweh, while Asherah ceased to be a distinct goddess. And the attributes of El, Asherah and Baal (notably, for Baal, his identification as a storm-god) were assimilated into Yahweh.{{pb}}Some of the idiosyncratic aspects of Yahweh  are described by Smith as "differentiation" in the period from the 9th century BC through to the [[Jewish diaspora|Exile]]. Differentiation identified and rejected certain Canaanite features i.e. Baal, child sacrifice, the asherah, worship of the sun and moon, and the cults of the "high places".

The '''Asphodel Meadows''' is a section of the ancient [[Greek underworld]] where ordinary souls were sent to live after death.

==Origin== 
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives [[Homer]] as the source for the English poetic tradition of describing the meadows of the afterlife as being covered in [[Asphodelus albus|Asphodel]]. In the translation by [[W. H. D. Rouse]], the passage in question (from ''The Odyssey'', Book 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey11.htm#_Toc90267984|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book XI|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is rendered, "the ghost of clean-heeled Achilles marched away with long steps over the meadow of Asphodel." In Book 24 in the same translation, the souls of the dead, "came to the Meadow of Asphodel where abide the souls and phantoms of those whose work is done."&lt;ref&gt;W.H.D. Rouse, trans. ''The Odyssey: The Story of Odysseus.'' New York: The New American Library, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer describes the experience of the dead souls and relates the meadow to its surroundings in these books and in Circe's brief description at the end of Book 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey10.htm#BkX503|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book X|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asphodelus albus|Asphodel]] flowers growing in the underworld is an idea that may predate [[Homer|Homer's]] writings,&lt;ref name=Reece&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reece|first=Steve|title=Homerâs Asphodel Meadow|journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies|year=2007|volume=47|issue=4|pages=389â400|url=http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/download/811/891}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the influence of [[Minoan religion|Minoan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=Bernard|title=Death and Afterlife in Minoan Religion|journal=Kernos|year=1997|volume=10|pages=19â38|url=http://kernos.revues.org/pdf/643|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] cultures whose afterlife was generally bright and fertile. Since the flower (á¼ÏÏÏÎ´ÎµÎ»Î¿Ï in Greek) was highly regarded throughout the ancient world it appears to have preserved its traditional positive role in the Greek afterlife. However Homer's meadows are not the place of perfect beauty they would become for post-Renaissance romantic English poets. In the Odyssey, the hero Odysseus sails to the very edge of the earth, beyond the place where Dawn rises (Odyssey 12.3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey12.htm|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book XII|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that foggy place the sun never shines. There he sees a grove of trees, the junction of two rivers and a meadow of Asphodel. This landscape perhaps predates the Odyssey and would have identified to the readers that this is the gateway to the underworld. The description of existence in the meadows is disturbing "The dead approach him in swarms, unable to speak unless animated by the blood of the animals he slays. Without blood they are witless, without activity, without pleasure and without future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Susan|title=Greek Mysteries: The Archaeology and Ritual of Ancient Greek Secret Cults|year=2003|editor=Michael B. Cosmopoulos|isbn=0415248728|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the ghost of the semi divine [[Teiresias]] is permitted by [[Persephone]] to retain the power to think independently, the rest "flit like shadows". Other references in the Odyssey to the meadows include the passage at 11.573&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey11.htm#BkXI541|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book XI|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the spirit of the hunter Orion herds together the spirits of his prey âthrough the Asphodel meadowâ, and the spirits of the slaughtered suitors arrive, squeaking like bats in a cave, "at the Asphodel meadow" (Odyssey, 24.13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey24.htm|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book XXIV|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later depictions==
The Asphodel Meadows is most probably where the souls of people who lived mediocre lives remain, but its relationship to other places in the Greek afterlife remains uncertain.

For later Greek poets the very ancient pre-Homeric association of the [[Asphodelus albus|Asphodel]] flower with a positive form of afterlife as well as the enlarged role of [[Elysium]] as it became the destination of more than just a few lucky heroes, altered the character of the meadows. Greek poets who wrote after Homer's time describe them as untouched, lovely, soft and holy. Such an evolutionary change is quite common: "Like most cultures throughout human history, both ancient and modern, the Greeks held complex and sometimes contradictory views about the afterlife".&lt;ref name=Reece/&gt;

Some depictions describe it as a land of utter [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]. That is, while the inhabitants were in life neither good nor evil, so they are treated in the afterlife. Other depictions have also stated that all residents drink from the river [[Lethe]] before entering the fields, thus losing their identities. This somewhat negative outlook on the afterlife for those who make little impact was perhaps passed down to encourage [[militarism]] in Greek cultures as opposed to inaction. In fact, those who did take up arms and became heroes were rewarded with everlasting joy in the fields of [[Elysium]].

[[Edith Hamilton]] suggests that the Asphodel of these fields are not exactly like the Asphodel of our world but are "presumably strange, pallid, ghostly flowers."&lt;ref&gt;Edith Hamilton. ''[[Mythology (book)|Mythology]]''. New York: Warner Books, 1999. Ch. 1, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that they were actually [[narcissi]].&lt;ref name=Dweck&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dweckdata.co.uk/Published_papers/Narcissus.pdf|last1=Dweck|first1=A.

The '''Blythe Intaglios''' or '''Blythe Geoglyphs''' are a group of gigantic figures incised on the ground near [[Blythe, California]] in the [[Colorado Desert]]. The ground drawings or geoglyphs were created by humans for an, as of yet, unknown reason. The [[intaglio (burial mound)|intaglios]] are located east of the [[Big Maria Mountains]], about {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of downtown Blythe, just west of [[U.S. Highway 95]] near the [[Colorado River]].  The Blythe Intaglios are the most well-known of the over 200 intaglios in the [[Colorado Desert]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leska|first=Amy|date=2008|title=A brief introduction to the intaglios of the Mojave Desert|url=|journal=Trough to trough|volume=|pages=125â126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colorado Desert contains the only known desert intaglios in North America.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These intaglios are mostly located along the Colorado River. The Blythe Intaglios contain three human figures, two four-legged animals, and a spiral; although Harner (1953) reported two spirals.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harner|first=Michael|date=1953|title=21. Gravel Pictographs of the Lower Colorado River Region|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest human figure in the Blythe Intaglio group  is {{convert|171|ft|m}} long. The intaglios are best viewed from the air.

[[Geoglyphs]] are found throughout the world, the construction methods range from earthen mounds, piles of stone, or the removal of surface plants or soil. The most famous desert intaglios are the [[Nazca Lines]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maillard|first=Frederico|date=2009|title=Geoglyphs on the Har Karkom Plateau (Negev, Israel)|url=|journal=Papers, XXIII Valcamonica Symposium 2009|volume=|pages=208â214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blythe Geoglyphs or intaglios (anthropomorphic geoglyphs) were created by scraping away layers of darker rocks or pebbles to reveal a stratum of lighter-valued soil. The displaced rocks outlined the figures and the exposed soil was stamped down which makes it more difficult for plants to grow in the lines. The intaglios are located on flat terraces in the Colorado River floodplain.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; While these "gravel [[pictograph]]s" are found through the deserts of southeastern California, human figures are found only near the Colorado River. Other intaglios depict mountain lions, birds, snakes, and unidentified zoomorphic and geometric shapes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The figures are so immense that many of them were not observed by non-Indians until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Gilreath, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of Blythe Intaglios and nearby geoglyphs include several dozen figures, thought to be ceremonial in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gilreath, pp. 288-89&lt;/ref&gt; No Colorado River Native American group has claimed to have made the intaglios, although some have claimed to use them.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; Many of the intaglios are believed to date from the prehistoric period, but their age and the identity of their creators are still uncertain. If the quadruped figures represent horses (reintroduced in North America by the Spanish) then a historical date would be supported.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; Jay von Werlhof and his collaborators  obtained 13 AMS radiocarbon dates for the figures, ranging from 900 BCE to 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;von Werlhof et al. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
In 1932, George Palmer, a pilot flying between [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Blythe, California]] noticed the Blythe geoglyphs.&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; His find led to a survey of the area in 1932 by Arthur Woodward, Curator of History and Anthropology at the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref&gt;Welfare and Fairley, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm J. Rogers subsequently studied and sketched the Blythe Intaglios in 1939.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt; After National Geographic published an article about the Blythe Intaglios in 1952, people began to visit the site which led to some destruction of the intaglios.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The interest in the Blythe intaglios lead to the search for and discovery of more desert intaglios. The Bureau of Land Management erected fences in 1974 to protect the intaglios and the Blythe Intaglios were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Similar intaglios, named the Ripley Group, were found nearby in Arizona across the Colorado River from Ripley, California.&lt;ref name="Harner 1953"/&gt;

==Topock Maze==
The [[Topock Maze]] or Mojave Maze, another geoglyph site near [[Needles, California]], covers {{convert|18|acre|m2}} and consists of a series of parallel [[windrow]]s approximately five feet apart.&lt;ref name="jk289"/&gt; However, it is unclear whether the Topock Maze was created by Native Americans.

[[Edward Curtis]] reported in 1908 that, "The Mohave Indians near by have utilized the area ... in recent years, as a maze into which to lure and escape evil spirits, for it is believed that by running in and out through one of these immense labyrinths, one haunted with a dread may bewilder the spirit occasioning it, and thus elude them."&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an unpublished mid-20th century report cited second-hand ethnographic information that, prior to 1900, the "Mohave used to put some of their men in the center of the area of alignment and left them to find their way out of the maze without crossing the gravel alignments. By doing this they would leave the devil behind them."&lt;ref name="Gilreath, p. 289"&gt;Gilreath, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ruth Musser-Lopez reviewed historic and archaeological evidence concerning the "maze" and found strong support for the conjecture that the feature was originally created as a result of late-nineteenth-century gravel harvesting for railroad construction and thus unrelated to the Blythe geoglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Musser-Lopez 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, old foot trails exist in undisturbed ground and stop at, but do not cross the lines of gravel indicating that the gravel is more recent than the trails. The Mojave people have denied knowing the origin of the Topock Maze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musser-Lopez|first=Ruth|date=2011|title="Mystic Maze" or "Mystic Maize": The Amazing Archaeological Evidence|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Society for California Archaeology|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
Patterns and circles at the site suggest that local groups may have danced there.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Trails lead to the intaglios and rock alignments and rock cairns are often nearby the intaglios.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Ethnographer [[Boma Johnson]] has tried to place the figures in context of [[Yuman]] [[oral history]] and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name=jk289/&gt; From this understanding, the figures portray mythic characters, and are often found where mythic events are thought to have occurred.&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; One of the notable mythic figures is a 20-to-25-meter long humanoid figure located next to a second glyph, this of a quadruped resembling a [[mountain lion]].&lt;ref name=jk289&gt;Gilreath, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall figures bearing a likeness to [[Mastamho]] and [[Kataar]], the "hero twins of the creation myth," can be seen near [[Fort Mojave]] in Arizona.

Some researchers hypothesize that the intaglios are stopping points on a keruk pilgrimage or simply the practice of the keruk ceremony at various places.&lt;ref name="Altschul &amp; Ezzo 1995 133â145"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altschul &amp; Ezzo|first=|date=1995|title=Ceremony and Warfare along the Lower Colorado River during the Protohistoric Period|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Society for California Archaeology|volume=|pages=133â145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keruk was a mourning ceremony that was practiced by various Native Americans in southern California. The keruk included the reenactment of the creator's death and the recognition of the people who had died since the last keruk. Warfare has been offered a possible explanation as to the spread along the Colorado River of ceremonies such as the keruk and the similar style of desert intaglios.&lt;ref name="Altschul &amp; Ezzo 1995 133â145"/&gt;

Of the nearly 60 sites containing humanoid figures, almost all of them have a deeply entrenched torso, while the limbs are much more shallowly etched into the surface. Often, the head and/or one or more arms of the figure will not have been represented at all.&lt;ref name=jk289/&gt; The largest human figure is 171 feet (52 m) long, while the smallest is 95 feet (29 m) long.&lt;ref name="Gilreath, p. 289"/&gt;

==Location==
The majority of the Blythe geoglyphs are located {{convert|16|mi|km}} north of [[Blythe, California]], off [[Highway 95]], at the [[Interstate 10]] exit and down several dirt roads for {{convert|15.5|mi|km}}. An historical marker (No. 101) placed by the California Department of Public Works, Division of Highways, commemorates the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Marael |title=Why Stop? A Guide to California Roadside Historical Markers |year=1995 |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |location=Houston, TX |isbn=9780884159230 |oclc= 32168093 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chain link fences surround several of the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; 
The intaglios were featured prominently in the Hardy Boys novel ''[[Mystery of the Desert Giant]]''', published in 1961.

'''Bongoyo Island''' (or simply Bongoyo) is an uninhabited [[island]] in [[Tanzania]], situated 2.5km north of the country's largest city, [[Dar es Salaam]]. It is the most frequently visited of the four islands of the [[Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve]] (DMRS) and a popular daytrip for both tourists and Tanzanian residents alike for snorkelling and sunbathing.

The island lies close to the [[Msasani]] Peninsula (in the [[Kinondoni]] district of the city) and is reachable by means of a 30-minute boat ride from the mainland. The point of departure for most visitors to the island is 'The Slipways' hotel complex on the western side of the Msasani Peninsula.

The island has a very rocky shore and only two beaches. All visitors visit the beach at the northwestern tip of the island, where the boats moor and where there are some huts, drinks and food. The much longer but narrower beach along the northeastern side has no facilities and is mostly deserted. The entire island (apart from the beaches) is covered in dense forest and has a few walking trails, so only a few people venture there. The terrain is somewhat treacherous with sharp rocks. In the middle of the island one finds the remains of a German colonial building at {{coord|6|42|8.48|S|39|16|11.49|E|region:TZ}}, clearly visible on Google Maps. The Indian Ocean has penetrated the northern shore of the island, creating a tidal lagoon along whose shores there are some [[mangroves]].

[[File:Valby Bakke - Bombardement of Copenhagen 1807.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|The British Bombardment of Copenhagen 1807]]]]
'''Copenhagenization''' refers to the practice of [[Confiscation|confiscating]] the [[warship]]s of a defeated enemy. It first occurred when the [[British fleet]] under [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Admiral Gambier]] landed Army units equipped with phosphorus loaded [[Congreve rockets]] for the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle]] of [[Copenhagen]] in 1807.

After the British Navy stole a part of the Dano-Norwegian Navy (merchant ships as well as Men of wars, which at the time was located in Eastern Zealand), the practice of confiscating all (or most) of the ships of a defeated enemy became more common and would be expressed by the term '''Copenhagenize'''. In 1830, the American author Richard Emmons published an ''Epic poem on the [[War of 1812|late war of 1812]]'', ''The Fredoniad, or Independence preserved''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the outbreak of hostilities.   Also, in the 1881 ''Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States'', John J. Lalor, editor, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, even when the [embargo] was repealed in 1809, the belief that Great Britain would "Copenhagenize" any American navy which might be formed was sufficient to deter the democratic leaders from anything bolder than non-intercourse laws, until the idea of invading [[Canada]] took root and blossomed into a declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;CyclopÃ¦dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States by the Best American and European Writers. Published: New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899. II.18.13 and II.18.26.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1940, after the [[Fall of France]], the British destroyed the warships of [[Vichy France|neutral Vichy]] stationed in the ports of [[Oran]] and [[Dakar]] with the [[attack on Mers-el-KÃ©bir]], fearing that the [[French Navy|French ships]] would fall into [[Nazi Germany|German]] hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War In Human Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRnxxGxfMLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=azar+gat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj404_yof7XAhUhhuAKHVemACQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=azar%20gat&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher = Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-1992-3663-3|page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Croatia}}
The '''counties of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|[[Å½upanija|Å¾upanije]]}}) are the primary [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|administrative subdivisions]] of the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]].&lt;ref name=law3&gt;[http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=2405 The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (consolidated text) - Croatian Parliament].Retrieved 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since they were re-established in 1992, Croatia has been divided into 20 [[county|counties]] and the [[capital city]] of [[Zagreb]], which has the authority and legal status of both a county and a [[List of cities in Croatia|city]] (separate from the surrounding [[Zagreb County]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Chamber of Economy]]|url=http://hgk.biznet.hr/hgk/tekst.php?a=b&amp;page=tekst&amp;id=680|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507094819/http://hgk.biznet.hr/hgk/tekst.php?a=b&amp;page=tekst&amp;id=680|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 May 2006|language=Croatian|title=Gospodarski profil Grada Zagreba i ZagrebaÄke Å¾upanije|trans-title=Economic profile of the City of Zagreb and the Zagreb County|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1997_01_10_151.html|title=Zakon o podruÄjima Å¾upanija, gradova i opÄina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans-title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|date=30 January 1997|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the counties are subdivided into 128 cities and 428 (mostly rural) [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]].&lt;ref name="CountiesAct2006"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o podruÄjima Å¾upanija, gradova i opÄina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans-title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popovaca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/popovaca-dobila-status-grada-237487|title= PopovaÄa dobila status grada|date=12 April 2013|work=[[Poslovni dnevnik]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
County assembly ({{lang-hr|Å¾upanijska skupÅ¡tina}}) is a representative and deliberative body in each county. Assembly members are elected for a four-year term by popular vote ([[proportional representation|proportional system]]  with [[closed list]]s and [[d'Hondt method]]) in [[Elections in Croatia|local elections]].&lt;ref name=Law2&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=144/2012|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2012_12_144_3074.html|title=Zakon o lokalnim izborima|trans-title=Local Elections Act|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of each county's government is headed by a [[Prefect|county prefect]] ([[Prefect|county president]]) ({{lang-hr|[[Å¾upan]]}}), except that a [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] heads the city of Zagreb's executive branch. Croatia's county prefects (with two deputy prefects), mayor of Zagreb (with two deputy mayors){{efn|Also city mayors and municipality presidents with deputies.}} are elected for a four-year term by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a [[runoff election]] if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting ([[Majority vote|majoritarian vote]], [[two-round system]]).&lt;ref name=Law2/&gt; County prefects (with deputy prefects and mayor of Zagreb with his/her deputies) can be recalled by a referendum. County administrative bodies are administrative departments and services which are established for the performance of works in the self-governing domain of the county, as well as for the performance of works of state administration transferred to the county. Administrative departments and services are managed by heads (principals) nominated by the county prefect on the basis of a public competition.&lt;ref name=Law1&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=19/2013|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2013_02_19_323.html|title=Zakon o lokalnoj i podruÄnoj (regionalnoj) samoupravi (proÄiÅ¡Äeni tekst)|trans-title=Local and Regional Self-Government Act (consolidated text)|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each county exists a State Administration Office ({{lang-hr|Ured drÅ¾avne uprave}}) which performs the tasks of the central government (under [[Ministry of Public Administration (Croatia)|Ministry of Public Administration]]). Head of State Administration Office (''predstojnik Ureda drÅ¾avne uprave''), who is a university graduate in law, is appointed by the [[Croatian Government]] (in the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]] the [[mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] is responsible for the state administration).These offices ("administrations") are not subordinate to the county assembly or county prefect, but rather the direct presence of the state (similar to [[governorate]]s or [[prefecture]]s in certain countries).

==Funding and tasks==

The counties are funded by the central government, as well as from county-owned businesses, county taxes and county fees. County taxes include a five percent [[inheritance tax|inheritance]] and [[gift tax]], a motor vehicle tax, a vessel tax and an [[arcade game]] machine tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Tax Administration|url=http://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/porezi/v_poreza.asp?id=b01d1|title=The Croatian tax system|accessdate=15 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615111709/http://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/porezi/v_poreza.asp?id=b01d1|archivedate=15 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Financijska teorija i praksa|publisher=Institute of Public Finance|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=8875|title=Fiskalna decentralizacija u Hrvatskoj: problemi fiskalnog izravnanja|trans-title=Fiscal Decentralisation in Croatia: Problems of Fiscal Equalisation|author1=Anto Bajo|author2=Mihaela BroniÄ|volume=28|issue=4|date=December 2004|pages=445â467|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The counties are tasked with performing general public administration services, [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], government funded [[Healthcare in Croatia|healthcare]], social welfare, administration pertaining to agriculture, forestry, hunting, fisheries, mining, industry and construction, and other services to the economy at the county level, as well as road transport infrastructure management and issuing of building and location permits and other document in relation to construction in the county area excluding the area of the big city and the county seat city; the central government and local (city and municipal) governments may also perform each of those tasks at their respective levels according to the law.&lt;ref name="Law1"/&gt;

The Croatian County Association was set up in 2003 as a framework for inter-county cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrvzz.hr/en/about-us/80-hrvatska-zajednica-upanija.html|title=Croatian County Association|accessdate=10 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

The Croatian (singular) term ''Å¾upanija'' was originally applied to territory controlled by a ''[[Å¾upa]]n'' (official title).&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt; Since the 12th century, the counties have also been referred to by the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''[[wikt:comitatus|comitatus]]''.&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;

==History==

Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Medieval-Counties"&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Å kolska knjiga]] |journal=Historijski zbornik |volume=5 |issue=1â2 |year=1952 |format=PDF |url=http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1952/HZ_5_11_MANDIC.pdf |author=Oleg MandiÄ |language=Croatian |title=O nekim pitanjima druÅ¡tvenog ureÄenja Hrvatske u srednjem vijeku |trans-title=On some issues regarding Croatia's social system in the Middle Ages |pages=131â138 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the [[House of TrpimiroviÄ]]'s rule. The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority.

The following eleven are usually listed as the oldest counties of Croatia, dating back to the 10th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Split-Dalmatia County]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.dalmacija.hr/OÅ½upaniji/OpÄipodaci/Povijest/IzpovijestiSDÅ¾upanijeIV/tabid/64/Default.aspx|title=Iz povijesti Splitsko-dalmatinske Å¾upanije IV.|trans-title=Outline of history of the Split-Dalmatia County (4)|accessdate=6 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903021202/http://www.dalmacija.hr/O%C5%BDupaniji/Op%C4%87ipodaci/Povijest/IzpovijestiSD%C5%BEupanijeIV/tabid/64/Default.aspx|archivedate=3 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Livno]] (encompassing the [[Livanjsko polje]])
* Cetina (centered on the [[Cetina]] river, with its seat in [[Stolac]])
* [[Imotski]] (south of Livno County and [[Biokovo]])
*Pliva (around the [[Pliva (river)|Pliva]] and [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] rivers)
*Pset or Pesenta (between the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana (river)|Sana]] rivers)
*Primorje or [[Klis]] (along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]'s coast between [[Å ibenik]] and [[OmiÅ¡]], with its seat in the [[Klis Fortress]])

*[[Knin]] (with its seat in the [[Knin Fortress]])
* Sidraga (in the area between Bribir County and Zadar)
* Nina or Luka (between Knin, Nona, Sidraga and Bribir counties)

In the same period, the counties in [[Principality of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] (north of [[Petrova Gora|Gvozd Mountain]]) are poorly documented. It is generally thought that the Pannonian counties were directly subject to the Croatian monarchy, unlike the southern counties controlled by nobles.&lt;ref name="Counties-History"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=DruÅ¡tvena istraÅ¾ivanja|issn=1330-0288|publisher=Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences|volume=1|issue=1|date=September 1992|author=Josip VrboÅ¡iÄ|title=Povijesni pregled razvitka Å¾upanijske uprave i samouprave u Hrvatskoj|language=Croatian|trans-title=A historical review of the development of county administration and self-government in Croatia|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=51854|pages=55â68|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county number, extent and authority have varied significantly, reflecting: changes in the monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries.&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; In the 13th and 14th century, the [[Croatian nobility]] grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[free royal cities]], and separately the cities of [[Dalmatia]]. After Croatia became a crown land of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;

The divisions have changed over time, reflecting: territorial losses to [[CroatianâOttoman Wars|Ottoman conquest]] and subsequent Croatian [[Great Turkish War|recapture]] of some territory; changes in the political status of [[Dalmatia]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Dubrovnik]] and [[Istria]]; and political circumstances, including the [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union]] and [[CroatianâHungarian Settlement|settlement]] between Croatia and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=4WwsAAAAMAAJ|author=[[Ivo Goldstein]]|language=Croatian|title=Hrvatske Å¾upanije kroz stoljeÄa|trans-title=Croatian counties through the centuries|publisher=[[Å kolska knjiga]]|year=1996|isbn=9789530613676|accessdate=10 April 2012|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas]] brought upon numerous political changes and introduced a civic government of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] as part of [[Austria-Hungary]], which in turn proceeded to absorb the [[Croatian Military Frontier|Croatian]] and [[Slavonian Military Frontier]]s in 1881. During the second half of the 19th century Croatian counties went through various reorganizations (1848-1850, 1850-1854, 1854-1861, 1861-1870, 1870-1874, 1874-1886, 1886-1914) that also reflected the position of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austrian Empire]] (after 1867 the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]); the last major reorganisation of the counties was in 1886, when eight counties were established within the kingdom. This layout largely remained in effect until the Croatian counties were abolished in 1922,&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; while some minor adjustments of county boundaries happened in 1913.&lt;ref name="Dubravica"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PolitiÄka misao|issn=0032-3241|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]], Faculty of Political Sciences|title=PolitiÄko-teritorijalna podjela i opseg civilne Hrvatske u godinama sjedinjenja s vojnom Hrvatskom 1871â1886|trans-title=Political and territorial division and scope of civilian Croatia in the period of unification with the Croatian military frontier 1871â1886|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=38709&amp;lang=en|author=Branko Dubravica|pages=159â172|volume=38|issue=3|date=January 2002|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counties were set up as self-governmental units in contrast to earlier county incarnations since the Middle Ages. Each had an assembly ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''Å¾upanijska skupÅ¡tina'') with the wealthiest taxpayers comprising half the assembly members and elected members comprising the remaining half. Supreme prefect ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''veliki Å¾upan'') was appointed by the king and county officials by the [[Ban of Croatia|ban]]. Managing board of each county had 6 members elected by the county assembly, while the remaining members were county officials ''ex officio'' (supreme prefect, viceprefect, county health supervisor etc.). Counties were divided into districts ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''kotari'' as government units similar to Austrian [[District (Austria)|Bezirke]]), while municipalities ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''opÄine'') and cities ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''gradovi'') were units of local self-government.&lt;ref name="Counties-History"/&gt;

The traditional division of Croatia into counties was abolished in 1922, when the [[oblast]]s of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] were introduced; these were later replaced by the [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C|author=Richard C.

The counties were reintroduced in 1992, but with significant territorial alterations from the pre-1922 subdivisions; for instance, before 1922 [[Transleithania]]n Croatia was divided into eight counties, but the new legislation established fourteen counties in the same territory.

The [[Districts of Kenya|districts]] of [[Kenya]] are divided into 262 '''[[Division (subnational entity)|divisions]]''' (''matarafa''). Divisions of Kenya are further subdivided into [[Locations of Kenya|locations]]. The counties of Kenya are based on the merging of some of the districts on this list and since the divisions are one level under the districts they are the sub-counties. This is because [[Kenya]] recently changed its constitution and 47 [[Counties of Kenya|Counties]] emerged. Here are the divisions listed below, by district (before the change in administration):

The [[Division (subnational entity)|divisions]] are subdivided into approximately 1,088 "locations" (''mtaa'') and then "sublocations" (''kata ndogo''). A province is administered by a Provincial Commissioner (PC).

[[Local authorities of Kenya|Kenyan local authorities]] mostly do not follow common boundaries with divisions. They are classified as City, Municipality, Town or County councils.

A third discrete type of classification are ''constituencies''. They are further subdivided into ''wards''.

'''''Astrolabe''''' was a horse [[barge]] converted to an exploration ship of the [[French Navy]] and was originally named ''Coquille''. She is famous for her travels with [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]. The name derives from an early [[navigational instrument]], the [[astrolabe]], a precursor to the [[sextant]].

== Career ==
=== Voyage under the command of Louis Isidore Duperrey===
[[Louis Isidore Duperrey]] commanded ''Coquille'' on its circumnavigation of the earth (1822â1825) with [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] as second. [[RenÃ©-PrimevÃ¨re Lesson]] also travelled on ''Coquille'' as a naval doctor and naturalist. On their return in March 1825, Lesson and Dumont brought back to France an imposing collection of animals and plants collected on the [[Falkland Islands]], on the coasts of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], in the archipelagos of the Pacific and [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="KSDDM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chambers, Keith S.  |author2=Munro, Doug |title=The Mystery of Gran Cocal: European Discovery and Mis-Discovery in Tuvalu |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_89_1980/Volume_89,_No._2/The_%26apos%3Bmystery%26apos%3B_of_Gran_Cocal%3A_European_discovery_and_mis-discovery_in_Tuvalu,_by_Doug_Munro,_p_167-198/p1|year=1980|volume= 89|issue=2|journal= The Journal of the Polynesian Society|pages=167â198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the voyage the ship spent two weeks in the [[Bay of Islands]] in the north of [[New Zealand]] in 1824.&lt;ref name="ESNZC"&gt;{{cite web| work=Early shipping in New Zealand waters|title= ''Coquille''|date =|url= http://www.myancestorsstory.com/shiplist_05.html | accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the return voyage to France the ship sailed through the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]).&lt;ref name="KSDDM"/&gt;

===First Voyage under the command of Jules Dumont d'Urville===
''Coquille'' was renamed ''Astrolabe'' in honour of one of the ships of [[Jean-FranÃ§ois de Galaup, comte de La PÃ©rouse|La PÃ©rouse]]. She sailed from Toulon on 22 April 1826, towards the Pacific Ocean, for a circumnavigation of the world that was destined to last nearly three years.

''Astrolabe'' explored parts of [[New Zealand]]. In January 1827, the French explorer Dumont d'Urville arrived in [[Tasman Bay]] in the north of the [[South Island]]. A number of landmarks around Tasman Bay were named by d'Urville and his crew including [[D'Urville Island, New Zealand|d'Urville Island]], [[French Pass]] and [[Torrent Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theprow.org.nz/d-urville-s-tasman-bay-odyssey/#.UPmE0B2R-So&lt;/ref&gt; Dumont then sailed along the east coast of the [[North Island]]. On 12 March 1827 ''Astrolabe'' entered the [[Bay of Islands]].&lt;ref name="ESNZA"&gt;{{cite web| work=Early shipping in New Zealand waters|title= ''Astrolabe''|date =|url= http://www.myancestorsstory.com/shiplist_02.html | accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Astrolabe'' then visited [[Fiji]], after which [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] executed the first relief maps of the [[Loyalty Islands]] (part of French [[New Caledonia]]) and explored the coasts of [[New Guinea]]. He confirmed the site of La PÃ©rouseâs shipwreck in [[Vanikoro]] (one of the [[Santa Cruz Islands]], part of the archipelago of the [[Solomon Islands]]) and collected numerous remains of his boats. The voyage continued with the mapping of part of the [[Caroline Islands]] and the [[Moluccas]]. The ''Astrolabe'' returned to Marseille on 25 March 1829.

===Second Voyage under the command of Jules Dumont d'Urville===
Dumont wanted to do further exploration of the Pacific Ocean, however King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] ordered that the second expedition aim for the [[South Pole|South Magnetic Pole]] and to claim it for France; if that was not possible, Dumontâs expedition was asked to equal the most southerly latitude of 74Â°34'S achieved in 1823 by [[James Weddell]]. Thus France became part of the international competition for polar exploration, along with the United States and the United Kingdom. ''Astrolabe'' and [[French ship ZÃ©lÃ©e (1812)|''ZÃ©lÃ©e'']] sailed from Toulon on 7 September 1837.

After reaching the [[South Orkney Islands]], the expedition headed directly to the [[South Shetland Islands]] and the [[Bransfield Strait]]. In spite of thick fog they located some land only sketched on the maps, which Dumont named Terre de Louis-Philippe (now called [[Graham Land]]), the [[Joinville Island group]], and Rosamel Island (now called [[Andersson Island]]). As most of the crew had obvious symptoms of scurvy, at the end of February 1838, Dumont accepted that he was not able to continue further south, and he continued to doubt the actual latitude reached by Weddell. He therefore directed the two ships towards [[Talcahuano]], in Chile, where he established a temporary hospital for the crew members affected by scurvy.

The ships then sailed to the [[Marquesas Islands]] then to [[Hobart]] in Australia on the way south.  The expedition followed the coast of Antarctica then carried out experiments to determine the approximate position of the [[South magnetic pole]].

They sighted the [[schooner]] {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}} of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] commanded by [[Charles Wilkes]], but due to poor communication, contact was not made.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=William|title=The Great United States Exploring Expedition|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520025571|pages=176â177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 1840, Dumont decided to turn to the north heading for Hobart, which the two ships reached 17 days later. They were present for the arrival of the two ships of [[James Clark Ross|James Ross]]âs expedition to Antarctica.

On 25 February 1840, the ships sailed towards the [[Auckland Islands]], where they carried out magnetic measurements. The expedition returned via New Zealand, the [[Torres Strait]], [[Timor]], [[RÃ©union]], [[Saint Helena]] and finally Toulon, returning on 6 November 1840.

==Legacy==
The [[Astrolabe Subglacial Basin]] in Antarctica bears her name, as do the [[Astrolabe Glacier]], the [[Astrolabe Needle]], [[Astrolabe Island]], [[Great Astrolabe Reef]] (off [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]] island, [[Fiji]]) and [[Astrolabe Reef]] (New Zealand).

'''Hallasan''' is a [[shield volcano]] on [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]] of [[South Korea]]. It is the highest
[[mountain]] in [[South Korea]].  The area around the mountain is a designated [[national park]], the [[Hallasan National Park]] (''Hallasan Gungnip Gongwon''/íë¼ì°êµ­ë¦½ê³µì/{{lang|ko|æ¼¢æå±±åç«å¬å}}). Hallasan is commonly considered to be one of the three main mountains of South Korea, along with [[Jirisan]] and [[Seoraksan]].

==Names==
Hallasan is the highest mountain in South Korea and is worshipped by people because they think that gods and spirits live on it. Alternate English names for the mountain include '''Hanla Mountain''' or '''Mount Halla''' and older English sources refer to the peak as '''Mount Auckland'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]].

=== Hallasan ===
''Han'' represents the universe, and ''la'' means "pull". Both words mean that the mountain is high enough to pull the universe. According to the old legend, if anyone were to climb up the mountain, see a star and call out ë¸ì¸ì±, they could live a longer life.

=== Jinan ===
The name represents a mountain that is located at the back side of a town and protects the town's residents. Jeju people called Hallasan Jinan because Hallasan blocked winds that were blowing from the Pacific Ocean and also protected the residents.

=== Dumuak ===
Dumuak is another name for Hallasan. The name represents the bold head mountain. According to a legend, a hunter accidentally ripped God's belly button. God expressed his anger by ripping off the peak of Hallasan. The remaining part of the mountain became Baengnokdam (ë°±ë¡ë´) and the ripped part of the mountain became Sanbangsan (ì°ë°©ì°).

=== Wonsan ===
Wonsan became the name of Hallasan because the center of the mountain is the highest point and the mountain looks like a circular cone. On a very clear day, Hanllasan is visible from the mainland.

=== Yeongjusan ===
Yeongjusan was believed to be a habitat for a plant species that made people immortal. According to a legend, immortal wizards of Korea used to live in Hallasan. They were immortal because of this special plant. Qinshi Huang wanted the plant to live forever and ordered his men to get the plant (200 AD).

=== Buak ===
Buak became the name of Hallasan, because of the peak of the mountain. The crater of the mountain looks like a big pond. According to a legend, a white deer used to drink the water here.&lt;ref name="ë¯¼ì¡±ë¬¸íëë°±ê³¼ì¬ì "&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0061563|title=ë¯¼ì¡±ë¬¸íëë°±ê³¼ì¬ì |website=encykorea.aks.ac.kr|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and geography==

=== Hallasan ===
Hallasan is a massive [[shield volcano]] which forms the bulk of [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]] and is often taken as representing the island itself. There is a local saying that "Jeju Island is Hallasan, and Hallasan is Jeju." The mountain can indeed be seen from all places on the island, but its peak is often covered in clouds. The mountain has been designated Korea's [[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument]] no.&amp;nbsp;182.

The soil of Hallasan is mostly made out of volcanic ash, which mainly contains [[volcanic ash]], volcanic [[sand]], and [[lapilli]]. The organic contents of the soil are higher than any other soil in South Korea, but [[drainage]] is also better than any other place in South Korea. The soil is not the best for farming.&lt;ref name="ë¯¼ì¡±ë¬¸íëë°±ê³¼ì¬ì "/&gt; The volcanic island was constructed, starting in the [[Pliocene]] epoch, on the [[continental shelf]], which is about 100&amp;nbsp;m (300&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level in that area.  Eruptions of [[basalt]] and [[trachyte]] [[lava]] built the island above sea level, and it now reaches a height of {{Convert|1950|m|ft|0}}.  A large [[volcanic crater]] over {{Convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} in diameter tops the volcano.  About 360 [[parasitic cone]]s, or ''oreum'' (ì¤ë¦) in the [[Jeju dialect]], are found on the volcano's flanks. Most of them are [[cinder cone]]s and [[scoria cone]]s, but there are also some [[lava dome]]s and about 20 [[tuff ring]]s near the coast and offshore, which were formed by underwater [[phreatic eruption]]s. The most recent eruptions are estimated to be about 5,000 years ago, which puts the volcano into the active classification, meaning it has erupted in the last 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcano.si.edu/gvp_about.cfm |title=About Global Volcanism Program |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |date=2013 |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeju&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=4391 |title=âThere could be volcanic activity, but we donât knowâ: Jeju younger than previously thought, highlights dearth of knowledge about Mt. Hallasan  |newspaper=The Jeju Weekly |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=September 1, 2015 |author=Park, Yea Eun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation as active is not agreed to by all, as more monitoring and study are needed to better understand the volcano.&lt;ref name=Jeju /&gt;

=== Baengnokdam ===
[[Image:Halasan.jpg|thumb|right|Crater lakes on Hallasan.]]
There is a [[crater lake]] on Hallasan called Baengnokdam (ë°±ë¡ë´/{{lang|ko|ç½é¹¿æ½­}}), literally "white deer lake." It is formed by the collapse of the top of the ridge by the movement of magma underground.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ì¤ì , íìí, ì ì°¨ì° (2005), "ì ì£¼ë íë¼ì°ì ì§ì§". ì§ì§ííì§ ì 41ê¶ ì 4í¸ (íµê¶ ì 165í¸), 2005.12. Page. 481-497&lt;/ref&gt; There is a legend attributing the name of the lake to otherworldly men who descend from heaven to play with [[white stag|white deer]]. Depending on the season, the circumference of the lake is up to 2 kilometers with a depth up to about 100 meters.

The configurative rocks of the eastern and western walls of Baengnokdam are different. The eastern wall is covered with basalt lava 2 ~ 5 m thick at its top. In the lower part, there is a high-concentration stream sediment layer of the Tamra layer. The western wall is made of the trachyte lava dome. The volcanic wall formed by the eruption of the lava should be composed of lava, analysis. However, the eastern wall is composed of the clastic sedimentary sediments, so it is not a crater by lava eruption but a pit crater. Namely, the trachyte magma, which formed the Baengnokdam trachyte, was elevated on the dome, and the trachyte magma formed lava dome at its top. The inclination and direction of the Tamra Formation of Baengnokdam cannot be measured directly at Baengnokdam, but it is N10W of slope and 30NE of slope measured near the valley below North Baengnokdam, 1,580 m above sea level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Tendency of wind change by Hallasan ====
In order to understand the tendency of temperature change in Jeju Island, the short-term forecasting model of Halla, the weather data of the Korean peninsula, and the wind vector of AWS is analyzed. When the south winds flow into the sea, sea winds form around Hallasan, and the sea breeze is formed on the downwind side of the sea. On the coast, winds and the sea breezes gather around the coasts to form Eddy, and the highest temperature occurs in the region where Eddy occurs.

==== Tendency of maximum temperature by Hallasan ====
In order to understand the tendency of maximum temperature in Jeju Island, the area where the highest temperature occurred when the wind was weak was surveyed and analyzed. In the morning, when the reverse layer is formed and the wind is weak, the warm air of the lower layer is raised when the air movement between the upper and lower layers is blocked, and it is placed on the upper floor by the sea breeze, which affects the temperature rise in the mid-mountainous area.

The occurrence of the highest temperature coincides with the formation position of Eddy, and when the wind is weak, it is formed in the middle mountain region. When the wind is weak, the warmth is accumulated in the middle layer, so the maximum temperature in the mid-mountainous area is higher than the maximum temperature of the low-altitude coastal area about 1~3â, and 4â or higher on the downwind side.

When the wind is blowing at 4 ~ 9&amp;nbsp;m/s, the wind phenomenon occurs mainly, so the weak sea breeze coming from the sea is formed on the coastal area and the peak temperature is mainly observed during the daytime.

==== Tendency of minimum temperature by Hallasan ====
The change of the minimum temperature varies depending on the degree of cooling of Hallasan and the intensity of the wind speed.When the wind blows due to the predominance of sea breeze, the air cooled in Hallasan descends to the coastal area and induces the decrease in temperature. When the synoptic wind blows strongly, the cold air of Hallasan moves to the downwind side and the lowest temperature appears. The lowest temperature in the downwind area is 2 ~ 5â lower than in other areas, and the lowest temperature often appears at night.

When the weak northwestern synoptic winds are blown, the lowest temperature appears in the eastern part of Jeju Island. The chill of the top of Hallasan descends downhill along the mountain range and is collected in the eastern part of Jeju Island so the morning temperature drops a lot.

==== Inter-regional temperature variation by Hallasan ====
For the last five years, the deviation of temperature (maximum temperature - minimum temperature) increased in spring between March and May. The reason for the large deviation in spring is because the phenomenon occurs frequently by Hallasan.

==  Ecosystem ==
Hallasan was isolated from the mainland for a long time and its species were able to become unique and different from mainland species. The elevation of the mountain causes various plant species to live there. The mountain became a habitat for plants that live in low elevation and plants that live in high elevation. 50 or more unique species live in Jeju Island, especially in high elevation area in Hallasan. Various animal species also live on the mountain. Because of the geography of the mountain, the same species evolved in different ways after thousands of years. Just like plant species, animal species originally living in cold and hot climates use the mountain as their habitat. There are a total of 160 bird species that use Hallasan as a habitat. Only 19 species are considered as a natural monument and protected by the government. Ravens are commonly seen in the hiking trail. A total of 3,315 insect species live on the mountain. 254 spider species also live there. A study found that spider habitat is concentrated more on the north side of the mountain. Ticks live on the mountain and gave lots of damage to Jeju residents a long time ago. The damage caused by ticks is still continuing these days. Six tick species give damage to domestic animals.

===Plants===
According to the world floral region, Hallasan belongs to the temperate subregion with Yangtze River basin and southwest Japan. From the coast to the top of the Hallasan, plants are distributed vertically from the subtropical plants to the alpine plants due to the environmental gradient. Of the 4,000 species of vascular plants native to Korea, about 400 species are estimated to be endangered or potentially rare. Especially, 23 species-specific wild plants designated by the Ministry of Environment ( totally 59 species ) are distributed in Jeju Island and 6 of them can be found in the natural reserve area of Hallasan. Also, about 50 kinds of special plants are distributed in Jeju Island, especially in the highlands of Hallasan.

===Animals===
Because of the geographical character of the island, there are many subspecies due to isolation even though they are the same species. Also, Hallasan is a place where the polar animal and the tropical animal coexist due to the difference of the climate zone according to the elevation.

====Mammals====
The mammals of Jeju Island are distributed among 5 orders and 114 families and 5 species {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Thus, the distribution of mammals in Jeju Island is very poor in species and numbers because Jeju island is isolated from the Korean peninsula long ago. Their population has been reduced due to the decrease in food because of the use of rodenticides and pesticides in recent years and indiscreet fishing. Weasels, badgers, and gazelles are inhabited in Hallasan. The number of weasels and badgers are significantly reducing. Boar and Formosan deer is already extinct. Roe deer, the largest mammal in Hallasan, was once in danger of extinction. But now its population increased due to protection policies and a lot of efforts by people in Jeju island.

====Amphibians and reptiles====
Most of amphibians and reptiles in Jeju Island are Korean native animals but there are anti-Korean animals since Jeju Island is located between Japan and China. As the climate is mild, except for the mountainous areas, sub-tropical forests and frigid forests are well harmonized and virgin forests are well protected. Mt. Halla is particularly well-suited for amphibians and reptiles as a hideout, with well-developed grasslands and marshlands, and is rich in food.

====Birds====
There are 364 kinds of birds in Jeju Island, 91 kinds of passing birds, 100 kinds of birds in winter, 42 kinds of resident birds and 43 kinds of vagrants. Among the birds in Jeju Island, except for the species that live in habitat for migratory birds and coastal regions, there are 160 species inhabiting mainly in Mt. Halla. There are 19 species designated as natural monuments.

==Temple==
The mountain is home to Gwaneumsa (ê´ìì¬/{{lang|ko|è§é³å¯º}}), the oldest [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple on the island. The temple was originally built during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (1046-1083) during King Munjong (ë¬¸ì¢). Like many other temples in Korea, Gwaneumsa was destroyed in 1702 and closed for 200 years. The temple was rebuilt in 1908. It spread Buddhism again in Jeju Island. There is a memorial site outside the temple to commemorate the victims of the [[Jeju massacre|Jeju uprising]] that took place between 1948 and 1950. It is one of the most visited places on the island.

==Trails==

There are five hiking trails on Hallasan.

* Gwaneumsa Trail (ê´ìì¬ íë°©ë¡/{{lang|ko|è§é³å¯º æ¢è¨ªè·¯}})  - 8.7&amp;nbsp;km
* Eorimok Trail (ì´ë¦¬ëª© íë°©ë¡/ì´ë¦¬ëª© {{lang|ko|æ¢è¨ªè·¯}})    - 4.7&amp;nbsp;km
* Seongpanak Trail (ì±íì íë°©ë¡/{{lang|ko|åæ¿å²³ æ¢è¨ªè·¯}}) - 9.6&amp;nbsp;km
* Yeongsil Trail (ìì¤ íë°©ë¡/{{lang|ko|éå®¤ æ¢è¨ªè·¯}})    - 3.7&amp;nbsp;km
* Donnaeko Trail (ëë´ì½ íë°©ë¡/ëë´ì½{{lang|ko|æ¢è¨ªè·¯}})   - 9.1&amp;nbsp;km

The Donnaeko trail was reopened to the public on December 4, 2009, after a fifteen-year hiatus. Only the Gwaneumsa and Seongpanak trails lead to the summit. The Donnaeko, Eorimok and Yeongsil courses only go as far as Witse Oreum (ìì¸ì¤ë¦), as the rest of the trail leading to the peak has been closed off since 1994 in order to restore and protect the vegetation.

=== Gwaneumsa Trail  ===
To go to Gwaneumsa Trail by car, you should use road number 1117 which connects Jeju Arra-dong Mountain and Tamra Education Center and Cheon-Wangsa. From Jeju city hall to Gwaneumsa Information Center, it takes about 25 minutes and from Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 50 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride Jeju city bus number 475. Since this bus doesn't enter the city, you have to get off and transfer at the entrance of Jeju University. In the past, it operated only on weekends and holidays, but it can be used on weekdays since the 2017 bus route reorganization. If you have to take a bus to Jeju city or Seogwipo city, the closest stop is Jeju medical center at 5.16 road. It takes about 4 ~ 50 minutes on foot. Even if you come down the mountain at a late time, this route's bus would come in handy, since this bus comes until 20:20.

===  Eorimok Trail  ===
To go to Eorimok Trail by car, you should use road number 1139 ( or 1100 ) which connect Jeju City and Seogwipo City Jungmun-dong. From Jeju city hall, it takes about 35 minutes and from Jungmun-dong, it takes about 50 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride bus number 240. ( Dispense interval about 1hr. )

===  Seongpanak Trail  ===
To go to Seongpanak Trail by car, you should use road number 1131 (or 516) which connect Jeju city and Seogwipo city. From Jeju city hall to the Seongpanak Information Center, it takes about 30 minutes. From Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 40 minutes. If you want to use public transformation, ride buses on road 516, which are 181, 182, 281. Since these buses come in an interval of only 10~15 minutes, the route with the best accessibility is this route.

===  Yeongsil Trail  ===
The Yeongsil Trail is connected to the Gwaneumsa Trail by road number 1100. This makes the transportation information really similar. Actually, the way of public transportation is same. But the time to come and go is quite different since these two trails are 30 minutes away by car. From Jeju city hall to the Yeongsil Information Center, it takes about 50 minutes. From Jungmun to Yeongsil Information Center, it takes about 30 minutes.

===  Donnaeko Trail  ===
To go to Donnaeko Trail by car, you should use road number 1115 which connects Jeju city Araun mountain river, Tamra education center, and Chunwangsa temple. From Jeju city hall to Donnaeko Information Center, it takes about 60 minutes and from Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 25 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride Seogwipo city bus 610-1. You should be aware that this bus goes to the mourning gallery (ì¶©í¼ë¬ì§, which is the entrance) only 6 times a day. It takes about 4~50 minutes on foot.

'''Harringay Online''' is a [[hyperlocal]] social network based in the neighbourhood of [[Harringay]], north London.

==History==
[[Image:HoL 4 Wiki.jpg|thumb|310px|right|Harringay Online]]

Started on 1 July 2007, Harringay Online was one of the first neighbourhood websites to be set up using [[social media]] technology.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55085c8ee4b022164d6d58e6/t/55477815e4b03d21cf4da857/1430747157473/Local-by-Social-2010.pdf {{cite book|last = Gibson|first = Andy|title = Local By Social|publisher = NESTA | year = 2010  }}]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with the stated aim of strengthening the community in the neighbourhood of Harringay in the north [[London Borough of Haringey]]. The site aims to achieve a blend of web-based and real world neighbourhood interactions.&lt;ref name=Azyan&gt;[http://www.lgeoresearch.com/LGEONewsletters/Vol1.pdf {{cite book|last = Azyan|first = Liz|title = Exploring Online Neighbourhoods|publisher = LGEO Research | year = 2009  }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harringay Online explains its aims as achieving four main outcomes:&lt;ref name=Azyan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joining&gt;{{cite book|title = Joining the Conversation|publisher = Young Foundation, I&amp;DEA, Local Government Association | year = 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Building a sense of place in a neighbourhood â an understanding and appreciation of the neighbourhood to encourage a  feeling of belonging and regarding a place as home.
* Building social capital in the neighbourhood â building networks, norms and trust that enable people to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives â simply put building community spirit or neighbourliness.
* Empowering local people to take action to shape their neighbourhood â working to improve local peopleâs ability to influence local decisions and affect local circumstances.
* Engaging people in local democratic processes.

The site's main structure is:&lt;ref name=Azyan/&gt;
* Main Page - summarising and linking to all content.
* Forum - for discussions on local and sometimes non-local issues.
* Blogs - for blog type pieces.
* Gallery - pictures &amp; videos including an extensive series of film footage and photos on Harringay's history.
* Local Information - a wide range of local links and information including weekly updates.
* Events - calendar of local events.
* Local News - local news stories aggregated from around the internet.

The site is a well used local site and receives between 1500 and 3000 unique users per day.&lt;ref name=Azyan/&gt; An email update is circulated weekly to all members.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;

Harringay Online is regularly referenced around the world as an exemplary, community-led, hyperlocal website, being referred to recently by [http://www.urbaninitiatives.co.uk/ Urban Initiatives] as "the gold standard for community websites".&lt;ref name=ONN/&gt; It has been recognised by two national awards and was awarded a Judge's Special Commendation by the Prime Minister in the UK's 2008 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417083335/https://www.nesta.org.uk/social-technology-projects-praised-by-prime-minister-for-creating-positive-social-impact/ Catalyst Awards].&lt;ref name=ONN&gt;{{cite book|title = Online Networked Neighbourhoods Study|publisher = Capital Ambition, London Councils | year = 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009 it was highly commended in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621202300/http://www.sustainitawards.co.uk:80/2009-awards-results.html National eWell-Being Awards].&lt;ref name=ONN/&gt;

In 2010 it was a focus for the UK-based study on local websites, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170627022811/http://networkedneighbourhoods.com:80/?page_id=409 the ''Online Neighnourhood Networks Study'']

With a stated target population of 22,500, by 2018, it had signed over 12,500 members.

'''ISO 3166-2:FR''' is the entry for [[France]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for France, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for the following subdivisions:
* [[Metropolitan France]] (two levels):
** [[Regions of France|12 metropolitan regions]]
** [[Corsica|1 collectivity]]
** [[Departments of France|96 metropolitan departments]] (still as they were before 1 January 2015 when one department was split in two parts, one of them being a metropole and not a department: the two new entities are still not encoded in ISO 3166-2)
* [[Overseas France]]:
** 3 overseas departments
** 1 dependency
** 3 overseas regions
** 9 overseas territorial collectivities&lt;ref name="note:NC"/&gt;

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|FR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of France. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;): former metropolitan regions (until December 31, 2015);
* two digits, or a digit followed by a letter: metropolitan departments;
* two letters: overseas departments, dependency, and overseas territorial collectivities;
* three letters: metropolitan regions (since January 1st, 2016).

The codes for the metropolitan departments use their [[INSEE code]]s, which are currently used in [[postal codes in France|postal codes]], and used in [[vehicle registration plates of France|vehicle registration plates]] until 2009. INSEE codes are assigned as follows:
* &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;â&lt;code&gt;89&lt;/code&gt; except &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt;: departments created before the 20th century, assigned in alphabetical order (prefixes in the form of "Bas-" and "Haute-" are ignored at the primary sort level), except [[Paris]] and [[Yvelines]], which replaced the former departments [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] respectively after the reorganization of the [[Ãle-de-France (region)|Paris region]] in 1968;
* &lt;code&gt;90&lt;/code&gt;: [[Territoire de Belfort]], which was given department status in 1922;
* &lt;code&gt;91&lt;/code&gt;â&lt;code&gt;95&lt;/code&gt;: departments created after the reorganization of the Paris region in 1968;
* &lt;code&gt;2A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2B&lt;/code&gt;: [[Corse-du-Sud]] and [[Haute-Corse]], which were created after the division of [[Corsica]] in 1975, whose INSEE code was &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt;.

The codes for the overseas departments, dependency, and overseas territorial collectivities use their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

| [[RhÃ´ne (department)|RhÃ´ne]]&lt;ref&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FR-69&lt;/code&gt; code in ISO 316-2 still covers the department of RhÃ´ne as it was before 1 January 2015 when it was split in two parts, one of which is no longer a department but a ''mÃ©tropole'' with specific status. Still, the ''MÃ©tropole de Lyon'' and the new department of RhÃ´ne are administratively managed by the French state as a single ''circonscription dÃ©partementale'' (departmental constituency) that keeps the old department code.&lt;br /&gt; Where distinction is needed, [[Institut national de la statistique et des Ã©tudes Ã©conomiques|INSEE]] uses &lt;code&gt;69&lt;/code&gt; to cover the new ''circonscription dÃ©partementale du RhÃ´ne'' for the state-controlled administration in its ''prÃ©fecture'' (covering the whole former ''dÃ©partement du RhÃ´ne'' before January 2015), and assigned new codes for the two separate local collectivities: &lt;code&gt;69D&lt;/code&gt; for the new (smaller) ''dÃ©partement du RhÃ´ne'', and &lt;code&gt;69M&lt;/code&gt; for the new ''MÃ©tropole de Lyon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:MN''' is the entry for [[Mongolia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Mongolia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Mongolia|1 capital city and 21 provinces]]. The capital of the country [[Ulaanbaatar]] has special status equal to the provinces.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|MN}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Mongolia. The second part is either of the following:
* one digit: capital city
* three digits: provinces

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

The '''John F. Kennedy Space Center''' ('''KSC''', originally known as the NASA '''Launch Operations Center''') is one of ten [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] [[NASA facilities#NASA field centers|field centers]]. Since December 1968, Kennedy Space Center has been NASA's primary launch center of human spaceflight. Launch operations for the [[Apollo Program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and [[Space Shuttle Program|Space Shuttle]] programs were carried out from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]] and managed by KSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Space Center Implementing NASAâs Strategies|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/plans/KSCImp00.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS). The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and even own facilities on each other's property.

Though the first Apollo flights, and all [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]] flights took off from CCAFS, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APPENDIX 10 - GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING PROJECT MERCURY|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4001/app10.htm|website=NASA History Program Office|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. PROJECT SUPPORT FROM THE NASA Centers|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-45/ch2.htm|website=MERCURY PROJECT SUMMARY (NASA SP-45)|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida ([[Mercury Control Center]], later the [[Launch Control Center]]) began handing off control of the vehicle to the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] shortly after liftoff; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury Mission Control|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/MCCgallery/|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipartito"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipartito|first1=Kenneth|last2=Butler |first2=Orville |title='A History of the Kennedy Space Center|date=2007|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-3069-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and [[In-Situ Resource Utilization]] for off-Earth exploration.&lt;ref name="Research &amp; Tech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &amp; Technology|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/exploration/researchtech/index.html|website=Kennedy Space Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user [[spaceport]] through industry partnerships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Partnerships Launch Multi-User Spaceport|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-partnerships-launch-multi-user-spaceport|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015|date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; even adding a new launch pad ([[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39#Launch Pad 39C|LC-39C]]) in 2015.

There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped across the center's 144,000 acres.&lt;ref name="Master Plan 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Creating New Master Plan|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/kscmasterplanrevision.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the unique facilities at KSC are the 525&amp;nbsp;ft tall [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] for stacking NASA's largest rockets, the [[Launch Control Center]] - which conducts space launches at KSC, the [[Operations and Checkout Building]], which houses the astronauts dormitories and suit-up area, a [[Space Station Processing Facility|Space Station factory]], and a 3-mile-long [[Shuttle Landing Facility]]. There is also a [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex|Visitor Complex]] open to the public on site.

==Formation==
The military had been performing launch operations since 1949 at what would become [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. In December 1959, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] transferred 5,000 personnel and the Missile Firing Laboratory to [[NASA]] to become the Launch Operations Directorate under NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].

President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1961 goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 required an expansion of launch operations. On July 1, 1962, the Launch Operations Directorate was separated from MSFC to become the '''Launch Operations Center (LOC).''' Also, Cape Canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth {{convert|363|ft|m|adj=on}} tall, {{convert|7500000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} thrust [[Saturn V]] rocket, which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads. Therefore, the decision was made to build a new LOC site located adjacent to Cape Canaveral on [[Merritt Island]].

NASA began land acquisition in 1962, buying title to {{convert|131|sqmi}} and negotiating with the state of Florida for an additional {{convert|87|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=MOONPORT5-11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch5-11.html|title=Land, Lots of Land â Much of It Marshy |work=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |author=Charles D. Benson and William Barnaby Faherty|publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major buildings in KSC's Industrial Area were designed by architect [[Charles Luckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muschamp|first=Herbert|title=Charles Luckman, Architect Who Designed Penn Station's Replacement, Dies at 89|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/28/arts/charles-luckman-architect-who-designed-penn-station-s-replacement-dies-at-89.html|accessdate=August 22, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in November 1962, and Kennedy visited the site twice in 1962, and again just a week before [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name="KSC History Quiz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy History Quiz|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/quiz_page_prt.htm#4|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 1963, the facility was given its current name by President Lyndon B. Johnson under [[s:Executive Order 11129|Executive Order 11129]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The National Archives, Lyndon B. Johnson Executive Order 11129 | url = https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1963-johnson.html | accessdate =April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KSC Story"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Space Center Story|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/story/kscstory.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's order joined both the civilian LOC and the military Cape Canaveral station ("the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range") under the designation "John F. Kennedy Space Center", spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind. NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] clarified this by issuing a directive stating the ''Kennedy Space Center'' name applied only to the LOC, while the Air Force issued a general order renaming the military launch site ''Cape Kennedy Air Force Station''.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"&gt;{{cite book

==Location==
Located on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], the center is north-northwest of [[Cape Canaveral]] on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] on Florida's [[Space Coast]], due east of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. It is {{convert|34|mi|km}} long and roughly {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} wide, covering {{convert|219|sqmi}}.

KSC is a major central Florida [[tourist destination]] and is approximately one hour's drive from the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] area. The [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] offers public tours of the center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Because much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed, the site also serves as an important [[wildlife sanctuary]]; [[Mosquito Lagoon]], [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], [[Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Canaveral National Seashore]] are other features of the area. Center workers can encounter [[bald eagle]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[Razorback|wild boars]], [[Crotalus adamanteus|eastern diamondback rattlesnakes]], the endangered [[Florida panther]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and [[West Indian manatee|Florida manatees]].

==Historical programs==

===Apollo program===

{{main|Apollo program|List of Apollo missions}}
[[File:Saturn V aerial.jpg|thumb|upright|A Saturn V carrying [[Apollo 15]] rolls out to Pad 39A in 1971 on [[Mobile Launcher Platform 1|Mobile Launch Platform 1]].]]

From 1967 through 1973, there were 13 Saturn V launches, including the ten remaining Apollo missions after Apollo 7. The first of two unmanned flights, [[Apollo 4]] (Apollo-Saturn 501) on November 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from KSC. The Saturn V's first manned launch on December 21, 1968 was [[Apollo 8]]'s lunar orbiting mission. The next two missions tested the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]: [[Apollo 9]] (Earth orbit) and [[Apollo 10]] (lunar orbit). [[Apollo 11]], launched from Pad A on July 16, 1969, made the first Moon landing on July 20. [[Apollo 12]] followed four months later. From 1970â1972, the Apollo program concluded at KSC with the launches of missions 13 through 17.

===Skylab===
{{Main|Skylab}}
On May 14, 1973, the last [[Saturn V]] launch put the Skylab space station in orbit from Pad 39A. By this time, the Cape Kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the Saturn IB were decommissioned, so Pad 39B was modified to accommodate the Saturn IB, and used to launch three manned missions to Skylab that year, as well as the final Apollo spacecraft for the [[ApolloâSoyuz Test Project]] in 1975.

===Space Shuttle===
{{main|Space Shuttle program|List of space shuttle missions}}
[[File:STS-60 Launch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Shuttle ''Discovery'']] launching from Pad 39A on [[STS-60]], February 3, 1994]]
[[File:STS-36 Rollout - GPN-2000-000680.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] is moved to Pad 39A for the 1990 launch of [[STS-36]].]]
[[File:STS-129 Atlantis Ready to Fly - edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' is seen on launch pad 39A at the NASA Kennedy Space Center shortly after the rotating service structure was rolled back on Nov. 15, 2009.]]
As the Space Shuttle was being designed, NASA received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than KSC, which demanded study. KSC had important advantages, including: its existing facilities; location on the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]; and its southern latitude, which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits. Disadvantages included: its inability to safely launch military missions into [[polar orbit]], since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the Carolinas or Cuba; corrosion from the salt air; and frequent cloudy or stormy weather. Although building a new site at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in New Mexico was seriously considered, NASA announced its decision in April 1972 to use KSC for the shuttle.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | year=1998 | pages=425â427 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030205042/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control, the launch of ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' on April 12, 1981 for its first orbital mission [[STS-1]], was NASA's first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launches.

In 1976, the VAB's south parking area was the site of Third Century America, a science and technology display commemorating the [[U.S. Bicentennial]]. Concurrent with this event, the U.S. flag was painted on the south side of the VAB. During the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the Space Shuttle. Two [[Orbiter Processing Facility|Orbiter Processing Facilities]] were built near the VAB as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.

KSC's {{convert|2.9|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] (SLF) was the orbiters' primary end-of-mission landing site, although the first KSC landing did not take place until the tenth flight, when ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' completed [[STS-41-B]] on February 11, 1984; the primary landing site until then was [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California, subsequently used as a backup landing site. The SLF also provided a [[Return To Launch Site|return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort]] option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/slf.html Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF)]. Science.ksc.nasa.gov. Retrieved on May 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 24 successful shuttle flights, ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|was torn apart]] 73 seconds after the launch of [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986; the first shuttle launch from Pad 39B and the first U.S. manned launch failure, killing the seven crew members. An [[O-ring]] seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff, leading to subsequent structural failures. Flights resumed on September 29, 1988 with [[STS-26]] after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program.

On February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' and her crew of seven were lost during [[re-entry]] over Texas during the [[STS-107]] mission (the 113th shuttle flight); a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from Pad 39A on January 16, when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiter's external fuel tank struck the orbiter's left wing. During reentry, the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure. Like the ''Challenger'' disaster, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|resulting investigation and modifications]] interrupted shuttle flight operations at KSC for more than two years until the [[STS-114]] launch on July 26, 2005.

The shuttle program experienced five [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]] shutdowns at LC-39, all within four seconds before launch; and one [[Abort to Orbit|abort to orbit]], [[STS-51-F]] on July 29, 1985. Shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes, conducting space science and technology experiments, [[ShuttleâMir Program|visits to the Russian MIR space station]], construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]], deployment and servicing of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and serving as a [[Spacelab|space laboratory]]. The shuttle was retired from service in July 2011 after 135 launches.

===Constellation===
On October 28, 2009, the [[Ares I-X]] launch from Pad 39B was the first unmanned launch from KSC since the Skylab workshop in 1973.

Beginning in 1958, NASA and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches (previously referred to as unmanned),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Style Guide for NASA History Authors and Editors|url=https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/styleguide.html|website=NASA's History Office|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; cooperating as they broke ground in the field. In the early 1960s, NASA had as many as two robotic mission launches a month. The frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles, as engineers gathered data, learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades. In 1963, with the intent of KSC [[Expendable launch vehicle|ELV]] work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities, a separate Atlas/Centaur organization was formed under NASA's Lewis Center (now [[Glenn Research Center|Glenn Research Center (GRC)]]), taking that responsibility from the Launch Operations Center (aka KSC).&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt;

Though almost all robotics missions launched from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS), KSC "oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape."&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt; In 1965, KSC's Unmanned Launch Operations directorate became responsible all NASA unmanned launch operations, including those at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. From the 1950s to 1978, KSC chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the U.S., overseeing their near launch processing and checkout. In addition to government missions, KSC performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also, though non-U.S. government entities provided reimbursement. NASA also funded CCAFS launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements.

All this changed with the [[Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984]], after which NASA only coordinated its own and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) ELV launches. Companies were able to "operate their own launch vehicles"&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt; and utilize NASA's launch facilities. Payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of KSC. Reagan's 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from KSC to commercial companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Directive on National Space Policy|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/policy88.html|website=NASA|publisher=White House|accessdate=November 6, 2015|date=February 11, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, launch complexes on CCAFS started transferring from NASA to air force management.&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt;

In the 1990s, though KSC was not performing the hands-on ELV work, engineers still maintained understanding of ELVs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight. KSC also worked on ELV research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize KSC personnel as a resource for technical issues. KSC, with the payload and launch vehicle industries, developed advances in automation of the ELV launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of U.S. rockets against the global market.&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt;

In 1998, the [[Launch Services Program]] (LSP) formed at KSC, pulling together programs (and personnel) that already existed at KSC, GRC, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and more to manage the launch of NASA and NOAA robotic missions. CCAFS and VAFB are the primary launch sites for LSP missions, though other sites are occasionally used. LSP payloads such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] have been processed at KSC before being transferred to a launch pad on CCAFS.

===Space station processing===
As the [[International Space Station]] modules design began in the early 1990s, KSC began to work with other NASA centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the Space Shuttles. KSC utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 [[Spacelab]] missions in the [[Operations and Checkout Building]] to gather expectations of ISS processing. These experiences were incorporated into the design of the [[Space Station Processing Facility]] (SSPF), which began construction in 1991. The Space Station Directorate formed in 1996. KSC personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt;

From 1997 to 2007, KSC planned and performed [[Space Station Processing Facility#Station Integration Testing|on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules]]: three Multi-Element Integration Testing (MEIT) sessions and the Integration Systems Test (IST). Numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit.

Today KSC continues to process ISS payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbit.&lt;ref name="ISS Payloads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Space Center Payload Processing|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/stationpayloads/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch Complex 39===
{{main|Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39}}
[[File:Aerial View of Launch Complex 39.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (center) in 1999, with the [[Launch Control Center]] jutting out from its right, and Pads A and B in the distance]]
[[File:Kennedy Space Center VAB.jpg|thumb|Close-up photo of the VAB.]]

[[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] (LC-39) was originally built for the [[Saturn V]], the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history, for the [[Apollo program|Apollo manned Moon landing program]]. Since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, LC-39 has been used to launch every NASA human space flight, including [[Skylab]] (1973), the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (1975), and the [[Space Shuttle program]] (1981-2011).

Since December 1968, all launch operations have been conducted from [[launch pad]]s A and B at LC-39. Both pads are on the ocean, {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of the VAB. From 1969â1972, LC-39 was the departure point for all six [[Apollo program|Apollo]] manned Moon landing missions using the [[Saturn V]], and was used from 1981&amp;ndash;2011 for all [[Space Shuttle]] launches.

Human missions to the [[Moon]] required the large three-stage Saturn V rocket, which was {{convert|363|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|33|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=off}} in diameter. At KSC, [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] (LC-39) was built on Merritt Island to accommodate the new rocket. Construction of the $800&amp;nbsp;million project began in November 1962. LC-39 pads A and B were completed by October 1965 (planned Pads C, D and E were canceled), the VAB was completed in June 1965, and the infrastructure by late 1966.

The complex includes:
* the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB), a {{convert|130000000|ft3|m3}} hangar capable of holding four Saturn Vs. The VAB is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume, and was the largest when completed in 1965.&lt;ref name="congressional record Sep 8, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Senate|journal=Congressional Record|date=September 8, 2004|page=17598}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Crawler-transporter|transporter]] capable of carrying 5,440 tons along a [[crawlerway]] to either of two launch pads;
* a {{convert|446|ft|m|0|adj=on}} mobile [[service structure]], with three [[Mobile Launcher Platform]]s, each containing a fixed launch umbilical tower;
* the [[Launch Control Center]]; and
* a [[Launch Complex 39 Press Site|news media facility]].

The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, operated by [[Delaware North]] since 1995, has a variety of exhibits, artifacts, displays and attractions on the history and future of human and robotic spaceflight. Bus tours of KSC originate from here. The complex also includes the separate [[Apollo/Saturn V Center]], north of the VAB and the [[United States Astronaut Hall of Fame]], six miles west near [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]]. There were 1.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2009. It had some 700 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Amanda | last=Stratford | title=NASA's new image | url=http://www.app.com/article/A9/20100112/NEWS02/1120326/-1/SCIENCE| work=Florida Today | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1A | date=January 12, 2010 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on May 29, 2015 that the Astronaut Hall of Fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the Visitor Complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled "Heroes and Legends". The attraction, to be designed by Orlando-based design firm Falcon's Treehouse, is slated to open sometime late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=James|title=KSC Visitor Complex introduces 'Heroes and Legends'|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/29/ksc-visitor-complex-breaks-ground-on-major-new-attraction/28142981/|website=Florida Today|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor force==
When KSC separated from [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in July 1962, it took 375 employees with it.

In May 1965, KSC had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in Cocoa Beach to the new Merritt Island facilities. The peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 (3,000 were civil servants). In 1970, [[President Nixon]] announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at KSC. By 1974, KSC's workforce was down to 10,000 employees (2,408 civil servants).&lt;ref name=Lipartito/&gt;

A total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. Approximately 2,100 &lt;!--2010. Didn't put this to avoid reader confusion---&gt;are employees of the federal government; the rest are contractors.&lt;ref name="jdean"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dean |first=James |title=NASA budget woes leads to layoffs|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20110317/AGENCY01/103170305/|accessdate=August 21, 2011|newspaper=[[Federal Times]]|date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was $77,235.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Patrick | last=Peterson | title=High-paying jobs scant outside KSC | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20101128/NEWS01/11280317/High-paying-jobs-scant-outside-KSC| publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1A | date=November 28, 2010 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, preceded by the cancellation of [[Constellation Program]] in 2010, produced a significant downsizing of the KSC workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the Apollo program in 1972. As part of this downsizing, 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the Center during 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=James | last=Dean | title=Laid-off KSC workers' supplies eagerly accepted by educators | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20111105/NEWS01/311050019/Laid-off-KSC-workers-supplies-eagerly-accepted-by-educators| newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 2B | date=November 5, 2011 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film appearances==
In addition to being frequently featured in documentaries, Kennedy Space Center has been portrayed on film many times. Some studio movies have even gained access and filmed scenes within the gates of the space center. If extras are needed in those scenes, space center employees are recruited (employees use personal time during filming). Films with scenes at KSC include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sangalang|first1=Jennifer|title=Hey, girl: Casting call for Ryan Gosling movie 'First Man' at Kennedy Space Center|url=https://www.floridatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/19/casting-call-ryan-gosling-movie-first-man-kennedy-space-center/1046767001/|website=Florida Today|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=30 January 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Fiji''' is the [[United Kingdom]]'s foremost diplomatic representative in the [[Fiji|Republic of Fiji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukinfiji.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/our-high-commission/high-commissioner/previous-high-commissioners |title=Previous High Commissioners to Fiji |accessdate=2013-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019001756/http://ukinfiji.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/our-high-commission/high-commissioner/previous-high-commissioners |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiji gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. As fellow members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the United Kingdom and Fiji conduct their diplomatic relations at [[government]]al level, rather than between [[Head of State|Heads of State]]. Therefore, the countries exchange [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]], rather than [[ambassador]]s.

British High Commissioners to Fiji (or, from 1988 to 1997, British Ambassadors to Fiji) have [[Dual accreditation|also acted]] at various times as Ambassadors or High Commissioners to the [[Republic of Kiribati]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of Nauru]], the [[Kingdom of Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]] and the [[Republic of Vanuatu]].

'''The list of countries obtaining independence from Spain''' is a list of countries that broke away from [[Spain]] for independence, or occasionally incorporation into another country, as depicted in the map below. These processes came about at different periods and world regions starting in the 17th century (Portugal).

==Independence waves==
Since its beginnings in the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish empire]] conquered new areas starting out from its Castilian core kingdom. In 1597, the Spanish (Castilian) crown lost the [[Netherlands|Netherlands (Holland)]]. In 1640, Portugal split away after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] had incorporated it to its domains in 1581. A second independence tide came about following the [[American Revolutionary War|Independence of the Thirteen Colonies]] in North America and the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] that heralded the end of the Spanish Atlantic hegemony. [[History of Venezuela|Venezuela]] (1811), under the influence of [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas|the Basque Enlightenment]], [[Spanish American wars of independence|sparked the independence movements of Central and Southern America]], spearheaded by [[SimÃ³n BolÃ­var|Simon Bolivar]].&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanities âº History &amp; Culture  Independence from Spain in Latin America|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/independence-from-spain-in-latin-america-2136406|website=ThoughtCo|publisher=Dotdash|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=SimÃ³n BolÃ­var: The Liberator|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/liberators/bolivar.htm|website=latinamericanstudies.org|publisher=Dr. Antonio Rafael de la Cova|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Restoration (Spain)|During the Spanish Restoration]] in the late 19th century, the last major colonies Cuba, Puerto Rico and Philippines detached from the metropolis with the support of the United States. Since the 50s of the 20th century, Spain lost the last continental lands in Africa, [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Ifni]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Western Sahara]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo"/&gt;

[[File:Blick vom Luitpoldturm nach Osten.JPG|thumb|right|View from the [[Luitpold Tower]] on the [[WeiÃenberg (Frankenweide)|WeiÃenberg]] over the central Palatine Forest to the east]]

This '''list of mountains and hills in the Palatine Forest''' contains a selection of the highest or more notable peaks located in the natural region of the [[Palatine Forest]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (maximum {{HÃ¶he|672.6|DE-NHN|link=true}}).

The mountain range is formed from a slab of [[Bunter sandstone]], about 500 metres thick, that is characterized by a complex [[relief]] with deeply incised [[V-shaped valley]]s, many different hill shapes and dense [[forest]]s. Because its [[rock strata]] were tilted during the formation of the [[Upper Rhine Graben]] and descend from east to west, its highest points, which climb to over {{HÃ¶he|600|DE-NHN}}, are found in the [[Haardt]], a long ridge that forms the edge of the Palatine Forest in the east above the Rhine Plain. In the central Palatine Forest is the plateau of [[Frankenweide]], in which several more mountains are located that also exceed the 600 metre mark. By contrast, the hills in the north of the Palatine Forest, i.&amp;nbsp;e. in the [[Stumpfwald]] and Otterberg Forest, only reach about 350 to {{HÃ¶he|450|DE-NHN}}; they are largely embedded in erosion surfaces and rise only around 100 to 150 metres above them. Considerably more varied are the hills of the southern Palatine Forest, a region also known as the [[Wasgau]] which, as a unified natural region, crosses the border and runs as far as the [[Col de Saverne]]. Its small-scale surface topology includes numerous, different hill shapes â characterized by [[conical hill]]s for example â with heights range from 450 to {{HÃ¶he|550|DE-NHN}}. They often exhibit bizarre rock formations, that in many cases have been used for the construction and location of [[rock castle|rock]] and [[hill castle]]s.

Because not all the mountains and hills of the Palatine Forest can be included in this list, a number of criteria have been used to make the selection. Of prime importance have been their [[geomorphological]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[relief (geology)|relief]] etc.), [[biological]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[flora]] like [[forest]] coverage and [[wood|contiguity]]), [[cultural historic]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[castle]]s, former [[cultic site]]s), touristic (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[observation tower]]s, [[Palatine Forest Club]] huts etc.) and [[infrastructural]] features (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[transport]] routes, [[industry|industrial usage]] etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Geiger: ''Die Landschaften of the Pfalz.'' In: Michael Geiger (ed): ''Geographie of the Pfalz.''Verlag PfÃ¤lzische Landeskunde, Landau/Pfalz 2010. pp. 92â93&lt;/ref&gt;

== Table ==
Entries in the table are sorted by height in metres above [[NormalhÃ¶hennull|sea level (NHN)]]. However, the table may also be sorted by the data in columns 1 to 5 by clicking the symbol at the head of the wanted column. In the "Name" column, alternative names for the mountains and hills are given in brackets, in small, italic font. Names that recur are disambiguated by place names in brackets and small font.

The abbreviations used in the table are explained [[List of mountains and hills of the Palatine Forest#Abbreviations|below]].

'''Maksimir Park''' is the oldest [[public park]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. It forms part of the city's [[cultural heritage]] and is a habitat for many different plant and animal species.

==History==

Founded in 1787, Maksimir Park was the first large public park in [[South-Eastern Europe]], and predates the majority of Europe's public park foundings.&lt;ref name=ocg&gt;{{ cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to the Garden |author=ed. Patrick Taylor |year=2006 |pages=295â6 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-866255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was opened in 1794&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.park-maksimir.hr/maksimir_en/Maksimir_povijest_parka_en.htm | title=Park's History | work=park-maksimir.hr | accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the initiative of the man for whom it was named, Bishop [[Maksimilijan Vrhovac]] of Zagreb (1752â1827).&lt;ref name=ocg/&gt; At that time, the park was located on the outskirts of the city, although today it is surrounded by many of the city's neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It was formerly a dense forest of hornbeams (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'') and oaks (''[[Quercus robur]]'' and [[Quercus petraea|''Q.&amp;nbsp;petraea'']]). The remainder of the original forest survives as a girdle to the park, the area in total measuring above {{convert|1005|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=ocg/&gt;

==Landscaping==
[[File:Zagreb - Maksimirsko jezero u travnju.JPG|thumb|Maksimir Park in April.]]
Although the landscaping was first conceived by Bishop Vrhovac in the [[baroque]] style,&lt;ref name=ocg/&gt; in 1839,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Bishop [[Juraj Haulik]] (1788â1869), and others redesigned the park. Haulik's vision was very much in line with [[Biedermeier]]ist notions, and romantic [[neoclassicism]], with elements from [[historicism]]; and in emulation of the park at the [[Laxenburg]] estate of the [[Habsburgs]].
[[File:Maksimir areal (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Aerial photo]] of Maksimir Park.]]
The process of transforming Maksimir Park involved the felling of the forest interior, the grading of hills, the excavating of great holes for lakes, the laying of paths, and construction of bridges.&lt;ref name=ocg/&gt;

Others who were instrumental in the making of the park were sculptors [[Anton Dominik Fernkorn]] (1813â1878), and [[Josip Kassmann]] (1784â1856); master gardener [[Franjo Serafin Korbler]] (1812â1866); landscape architect [[Michael Sebastian Riedel]] (1763â1850); and architect [[Franz SchÃ¼cht]].&lt;ref name=ocg/&gt;

SchÃ¼cht's contributions include, among others, Paviljon Jeka (The Pavilion of Echoes), a lookout known as the Kiosk, and a house called Å vicarska kuÄa (The Swiss House).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Design==
[[File:Turtles in Maksimir.jpg|thumb|Turtles in the Maksimir lake.]]
The park has several big meadows, numerous creeks, and five lakes, and is a habitat for various plant and animal species, such as the Middle Spotted Woodpecker (''[[Dendrocopos medius]]''), an endangered species in Europe.&lt;ref name="General Data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.park-maksimir.hr/Maksimir_en/Maksimir_o_parku_en.htm|title=General Data|work=park-maksimir.hr|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zagreb Zoo|Zagrebâs Zoo]] also forms part of the parkâs territory, located in the southern part of Maksimir Park.

In addition to the park, the name ''Maksimir'' may also refer to one of Zagrebâs neighborhoods and NK Dinamoâs stadium, both of which are adjacent to the park.

==Location and access==
Maksimir is located in the eastern central part of the city. 

[[ZET]] tram lines 4, 5, 7, 11 and 12 frequently connect the park to the rest of the city. A stop named '''BukovaÄka''' is located at the main entrance into the park.

A less frequent bus route 226 from a nearby Svetice terminal connects to the [[Mirogoj]] cemetery and goes on to the [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] terminal in the old city centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19810">The [[Montserrat national football team]] is the representative [[association football]] team of the small [[Caribbean]] island of [[Montserrat]]. Football is the second most popular sport in Montserrat after cricket, and official competitive football on the island is governed by the [[Montserrat Football Association]] (MFA).&lt;ref name="almanack"/&gt; The association is affiliated to the [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF) and the team has, as of December 2009, entered seven [[Caribbean Cup]] competitions and three [[FIFA World Cup]] qualification campaigns. Montserrat played their first international fixture in 1991, which ended in a 0â3 defeat by [[Saint Lucia national football team|Saint Lucia]]. In their second match, they secured a 1â1 [[Tie (draw)|draw]] with [[Anguilla national football team|Anguilla]]. Montserrat lost their next seven matches before achieving their first ever victory on 26 March 1995, when they defeated Anguilla 3â2 at the [[Blakes Estate Stadium]] in [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]]. Montserrat also went on to win their next match, again defeating Anguilla 1â0.&lt;ref name="almanack"/&gt;

In 1995, football on the island was halted due to the activity of the [[SoufriÃ¨re Hills]] volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/news/newsid=80543/index.html|title=F.A. helps Montserrat rise from the ashes|publisher=[[FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA)|date=8 January 2002|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFA became a full [[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) member in 1996,&lt;ref name="almanack"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Guy|title=FIFA Almanack of World Football 2006|publisher=Headline|date=2005|pages=636â637|isbn=0-7553-1419-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the team did not play another international match for a further three years after this, when they entered the [[1999 Caribbean Nations Cup]]. They were knocked out in the Preliminary Round of the tournament, losing 1â6 over [[two-legged tie|two legs]] to the [[British Virgin Islands national football team|British Virgin Islands]]. Montserrat entered the FIFA World Cup for the first time in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], but were beaten 1â6 on aggregate by the [[Dominican Republic national football team|Dominican Republic]] in the First Qualifying Round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/preliminaries/preliminary=3881/matches/match=19434/report.html |title=Dominican Republic 3â0 Montserrat |date=5 March 2000 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071455/http://fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition%3D4395/preliminaries/preliminary%3D3881/matches/match%3D19434/report.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/preliminaries/preliminary=3881/matches/match=19438/report.html |title=Montserrat 1â3 Dominican Republic |date=19 March 2000 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071519/http://fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition%3D4395/preliminaries/preliminary%3D3881/matches/match%3D19438/report.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2002, the day of the World Cup Final, Montserrat played [[Bhutan national football team|Bhutan]] in "[[The Other Final]]". The [[exhibition match|friendly match]] between the two lowest-ranked teams in the world ended with a 4â0 win for Bhutan.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/01/sports/plus-soccer-montserrat-loses-to-gain-lowly-title.html|title=Montserrat Loses To Gain Lowly Title|date=1 July 2002|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montserrat again entered the World Cup qualifiers for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 competition]], but were again defeated in the First Qualifying Round, this time losing 0â20 on aggregate to [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda]]. In the first leg at the [[Bermuda National Stadium]] they lost 0â13, which is their heaviest-ever defeat.&lt;ref name="almanack"/&gt; They competed in the [[2005 Caribbean Cup]], but once more failed to progress past the Premilinary Round. They were defeated 1â7 by [[Suriname national football team|Suriname]] in the First Qualifying Round of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/nccamerica/matches/round=250441/match=10000017/report.html|title=Montserrat 1â7 Suriname|publisher=FIFA|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2012, Montserrat achieved their first victory in 17 years, beating the British Virgin Islands 7â0 in a qualifying match for the [[2012 Caribbean Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concacaf.globalsportsmedia.com/page.php?sport=soccer&amp;language_id=us&amp;page=tournament&amp;view=match&amp;match_id=1387786 |title=British Virgin Islands 0â7 Montserrat |date=9 September 2012 |publisher=CONCACAF |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218061113/http://concacaf.globalsportsmedia.com/page.php?sport=soccer&amp;language_id=us&amp;page=tournament&amp;view=match&amp;match_id=1387786 |archivedate=18 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The win, the team's first as a FIFA-affiliated country, came after a run of 21 straight defeats. In total, Montserrat have played 30 international matches. Of these they have lost 26, drawn one and won three, two of those victories coming against Anguilla.&lt;ref name="almanack"/&gt; The poor results of the team has seen them perennially languishing at the lower end of the [[FIFA World Rankings]]. The loss to Bhutan in "The Other Final" saw them fall to #205 in the rankings, becoming the worst-ranked side in the world.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rank"/&gt; In July 2006, they achieved a record high rank of #196.&lt;ref name="rank"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=msr/ranking/gender=m/index.html|title=Montserrat: FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimedia cartography''' is the collection of [[geographical]] information in a manner that allows presentation through various display interfaces.

Through [[multimedia]], [[technology]] allows for differing ways of presenting geographic information. The presentation is intended to expand the channels of [[information]] available to the user from those of paper-based [[map]]s.  Multimedia offers a different way to view [[data]] that has been generated and stored by spatial resource packages.

{{Cannon}}

'''Naval artillery in the [[Age of Sail]]''' encompasses the period of roughly 1571â1862: when large, sail-powered wooden naval warships dominated the high seas, mounting a bewildering variety of different types and sizes of [[cannon]] as their main armament.  By modern standards, these cannon were extremely inefficient, difficult to load, and short ranged.  These characteristics, along with the handling and seamanship of the ships that mounted them, defined the environment in which the [[naval tactics in the Age of Sail]] developed.

==Firing==
[[File:Het Kanonschot - Canon fired (Willem van de Velde II, 1707).jpg|thumb|left|''The cannon shot'' (c. 1680), painted by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]]]] 
[[File:Cannon diagram.svg|thumb|Essential parts of a cannon: 1. the [[projectile]] or cannonball (shot)   2. [[gunpowder]] 3. touch hole (or vent) in which the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] or other ignition device is inserted]]
[[File:Tir.jpg|thumb|left|Firing of an 18-pounder aboard a French ship]]
Firing a naval cannon required a great amount of labour and manpower. The propellant was gunpowder, whose bulk had to be kept in the magazine, a special storage area below deck for safety. ''Powder boys'', typically 10â14 years old, were enlisted to run powder from the magazine up to the gun decks of a vessel as required.

A typical firing procedure follows. A wet swab was used to mop out the interior of the barrel, extinguishing any embers from a previous firing which might set off the next charge of gunpowder prematurely. Gunpowder was placed in the barrel, either loose or in a cloth or parchment cartridge pierced by a metal 'pricker' through the touch hole, and followed by a cloth wad (typically made from canvas and old rope), then rammed home with a rammer. Next the shot was rammed in, followed by another wad to prevent the cannonball from rolling out of the barrel if the muzzle was depressed. The gun in its carriage was then 'run out'; men heaved on the gun tackles until the front of the gun carriage was hard up against the ship's bulwark, the barrel protruding out of the gun port. This took the majority of the gun crew manpower, as the weight of a large cannon in its carriage could total over two tons, and the ship would probably be rolling.

The touch hole in the rear (breech) of the cannon was primed with finer gunpowder (priming powder) or from a quill (from a porcupine or the skin-end of a feather) pre-filled with priming powder, then ignited.

The earlier method of firing a cannon was to apply a [[linstock]]âa wooden staff holding a length of smoldering match at the endâto the touch-hole of the gun. This was dangerous and made accurate shooting difficult from a moving ship, as the gun had to be fired from the side to avoid its recoil, and there was a noticeable delay between the application of the linstock and the gun firing.&lt;ref name=Rodger&gt;{{cite book | last = Rodger | first = Nicholas | title=The Command of the Ocean:A Naval History of Britain 1649-1815 |authorlink= Nicholas Rodger| year=2004 | publisher= Penguin Books| page=420 |isbn = 0-14-028896-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1745, the British began using ''gunlocks'' ([[flintlock mechanism]]s fitted to cannon).

The gunlock, by contrast, was operated by pulling a cord or [[lanyard]]. The gun-captain could stand behind the gun, safely beyond its range of recoil, and sight along the barrel, firing when the roll of the ship lined the gun up with the enemy, and so reduce the chance of the shot hitting the sea or flying high over the enemy's deck.&lt;ref name=Rodger/&gt; Despite their advantages, gunlocks spread gradually as they could not be retrofitted to older guns.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The British adopted them faster than the French, who had still not generally adopted them by the time of the Battle of Trafalgar (1805),&lt;ref name=Rodger /&gt; placing them at a disadvantage, as the new technology was in general use by the Royal Navy at this time. After the introduction of gunlocks, linstocks were retained, but only as a backup means of firing.

The linstock slow match or the spark from the flintlock ignited the priming powder, which in turn set off the main charge, which propelled the shot out of the barrel. When the gun discharged, the recoil sent it backwards until it was stopped by the breech rope, a sturdy rope made fast to ring bolts let into the bulwarks, with a turn taken about the gun's cascabel (the knob at the end of the gun barrel).

A typical broadside of a Royal Navy ship of the late 18th century could be fired 2â3 times in approximately 5 minutes, depending on the training of the crew, a well trained one being essential to the simple yet detailed process of preparing to fire. The British Admiralty did not see fit to provide additional powder to captains to train their crews, generally only allowing {{frac|1|3}} of the powder loaded onto the ship to be fired in the first six months of a typical voyage,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} barring hostile action. Instead of live fire practice, most captains exercised their crews by "running" the guns in and out, performing all the steps associated with firing but without the actual discharge. Some wealthy captains, those who had made money [[Prize money|capturing prizes]] or who came from wealthy families, were known to purchase powder with their own funds to enable their crews to fire real discharges at real targets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Artillery types==
[[File:Antoine Morel-Fatio pl10.jpg|thumb|[[36-pounder long gun]] at the ready. The pointing system and accessories can be seen clearly]]
A complete and accurate listing of the types of naval guns requires analysis both by nation and by time period. The types used by different nations at the same time often were very different, even if they were labelled similarly. The types used by a given nation would shift greatly over time, as technology, tactics, and current weapon fashions changed.

Some types include:
* [[Demi-cannon]]
* [[Culverin]]
* [[Demi-culverin]]
* [[Carronade]]
* [[Paixhans gun]]

One descriptive characteristic which was commonly used was to define guns by their '''pound''' rating â theoretically, the weight of a single solid iron shot fired by that bore of cannon. Common sizes were 42-pounders, [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]], [[32-pounder long gun|32-pounders]], [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]], [[18-pounder long gun|18-pounders]], [[Twelve-pound cannon|12-pounders]], 9-pounders, [[8-pounder long gun|8-pounders]], 6-pounders, and various smaller calibres. French ships used standardized guns of [[36-pounder long gun|36-pound]], 24-pound, 18-pound, [[12-pounder gun|12-pound]], and 8-pound calibers, augmented by carronades and smaller pieces. In general, larger ships carrying more guns carried larger ones as well.

The muzzle-loading design and weight of the iron placed design constraints on the length and size of naval guns. Muzzle-loading required the cannon to be positioned within the hull of the ship for loading. The hull width, guns lining both sides, and hatchways in the centre of the deck also limited the room available. Weight is always a great concern in ship design as it affects speed, stability, and buoyancy. The desire for longer guns for greater range and accuracy, and greater weight of shot for more destructive power, led to some interesting gun designs.

=== Long nine ===
One unique naval gun was the '''long nine'''. It was a proportionately longer-barrelled 9-pounder. It was typically mounted as a bow or stern chaser where it was not perpendicular to the keel, and this also allowed room to operate this longer weapon. In a chase situation, the gun's greater range came into play. However, the desire to reduce weight in the ends of the ship and the relative fragility of the bow and stern portions of the hull limited this role to a 9-pounder, rather than one which used a 12- or 24-pound shot.

=== Carronade ===
{{main|Carronade}}
[[File:HMS Victory 68lb Carronade.png|thumb|left|68-pounder British naval [[carronade]] mounted on [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']]]]
The '''carronade''' was another compromise design. It fired an extremely heavy shot but, to keep down the weight of the gun, it had a very short barrel, giving it shorter range and lesser accuracy. However, at the short range of many naval engagements, these "smashers" were very effective. Their lighter weight and smaller crew requirement allowed them to be used on smaller ships than would otherwise be needed to fire such heavy projectiles. It was used from the 1770s to the 1850s.

===Paixhans gun===
{{main|Paixhans gun}}
[[File:PaixhansCanonImage.jpg|thumb|A [[Paixhans gun]].]]
The [[Paixhans gun]] (French: ''Canon Paixhans'') was the first naval gun using explosive shells. It was developed by French general [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans]] in 1822â1823 by combining the flat trajectory of a gun with an explosive shell that could rip apart and set on fire the bulkheads of enemy warships. The Paixhans gun ultimately doomed the wooden sailship, and forced the introduction of the [[ironclad]] after the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853.

==Shot==
In addition to varying shot weights, different types of shot were employed for various situations:
* [[Round shot]] â Solid spherical cast-iron shot, the standard fare in naval battles.
* [[Canister shot]] â Cans filled with dozens of musket balls. The cans broke open on firing to turn the gun into a giant shotgun for use against enemy personnel.
* [[Grapeshot]] â Canvas-wrapped stacks of smaller round shot which fitted in the barrel, typically three or more layers of three. Some grape shot was made with thin metal or wood disks between the layers, held together by a central bolt. The packages broke open when fired and the balls scattered with deadly effect. Grape was often used against the enemy quarterdeck to kill or injure the officers, or against enemy boarding parties.
* [[Chain-shot]] â Two iron balls joined together with a chain.  This type of shot was particularly effective against [[rigging]], boarding netting, and sails, since the balls and chain would whirl like [[bolas]] when fired.
* Bar shot â Two balls or hemispheres joined by a solid bar. Their effect was similar to chain shot.
* Expanding bar shot â Bar shot connected by a telescoping bar which extended upon firing.
* Link shot â A series of long chain links which unfolded and extended upon firing.
* Langrage â Bags of any junk â scrap metal, bolts, rocks, gravel, old musket balls, etc., fired to injure enemy crews.
* [[Fire arrow]]s â A thick dartlike incendiary projectile with a barbed point, wrapped with pitch-soaked canvas which took fire when the gun was fired. The point stuck in sails, hulls, or spars and set fire to the enemy ship.
* Heated shot â Shore forts sometimes heated iron shot red-hot in a special furnace before loading it (with water-soaked wads to prevent it from setting off the powder charge  prematurely). The hot shot lodging in a ship's dry timbers would set the ship afire. Because of the danger of fire aboard, heated shot were seldom used aboard ships.
* Molten iron shell - A variation on heated shot, where molten metal from a furnace is poured into a hollowed out shell and then allowed to cool briefly to seal the molten metal in before firing. {{HMS|Warrior|1860}} was outfitted to fire molten shells.
* Double shot â Two round shot or other projectiles loaded in one gun and fired at the same time.  Double-shotting lowered the effective range and accuracy of the gun, but could be devastating within '''pistol shot''' range â that is, when ships drew close enough for a pistol shot to reach between the two ships. To avoid bursting the gun, reduced powder charges were used. Guns sometimes were double-shotted with canister or grape on top of ball, or even triple-shotted with very small powder charges which still were enough to cause horrible wounds at close range.
*Exploding shell â Ammunition that worked like a grenade, exploding and sending shrapnel everywhere, either by a burning fuse which was cut to a calculated length depending on the range, or (after 1861) on contact with the target. Shells were often used in mortars, and specialized and reinforced "[[bomb vessel]]s" (often [[ketch]]-rigged so that there was less rigging to obstruct the high-angle mortar shell) were adapted to fire huge mortars for shore bombardment. The "bombs bursting in air" over [[Fort McHenry]] in the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American national anthem]] were this type of projectile.

'''''Pictures from Italy''''' is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] by [[Charles Dickens]], written in 1846. The book reveals the concerns of its author as he presents, according to Kate Flint, the country "like a chaotic magic-lantern show, fascinated both by the spectacle it offers, and by himself as spectator".&lt;ref&gt;Flint, Kate. ''Dickens''. Prentice Hall / Harvester Wheatsheaf, April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1844, Dickens took a respite from writing novels and for several months traveled through France and Italy with his family. They visited the most famous sights: [[Genoa]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]] (with [[Vesuvius]] still smouldering), [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. In his travelogue the author portrays a nation of great contrasts: grandiose buildings and urban desolation, and everyday life beside ancient monuments. But it is his encounters with Italy's colorful street life that capture the imagination. Dickens is particularly drawn to the [[costumes]], [[cross-dressing]], and sheer exuberance of the Roman [[carnival]]. From the book we learn that Dickens was an early riser and walker, and that he enjoyed touring the major attractions on foot.

'''Siá¹guttara Hill''' ({{lang-my|áá­ááºá¹áá¯áá¹áááá¯ááºá¸áá±á¬áº}} {{IPA-my|Î¸Ã¨ÉªÉ´É¡oÊÊtÉÉ¹aÌ° É¡Ã³ÊÉ´dÉÌ|}}; also spelt "'''Theingottara Hill'''") is  a small hill in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma), crowned by the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], the most famous pagoda in the country.

==Legends associated with Singuttara==
===Tapussa and Bhallika===
[[File:Tapussa and Bhallika.jpg|thumb|A painting depicting Tapussa and Bhallika receiving strands of hair from the Buddha.]]
Two pious merchant brothers from the [[Mon people|Mon]] country of Lower Burma, [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Tapussa and Bhallika]] ({{my|ááá¯á¿á ááá¹áá­á}}), met the [[Buddha]] in northern India soon after he had attained enlightenment, and were entrusted with eight sacred hair relics. The two brothers are recorded as the first lay disciples of the Buddha. The Buddha told them the relics should be enshrined in their own land on Singuttara hill, where relics of three previous Buddhas already rested. The Buddha then explained to them the origin of the hill's name: ages before, it was the home of a giant centipede who devoured elephants and piled their tusks ([[Pali]] ''singa'') high (Pali ''uttara'') on the peak. Tupassa and Bhallika would know they had found Singuttara when they found a tree trunk balancing on a peak in such a way that neither end touched the ground.

===The Convention of Sule===
The brothers returned to Lower Burma (Okkalapa) and presented the hairs to the pious King of Okkalapa. Although the King searched diligently for the hill for three years, he was unable to locate it. Eventually [[Åakra (Buddhism)|Sakra]], a deity of Vedic origins, took pity on the king and cleared the jungle from the hill. [[Åakra (Buddhism)|Sakra]] could not, however, identify for Okkalapa the exact spot where the relics were to be enshrined. It was because he was only 36 million years old, and therefore did not remember the visits of the earlier Buddhas (which, according to Buddhist cosmology, happened eons in the past). Okkalapa therefore asked local [[nat (spirit)|nat]]s (spirits) if they could remember. Fortunately the oldest of the nats, [[Sule Pagoda|Sule]], recalled once trying to eat one of the Buddhas. But he had learned the [[Dhamma]] and was no longer a cannibal. Ashamed of his earlier acts and eager to earn merit, Sule led the king and the brothers to the correct spot, the relics were recovered, and the first Shwedagon pagoda was built on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KLAxmR8PZAC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Singuttara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDYMObSDC0&amp;sig=rcQ6pe78lga7r9--g2dLwAy1exM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q6aUSsyHHJLVkAXg--yMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Singuttara&amp;f=false John Strong, "Relics of the Buddha", (Princeton University Press, 2004) p.76ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
The hill is located on the last spur of the [[Pegu Yoma]] (Pegu Mountains), some three kilometers north from the centre of Yangon, and on the western shore of [[Kandawgyi Lake]] (Royal Lake). It is divided into three terraces, the Lower Terrace at road level (ascent of the hill must be made on foot from this point), the Middle Terrace (the beginning of the sacred precinct of the pagoda, beyond which footwear and head coverings are not permitted) and the Top Terrace (the terrace immediately surrounding the main stupa). There are four covered walkways from the road to the top of the hill, one for each cardinal direction. Those on the southern and eastern sides are the most popular entrances to the pagoda. 

Following the British capture of Rangoon in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the hill became a military encampment, a status it retained until the 1920s.

'''Colombia''' has various telephone [[dial plan]]s, depending on the type of service.

==Landline service==

=== Local ===
Local numbers follow the pattern:
*'''NXX-XXXX'''
Where N are numbers from 2 to 8. Numbers where N is 9 are reserved for pay phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calling Colombia|url=http://www.howtocallabroad.com/colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2016}}
And X is any number from 0 to 9.

===Domestic long-distance===
Domestic long-distance numbers follow the pattern:
*'''0AB'''-NXX-XXXX
*'''0AxyB'''-NXX-XXXX
Where A represents one of the four national long-distance carriers, but new long distance operators are using 0Axy format:

:*'''456''' [[Claro Fijos]]
:*'''444''' [[3218278368|Claro Movil]]. codigo
:*3218278368
:*'''414''' [[Tigo]]
:*'''5''' [[UNE (company)|UNE]]
:*'''7''' [[ETB (company)|ETB]]
:*'''9''' [[Movistar]]
And B represents the dialing zone where the number is located. Each [[Departments of Colombia|department]] belongs to only one dialing zone:
:*'''1''' [[BogotÃ¡]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]
:*'''2''' [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]], [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[NariÃ±o Department|NariÃ±o]]
:*'''4''' [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[ChocÃ³ Department|ChocÃ³]] and [[CÃ³rdoba Department|CÃ³rdoba]]
:*'''5''' [[AtlÃ¡ntico Department|AtlÃ¡ntico]], [[BolÃ­var Department|BolÃ­var]], [[Cesar Department|Cesar]], [[Guajira Department|La Guajira]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]] and [[Sucre]]
:*'''6''' [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]] and [[QuindÃ­o Department|QuindÃ­o]]
:*'''7''' [[Norte de Santander Department|Norte de Santander]], [[Santander Department|Santander]] and [[Arauca Department|Arauca]]
:*'''8''' [[BoyacÃ¡ Department|BoyacÃ¡]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], [[Huila Department|Huila]], [[San AndrÃ©s y Providencia Department|San AndrÃ©s]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], [[CaquetÃ¡ Department|CaquetÃ¡]] and the [[Amazonas Department|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco]] departments ([[Casanare Department|Casanare]], [[Vichada Department|Vichada]], [[GuainÃ­a Department|GuainÃ­a]], [[VaupÃ©s Department|VaupÃ©s]], [[Guaviare Department|Guaviare]], [[Amazonas Department|Amazonas]] and [[Putumayo Department|Putumayo]])

===International dialing===
To dial internationally from Colombia, subscribers dial using the pattern:
*'''00A'''-XX...
Where A represents the long-distance carrier, as described above.

==Mobile service==

===Calls to a mobile phone===
Mobile phone numbers follow the pattern:
*'''MMM'''-XXX-XXXX when calling from any mobile phone
*'''03-MMM'''-XXX-XXXX when calling from any landline phone
*'''57-MMM'''-XXX-XXXX when calling from outside Colombia
Where MMM &lt;u&gt;usually&lt;/u&gt; represents the access code for one of the country's mobile phone operators. Since Colombia adopted the [[mobile number portability]], these codes may not be associated with the current operators.
:*'''300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305''' [[Tigo]]
:*'''303''' [[Uff! MÃ³vil]]
:*'''304''' [[UNE Telecomunicaciones|UNE]]
:*'''304, 305''' [[ETB (company)|ETB]]
:*'''305 [[MÃ³vil Ãxito]]
:*'''310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 320, 321, 322,323''' [[Claro Colombia|Claro]] formerly known as Comcel
:*'''315, 316, 317, 318''' [[Movistar]]
:*'''319''' [[Virgin Mobile]]
:*'''350, 351''' [[Avantel]]

===Calls from a mobile phone===
Calls from a mobile phone to a domestic landline phone follow the pattern:
*'''03B'''-NXX-XXXX
Where B corresponds to the dialing zone of the receiving phone.

To dial internationally from a mobile phone, the procedure is identical to calling from a landline phone.

==Toll-free service==
[[Toll-free telephone number|Toll-free]] numbers follow the pattern:
*'''01-800'''-XXX-XXXX&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mintic.gov.co/portal/604/w3-article-14675.html] Article 48 of Decree 25 of January 11, 2002, Ministry of Communications of Colombia, retrieved on April 7 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2002, the format was '''9800'''-XXXXXX. When the current format was adopted in that year, existing toll-free numbers were given the format '''01-800-0'''XX-XXXX. These numbers were advertised with the grouping '''01-8000'''-XX-XXX, leading many people to erroneously believe that the general prefix for toll-free numbers is '''01-8000'''.

==Other services==

===Toll-based service===
*'''01-900'''-XXX-XXXX
*'''01-901'''-XXX-XXXX

===Dial-up Internet service billed per minute===
*'''01-947'''-XXX-XXXX
*'''01-948'''-XXX-XXXX

===Emergency numbers===
*'''1-2-3''', for all emergency services.
*'''1-1-2''', for only ''[[National Police of Colombia|Police]]'' services.
*'''1-1-9''', for only ''Firefighting'' services.
*'''1-3-2''', for only ''Ambulance'' services.

'''Tides''' are the rise and fall of [[sea level]]s caused by the combined effects of the [[gravity|gravitational]] forces exerted by the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]], and the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of [[Earth]].

[[Tide table]]s can be used to find the predicted times and amplitude (or "[[tidal range]]") of tides at any given locale. The predictions are influenced by many factors including the alignment of the Sun and Moon, the [[Tide#Phase and amplitude|phase and amplitude of the tide]] (pattern of tides in the deep ocean), the [[amphidromic]] systems of the oceans, and the shape of the coastline and near-shore [[bathymetry]] (see ''[[Tide#Timing|Timing]]'').  They are however only predictions, the actual time and height of the tide is affected by wind and atmospheric pressure.  Some shorelines experience a [[semi-diurnal]] tideâtwo nearly equal high and low tides each day. Other locations experience a [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] tideâonly one high and low tide each day. A "mixed tide"âtwo uneven tides a day, or one high and one lowâis also possible.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book

Tides vary on timescales ranging from hours to years due to a number of factors, which determine the [[lunitidal interval]]. To make accurate records, [[tide gauge]]s at fixed stations measure water level over time. Gauges ignore variations caused by waves with periods shorter than minutes. These data are compared to the reference (or datum) level usually called [[mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Do not confuse with the astronomical [[lunar day]] on the Moon. A lunar zenith is the Moon's highest point in the sky.&lt;/ref&gt;

While tides are usually the largest source of short-term sea-level fluctuations, sea levels are also subject to forces such as wind and barometric pressure changes, resulting in [[storm surge]]s, especially in shallow seas and near coasts.

Tidal phenomena are not limited to the oceans, but can occur in other systems whenever a gravitational field that varies in time and space is present. For example, the shape of the solid part of the Earth is affected slightly by [[Earth tide]], though this is not as easily seen as the water tidal movements.

Tide changes proceed via the following stages:
* Sea level rises over several hours, covering the [[intertidal zone]]; '''flood tide'''.
* The water rises to its highest level, reaching '''high tide'''.
* Sea level falls over several hours, revealing the intertidal zone; '''ebb tide'''.
* The water stops falling, reaching '''low tide'''.

Oscillating currents produced by tides are known as tidal streams. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called [[slack water]] or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and is said to be turning. '''Slack water''' usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Tides are commonly ''semi-diurnal'' (two high waters and two low waters each day), or ''diurnal'' (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters on a given day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the ''higher high water'' and the ''lower high water'' in [[tide table]]s. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the ''higher low water'' and the ''lower low water''. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;Tide tables usually list ''mean lower low water'' (mllw, the 19 year average of mean lower low waters), ''mean higher low water'' (mhlw), ''mean lower high water'' (mlhw), ''mean higher high water'' (mhhw), as well as ''perigean tides''. These are ''mean'' values in the sense that they derive from mean data.{{cite web

===Definitions===
From the highest level to the lowest:
* '''Highest astronomical tide''' ('''HAT''') â The highest tide which can be predicted to occur.  Note that meteorological conditions may add extra height to the HAT.
* '''Mean high water springs''' ('''MHWS''') â The average of the two high tides on the days of spring tides.
* '''Mean high water neaps''' ('''MHWN''') â The average of the two high tides on the days of neap tides.
* '''Mean sea level''' ('''MSL''') â This is the average sea level.  The MSL is constant for any location over a long period.
* '''Mean low water neaps''' ('''MLWN''') â The average of the two low tides on the days of neap tides.
* '''Mean low water springs''' ('''MLWS''') â The average of the two low tides on the days of spring tides.
* '''Lowest astronomical tide''' ('''LAT''') and '''Chart Datum''' ('''CD''') â The lowest tide which can be predicted to occur.  Modern charts use this as the chart datum.  Note that under certain meteorological conditions the water may fall lower than this meaning that there is less water than shown on charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of tidal terms|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tidal-intro/definitions|website=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tidal constituents== &lt;!-- [[tidal constituent]] and [[tidal constituents]] redirect here --&gt;

'''Tidal constituents''' are the net result of multiple influences impacting tidal changes over certain periods of time.  Primary constituents include the Earth's rotation, the position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the Moon's altitude (elevation) above the Earth's Equator, and [[bathymetry]].  Variations with periods of less than half a day are called ''harmonic constituents''. Conversely, cycles of days, months, or years are referred to as ''long period'' constituents.

Tidal forces [[Earth tide|affect the entire earth]], but the movement of solid Earth occurs by mere centimeters.  In contrast, the atmosphere is much more fluid and compressible so its surface moves by kilometers, in the sense of the contour level of a particular low pressure in the outer atmosphere.
{{see also|Earth tide#Tidal constituents}}

===Principal lunar semi-diurnal constituent===
In most locations, the largest constituent is the "principal lunar semi-diurnal", also known as the ''M2'' (or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tidal constituent. Its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a ''tidal lunar day'', which is the average time separating one lunar [[zenith]] from the next, and thus is the time required for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. Simple [[tide clock]]s track this constituent. The lunar day is longer than the Earth day because the Moon orbits in the same direction the Earth spins. This is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05Â½ (not at 1:00).

The Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a dayâabout 24 hours and 50 minutesâfor the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead ([[culmination]]) once and underfoot once (at an [[hour angle]] of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to [[zenith]] or [[nadir]], but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.

Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to "stretch" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibriumâthere is never time for the fluid to "catch up" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constantâthe changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

When there are two high tides each day with different heights (and two low tides also of different heights), the pattern is called a ''mixed semi-diurnal tide''.&lt;ref name=noaa7&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Tidal range}}
{{anchor|springtide}}The semi-diurnal range (the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day) varies in a two-week cycle. Approximately twice a month, around [[new moon]] and [[full moon]] when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a configuration known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The tide's range is then at its maximum; this is called the '''spring tide'''. It is not named after the [[Spring (season)|season]], but, like that word, derives from the meaning "jump, burst forth, rise", as in a natural [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].

When the Moon is at [[Gibbous|first quarter]] or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90Â° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the '''neap tide''', or '''neaps'''.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "without the power", as in ''forÃ°ganges nip'' (forth-going without-the-power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|neapÂ²}} Old English (example given from AD 469: ''forÃ°ganges nip'' - without the power of advancing).  The Danish ''niptid'' is probably from the English.  The English term neap-flood (from which neap tide comes) seems to have been in common use by AD 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, '[[slack water]]' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.

===Other constituents===
These include solar gravitational effects, the obliquity (tilt) of the Earth's Equator and rotational axis, the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit and the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit of the Sun.

A compound tide (or overtide) results from the shallow-water interaction of its two parent waves.&lt;ref name="leprovost"&gt;Le Provost, Christian (1991).

The curved arcs around the amphidromic points show the direction of the tides, each indicating a synchronized 6-hour period. Tidal ranges generally increase with increasing distance from amphidromic points. Tide waves move around these points, generally counterclockwise in the N. Hemisphere and clockwise in the S.

&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Map showing relative tidal magnitudes of different ocean areas]]
Because the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tidal constituent dominates in most locations, the stage or ''phase'' of a tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360Â° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called ''cotidal lines'', which are analogous to [[contour lines]] of constant altitude on [[topographical maps]]. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.

For an ocean in the shape of a circular basin enclosed by a coastline, the ''cotidal lines'' point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the [[amphidromic point]]. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by ''zero'' tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, [[Iceland]] and [[Madagascar]].) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant ''amplitude'' (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation, caused by the [[Coriolis effect]], is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the ''epoch''. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent "equilibrium tide" on a landless Earth measured at 0Â° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schureman|first=Paul|title=Manual of harmonic analysis and prediction of tides|date=1971|publisher=U.S. Coast and geodetic survey|page=204|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ia/manualofharmonic00schu#page/220/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North Atlantic, because the cotidal lines circulate counterclockwise around the amphidromic point, the high tide passes New York Harbor approximately an hour ahead of Norfolk Harbor. South of Cape Hatteras the tidal forces are more complex, and cannot be predicted reliably based on the North Atlantic cotidal lines.

===History of tidal physics===
Investigation into tidal physics was important in the early development of [[celestial mechanics]], with the existence of two daily tides being explained by the Moon's gravity. Later the daily tides were explained more precisely by the interaction of the Moon's and the Sun's gravity.

[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] theorized around 150 B.C. that tides were caused by the Moon. The influence of the Moon on bodies of water was also mentioned in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy with Frank E. Robbins, trans., ''Tetrabiblos'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1940), Book 1, chapter 2.  From chapter 2:  "The moon, too, as the heavenly body nearest the earth, bestows her effluence most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her; the rivers increase and diminish their streams with her light, the seas turn their own tides with her rising and setting, â¦ "&lt;/ref&gt;.

In ''De temporum ratione'' (''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'') of 725 [[Bede]] linked semidurnal tides and the phenomenon of varying tidal heights to the Moon and its phases.  Bede starts by noting that the tides rise and fall 4/5 of an hour later each day, just as the Moon rises and sets 4/5 of an hour later.&lt;ref name=Wallis&gt;{{cite book|author=Bede|authorlink=Bede|translator-last=Wallis|translator-first=Faith|title=The Reckoning of Time|year=1999|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=0-85323-693-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=1 June 2018|p=82|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to emphasise that in two lunar months (59 days) the Moon circles the Earth 57 times and there are 114 tides.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=83}}  Bede then observes that the height of a tides varies over the month.  Increasing tides are called ''malinae'' and decreasing tides ''ledones'' and that the month is divided into  four parts of seven or eight days with alternating ''malinae'' and ''ledones''.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=84}}  In the same passage he also notes the effect of winds to hold back tides.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=84}}

Medieval understanding of the tides was primarily based on works of [[Muslim astronomers]], which became available through [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translation]] starting from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Tolmacheva&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 9781135459321| editor-last1 = Glick| editor-first1 = Thomas F.| work = Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia| date = 2014-01-27 | title=Geography, Chorography | page=188 | author=Marina Tolmacheva}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Ma'shar]] (d. circa 886), in his ''Introductorium in astronomiam'', taught that ebb and flood tides were caused by the Moon.&lt;ref name=Tolmacheva /&gt; Abu Ma'shar discussed the effects of wind and Moon's phases relative to the Sun on the tides.&lt;ref name=Tolmacheva /&gt; In the 12th century, [[al-Bitruji]] (d. circa 1204) contributed the notion that the tides were caused by the general circulation of the heavens.&lt;ref name=Tolmacheva /&gt;

[[Simon Stevin]] in his 1608 ''De spiegheling der Ebbenvloet'', The theory of ebb and flood, dismissed  a large number of misconceptions that still existed about ebb and flood. Stevin pleaded for the idea that the attraction of the Moon was responsible for the tides and spoke in clear terms about ebb, flood, [[spring tide]] and [[neap tide]], stressing that further research needed to be made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/224466.pdf Simon Stevin - Flanders Marine Institute] (pdf, in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmerino, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5lkdlMPi1AC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=%22johannes+kepler%22+%22simon+stevin%22+ebb+flood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YXUszazjTC&amp;sig=_Dh5OmbnwPKfoHfwVpreNLbJxV8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dPKKU5uoKMasPcmdgPgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johannes%20kepler%22%20%22simon%20stevin%22%20ebb%20flood&amp;f=false The Reception of the Galilean Science of Motion in Seventeenth-Century Europe, pp. 200] op books.google.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609 [[Johannes Kepler]] also correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon caused the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova'' â¦ (1609), p. 5 of the ''Introductio in hoc opus'' (Introduction to this work).  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/n24/mode/1up From page 5:]  ''"Orbis virtutis tractoriÃ¦, quÃ¦ est in Luna, porrigitur utque ad Terras, &amp; prolectat aquas sub Zonam Torridam, â¦ Celeriter vero Luna verticem transvolante, cum aquÃ¦ tam celeriter sequi non possint, fluxus quidem fit Oceani sub Torrida in Occidentem, â¦ "'' (The sphere of the lifting power, which is [centered] in the moon, is extended as far as to the earth and attracts the waters under the torrid zone, â¦ However the moon flies swiftly across the zenith ; because the waters cannot follow so quickly, the tide of the ocean under the torrid [zone] is indeed made to the west, â¦ )&lt;/ref&gt; which he based upon ancient observations and correlations.

[[Galileo Galilei]] in his 1632 ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', whose working title was ''Dialogue on the Tides'', gave an explanation of the tides. The resulting theory, however, was incorrect as he attributed the tides to the sloshing of water caused by the Earth's movement around the Sun. He hoped to provide mechanical proof of the Earth's movement. The value of his tidal theory is disputed. Galileo rejected Kepler's explanation of the tides.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1642â1727) was the first person to explain tides as the product of the gravitational attraction of astronomical masses. His explanation of the tides (and many other phenomena) was published in the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1687)&lt;ref name=slc-ch2&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] to explain the lunar and solar attractions as the origin of the tide-generating forces.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, in the 'Principia' (Book 1) (1729 translation), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA251 Corollaries 19 and 20 to Proposition 66, on pages 251â254], referring back to page 234 et seq.; and in Book 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA255 Propositions 24, 36 and 37, starting on page 255].&lt;/ref&gt;
Newton and others before [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] worked the problem from the perspective of a static system (equilibrium theory), that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non-inertial ocean evenly covering the whole Earth.&lt;ref name=slc-ch2 /&gt; The tide-generating force (or its corresponding [[scalar potential|potential]]) is still relevant to tidal theory, but as an intermediate quantity (forcing function) rather than as a final result; theory must also consider the Earth's accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces, which response is influenced by ocean depth, the Earth's rotation, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1740, the [[AcadÃ©mie Royale des Sciences]] in Paris offered a prize for the best theoretical essay on tides. [[Daniel Bernoulli]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Colin Maclaurin]] and [[Antoine Cavalleri]] shared the prize.&lt;ref name="EulerAiton1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonhard Euler|author2=Eric J. Aiton|title=Commentationes mechanicae et astronomicae ad physicam pertinentes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1yCADlGTkgC&amp;pg=PR19|date=28 June 1996|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7643-1459-0|pages=19â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclaurin used Newton's theory to show that a smooth sphere covered by a sufficiently deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a [[prolate]] spheroid (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth's [[Coriolis effect|rotational effects]] on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force's ''horizontal'' component (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.

In 1770 [[James Cook]]'s [[barque]] [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']] grounded on the [[Great Barrier Reef]].  Attempts were made to refloat her on the following tide which failed, but the tide after that lifted her clear with ease.  Whilst she was being repaired in the mouth of the [[Endeavour River]] Cook observed the tides over a period of seven weeks.  At neap tides both tides in a day were similar, but at springs the tides rose {{convert|7|feet}} in the morning but {{convert|9|feet}} in the evening.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal

Pierre-Simon Laplace formulated a system of [[partial differential equation]]s relating the ocean's horizontal flow to its surface height, the first major dynamic theory for water tides. The [[Laplace's tidal equations|Laplace tidal equations]] are still in use today. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], rewrote Laplace's equations in terms of [[vorticity]] which allowed for solutions describing tidally driven coastally trapped waves, known as [[Kelvin wave]]s.&lt;ref name="tidhist"&gt;{{cite journal

===Forces===
The [[tidal force]] produced by a massive object (Moon, hereafter) on a small particle located on or in an extensive body (Earth, hereafter) is the vector difference between the gravitational force exerted by the Moon on the particle, and the gravitational force that would be exerted on the particle if it were located at the Earth's center of mass. 

Whereas the [[gravitational force]] subjected by a celestial body on Earth varies inversely as the square of its distance to the Earth, the maximal tidal force varies inversely as, approximately, the cube of this distance.&lt;ref&gt;Young, C.A. 1889. ''A Textbook of General Astronomy'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37275/37275-pdf.pdf] Page 288.&lt;/ref&gt; If the tidal force caused by each body were instead equal to its full gravitational force (which is not the case due to the [[free fall]] of the whole Earth, not only the oceans, towards these bodies) a different pattern of tidal forces would be observed, e.g. with a much stronger influence from the Sun than from the Moon: The solar gravitational force on the Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The solar tidal force is 46% as large as the lunar.&lt;!-- numbers double-checked by User:JEBrown87544, 03 Jan 2007 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961029b.html NASA] the lunar tidal force is 2.21 times larger than the solar.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the MoonâEarth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 1.1 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;â7&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', while the solar tidal acceleration (along the SunâEarth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 0.52 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;â7&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', where ''g'' is the [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration]] at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tidal force#Mathematical treatment|Tidal force â Mathematical treatment]] and sources cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Venus has the largest effect of the other planets, at 0.000113 times the solar effect. The system of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun is an example of a [[three-body problem]], and there is no exact mathematical [[closed-form expression]] of their interdependence.

[[File:Field tidal.svg|thumb|The lunar [[gravity]] differential [[Vector field|field]] at the Earth's surface is known as the [[Tidal force|tide-generating force]]. This is the primary mechanism that drives tidal action and explains two equipotential tidal bulges, accounting for two daily high waters.|alt=Diagram showing a circle with closely spaced arrows pointing away from the reader on the left and right sides, while pointing towards the user on the top and bottom.]]

The ocean's surface is closely approximated by an equipotential surface, (ignoring ocean currents) commonly referred to as the [[geoid]]. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's [[gradient]], there are no [[tangent]]ial forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.

===Laplace's tidal equations===
Ocean depths are much smaller than their horizontal extent. Thus, the response to tidal forcing can be [[Model (abstract)|modelled]] using the [[Laplace's tidal equations|Laplace tidal equations]] which incorporate the following features:

# The vertical (or radial) velocity is negligible, and there is no vertical [[wind shear|shear]]âthis is a sheet flow.
# The forcing is only horizontal ([[tangent]]ial).
# The [[Coriolis effect]] appears as an inertial force (fictitious) acting laterally to the direction of flow and proportional to velocity.
# The surface height's rate of change is proportional to the negative divergence of velocity multiplied by the depth. As the horizontal velocity stretches or compresses the ocean as a sheet, the volume thins or thickens, respectively.

The boundary conditions dictate no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom.

The Coriolis effect (inertial force) steers flows moving towards the Equator to the west and flows moving away from the Equator toward the east, allowing coastally trapped waves. Finally, a dissipation term can be added which is an analog to viscosity.

===Amplitude and cycle time===
The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about {{convert|54|cm|in}} at the highest point, which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth, there were no landmasses, and the Earth were rotating in step with the Moon's orbit. The Sun similarly causes tides, of which the theoretical amplitude is about {{convert|25|cm|in}} (46% of that of the Moon) with a cycle time of 12 hours. At spring tide the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of {{convert|79|cm|in}}, while at neap tide the theoretical level is reduced to {{convert|29|cm|in}}. Since the orbits of the Earth about the Sun, and the Moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying EarthâSun and EarthâMoon distances. This causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about Â±18% for the Moon and Â±5% for the Sun. If both the Sun and Moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon, the theoretical amplitude would reach {{convert|93|cm|in}}.

Real amplitudes differ considerably, not only because of depth variations and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the Equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth's [[lithosphere]] has a natural period of about 57 minutes). [[Earth tide]]s, which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide's own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean's response to tidal forces.

===Dissipation===
{{See also|Tidal acceleration}}
&lt;!--this seems misleading in terms of the oceanography. Is this global average? Cites please!: Because the lunar tidal forces drive the oceans with a period of about 12.42 hours, which is considerably less than the natural period of the oceans, complex resonance phenomena take place. This, as well as the effects of friction, gives rise to an average lag time of 11 minutes between the occurrence of high water and lunar zenith. This tidal lag time corresponds to an angle of about 3 degrees between the position of the Moon, the center of the Earth, and the location of the global average high water.

Regarding the EarthâMoon system by itself (excluding the sun for the moment) unless both bodies' spin axes align perpendicularly to the orbital plane, oscillations result. Such oscillations contribute to tidal dissipation.

Dissipation by internal fluctuating deformations of the Earth due to the lunar tidal force is small compared with the dissipation in the Earth's oceans and seas, which account for 98% of the reduction of the Earth's rotational energy.&lt;ref name=Ray1996&gt;{{Cite journal

Dissipation arises as basin-scale tidal flows drive smaller-scale flows which experience turbulent dissipation. This tidal drag creates torque on the moon that gradually transfers angular momentum to its orbit, and a gradual increase in Earthâmoon separation. The equal and opposite torque on the Earth correspondingly decreases its rotational velocity. Thus, over geologic time, the moon recedes from the Earth, at about {{convert|3.8|cm|in}}/year, lengthening the terrestrial day.&lt;ref&gt;The day is currently lengthening at a rate of about 0.002 seconds per century.

[[Tidal acceleration|Day length has increased]] by about 2 hours in the last 600 million years. Assuming (as a crude approximation) that the deceleration rate has been constant, this would imply that 70 million years ago, day length was on the order of 1% shorter with about 4 more days per year.

===Bathymetry===
[[File:Gorey Harbour at low tide.JPG|thumb|The harbour of [[Gorey, Jersey]] falls dry at low tide.]]
The shape of the shoreline and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, so there is no simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater [[bathymetry]] and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] and the time of high or low tide (the [[lunitidal interval]]) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], U.S., predictably occurs approximately two and a half hours before the Moon passes directly overhead.

Land masses and ocean basins act as barriers against water moving freely around the globe, and their varied shapes and sizes affect the size of tidal frequencies. As a result, tidal patterns vary. For example, in the U.S., the East coast has predominantly semi-diurnal tides, as do Europe's Atlantic coasts, while the West coast predominantly has mixed tides.&lt;ref name=noaa7b&gt;U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (Education section), [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/tides/media/supp_tide07b.html map showing world distribution of tide patterns], semi-diurnal, diurnal and mixed semi-diurnal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From ancient times, tidal observation and discussion has increased in  sophistication, first marking the daily recurrence, then tides' relationship to the Sun and moon. [[Pytheas]] travelled to the [[British Isles]] about 325 BC and seems to be the first to have related spring tides to the phase of the moon.

In the 2nd century BC, the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomer]], [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], correctly described the phenomenon of tides in order to support his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He correctly theorized that tides were caused by the [[moon]], although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the [[pneuma]]. He noted that tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to link tides to the lunar attraction, and that the height of the tides depends on the moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historia'']] of [[Pliny the Elder]] collates many tidal observations, e.g., the spring tides are a few days after (or before) new and full moon and are highest around the equinoxes, though Pliny noted many relationships now regarded as fanciful. In his ''Geography'', Strabo described tides in the [[Persian Gulf]] having their greatest range when the moon was furthest from the plane of the Equator. All this despite the relatively small amplitude of [[Mediterranean]] basin tides. (The strong currents through the [[Euripus Strait]] and the [[Strait of Messina]] puzzled [[Aristotle]].) [[Philostratus]] discussed tides in Book Five of ''The Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]''. Philostratus mentions the moon, but attributes tides to "spirits". In Europe around 730 AD, the Venerable [[Bede]] described how the rising tide on one coast of the British Isles coincided with the fall on the other and described the time progression of high water along the Northumbrian coast.

The first [[tide table]] in [[China]] was recorded in 1056 AD primarily for visitors wishing to see the famous [[tidal bore]] in the [[Qiantang River]]. The first known British tide table is thought to be that of John Wallingford, who died Abbot of St. Albans in 1213, based on high water occurring 48 minutes later each day, and three hours earlier at the [[Thames]] mouth than upriver at [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, D.E. (1999). ''Tides, A Scientific History'': 11, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] led the first systematic [[harmonic analysis]] of tidal records starting in 1867. The main result was the building of a [[tide-predicting machine]] using a system of pulleys to add together six harmonic time functions. It was "programmed" by resetting gears and chains to adjust phasing and amplitudes. Similar machines were used until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first known sea-level record of an entire springâneap cycle was made in 1831 on the Navy Dock in the [[Thames Estuary]]. Many large ports had automatic tide gauge stations by 1850.

[[William Whewell]] first mapped co-tidal lines ending with a nearly global chart in 1836. In order to make these maps consistent, he hypothesized the existence of amphidromes where co-tidal lines meet in the mid-ocean. These points of no tide were confirmed by measurement in 1840 by Captain Hewett, RN, from careful soundings in the North Sea.&lt;ref name="tidhist"/&gt;

===Timing===
[[File:Diurnal tide types map.jpg|thumb|The same tidal forcing has different results depending on many factors, including coast orientation, continental shelf margin, water body dimensions.|alt=World map showing the location of diurnal, semi-diurnal, and mixed semi-diurnal tides. The European and African west coasts are exclusively semi-diurnal, and North America's West coast is mixed semi-diurnal, but elsewhere the different patterns are highly intermixed, although a given pattern may cover {{convert|200|-|2000|km|mi}}.]]
The tidal forces due to the Moon and Sun generate very long  waves which travel all around the ocean following the paths shown in [[Tide#Phase and amplitude|co-tidal charts]]. The time when the crest of the wave reaches a port then gives the time of high water at the port. The time taken for the wave to travel around the ocean also means that there is a delay between the phases of the Moon and their effect on the tide. Springs and neaps in the [[North Sea]], for example, are two days behind the new/full moon and first/third quarter moon. This is called the tide's ''age''.&lt;ref&gt;

The ocean [[bathymetry]] greatly influences the tide's exact time and height at a particular [[coast]]al point. There are some extreme cases; the [[Bay of Fundy]], on the east coast of Canada, is often stated to have the world's highest tides because of its shape, bathymetry, and its distance from the continental shelf edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Southampton]] in the United Kingdom has a double high water caused by the interaction between the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tidal constituents.&lt;ref name=Pingree_1978&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingree|first=R.D.|author2=L. Maddock|title=Deep-Sea Research|year=1978|volume=25|pages=53â63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] has double low waters for the same reason.  The ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tide is found all along the south coast of the United Kingdom, but its effect is most noticeable between the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] because the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide is lowest in this region.

Because the oscillation modes of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] do not coincide with any significant astronomical forcing period, the largest tides are close to their narrow connections with the Atlantic Ocean. Extremely small tides also occur for the same reason in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Sea of Japan]]. Elsewhere, as along the southern coast of [[Australia]], low tides can be due to the presence of a nearby [[Amphidromic point|amphidrome]].

===Analysis===
[[File:Water surface level changes with tides.svg|thumb|A regular water level chart]]
[[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of gravitation first enabled an explanation of why there were generally two tides a day, not one, and offered hope for a detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior. Although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings, the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated by the body of water over many days. In addition, accurate results would require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basinsâtheir [[bathymetry]], and coastline shape.

Current procedure for analysing tides follows the method of harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson]]. It is based on the principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of Sun and Moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality.  At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured for a period of time sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component.  Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.

The main patterns in the tides are
* the twice-daily variation
* the difference between the first and second tide of a day
* the springâneap cycle
* the annual variation
The ''Highest Astronomical Tide'' is the perigean spring tide when both the Sun and Moon are closest to the Earth.

When confronted by a periodically varying function, the standard approach is to employ [[Fourier series]], a form of analysis that uses [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al functions as a ''basis'' set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle. These multiples are called ''harmonics'' of the fundamental frequency, and the process is termed [[harmonic analysis]]. If the basis set of sinusoidal functions suit the behaviour being modelled, relatively few harmonic terms need to be added. Orbital paths are very nearly circular, so sinusoidal variations are suitable for tides.

For the analysis of tide heights, the Fourier series approach has in practice to be made more elaborate than the use of a single frequency and its harmonics.  The tidal patterns are decomposed into many sinusoids having many fundamental frequencies, corresponding (as in the [[Lunar theory#Results of the theories|lunar theory]]) to many different combinations of the motions of the Earth, the Moon, and the angles that define the shape and location of their orbits.

For tides, then, ''harmonic analysis'' is not limited to harmonics of a single frequency.&lt;ref&gt;To demonstrate this [http://www.arachnoid.com/tides/index.html Tides Home Page] offers a tidal height pattern converted into an ''.mp3'' sound file, and the rich sound is quite different from a pure tone.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the harmonies are multiples of many fundamental frequencies, not just of the fundamental frequency of the simpler Fourier series approach.  Their representation as a Fourier series having only one fundamental frequency and its (integer) multiples would require many terms, and would be severely limited in the time-range for which it would be valid.

The study of tide height by harmonic analysis was begun by Laplace, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and [[George Darwin]]. [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A.T. Doodson]] extended their work, introducing the ''Doodson Number'' notation to organise the hundreds of resulting terms. This approach has been the international standard ever since, and the complications arise as follows: the tide-raising force is notionally given by sums of several terms. Each term is of the form
: &lt;math&gt; A \cos\,(\omega t + p) &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} is the amplitude, {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/var&gt;}} is the angular frequency usually given in degrees per hour corresponding to {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} measured in hours, and {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} is the phase offset with regard to the astronomical state at time ''t'' = 0&amp;nbsp;. There is one term for the Moon and a second term for the Sun. The phase {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} of the first harmonic for the Moon term is called the [[lunitidal interval]] or high water interval. The next step is to accommodate the harmonic terms due to the elliptical shape of the orbits. Accordingly, the value of {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} is not a constant but also varying with time, slightly, about some average figure. Replace it then by {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} where A is another sinusoid, similar to the cycles and epicycles of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic theory]]. Accordingly,
: &lt;math&gt; A(t) = A\bigl(1 + A_a \cos\,(\omega_a t + p_a)\bigr) &lt;/math&gt;
which is to say an average value {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} with a sinusoidal variation about it of magnitude {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, with frequency {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and phase {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}. Thus the simple term is now the product of two cosine factors:
: &lt;math&gt; A \bigl[ 1 + A_a \cos\,(\omega_a t + p_a)\bigr] \cos\,(\omega t + p) &lt;/math&gt;

Given that for any {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;}}
: &lt;math&gt;\cos x \cos y = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} \cos\,( x + y ) + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} \cos\,( x - y )&lt;/math&gt;
it is clear that a compound term involving the product of two cosine terms each with their own frequency is the same as ''three'' simple cosine terms that are to be added at the original frequency and also at frequencies which are the sum and difference of the two frequencies of the product term. (Three, not two terms, since the whole expression is &lt;math&gt;(1 + \cos x)\cos y&lt;/math&gt;.) Consider further that the tidal force on a location depends also on whether the Moon (or the Sun) is above or below the plane of the Equator, and that these attributes have their own periods also incommensurable with a day and a month, and it is clear that many combinations result. With a careful choice of the basic astronomical frequencies, the Doodson Number annotates the particular additions and differences to form the frequency of each simple cosine term.

Remember that astronomical tides do ''not'' include weather effects. Also, changes to local conditions (sandbank movement, dredging harbour mouths, etc.) away from those prevailing at the measurement time affect the tide's actual timing and magnitude. Organisations quoting a "highest astronomical tide" for some location may exaggerate the figure as a safety factor against analytical uncertainties, distance from the nearest measurement point, changes since the last observation time, ground subsidence, etc., to avert liability should an engineering work be overtopped. Special care is needed when assessing the size of a "weather surge" by subtracting the astronomical tide from the observed tide.

Careful Fourier [[data analysis]] over a nineteen-year period (the ''National Tidal Datum Epoch'' in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the ''tidal harmonic constituents''. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, Moon and Sun's relative positions repeat almost exactly in the [[Metonic cycle]] of 19&amp;nbsp;years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal [[Earth tide#Tidal constituents|tidal constituent]]. This analysis can be done using only the knowledge of the forcing ''period'', but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

|date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12&amp;nbsp;hours (the ''semi-diurnal'' constituents), but there are major constituents near 24&amp;nbsp;hours (''diurnal'') as well. Longer term constituents are 14&amp;nbsp;day or ''fortnightly'', monthly, and semiannual. Semi-diurnal tides dominated coastline, but some areas such as the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(lunar) and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14&amp;nbsp;day period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/harmonic_cons_defs.html Harmonic Constituents], [[NOAA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plot above, each cotidal line differs by one hour from its neighbors, and the thicker lines show tides in phase with equilibrium at Greenwich. The lines rotate around the [[amphidromic point]]s counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere so that from [[Baja California Peninsula]] to [[Alaska]] and from [[France]] to [[Ireland]] the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide propagates northward. In the southern hemisphere this direction is clockwise. On the other hand, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide propagates counterclockwise around New Zealand, but this is because the islands act as a dam and permit the tides to have different heights on the islands' opposite sides. (The tides do propagate northward on the east side and southward on the west coast, as predicted by theory.)

The exception is at [[Cook Strait]] where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water. This is because cotidal lines 180Â° around the amphidromes are in opposite phase, for example high water across from low water at each end of Cook Strait. Each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes, phases, and amphidromic points, so the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; patterns cannot be used for other tide components.

Nelson has two monthly spring tides, while Napier and Wellington each have one.]]

Because the Moon is moving in its orbit around the Earth and in the same sense as the Earth's rotation, a point on the Earth must rotate slightly further to catch up so that the time between semidiurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hoursâa bit over twenty-five minutes extra. The two peaks are not equal. The two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), higher high (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.

When the Earth, Moon, and Sun are in line (SunâEarthâMoon, or SunâMoonâEarth) the two main influences combine to produce spring tides; when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle MoonâEarthâSun is close to ninety degrees, neap tides result. As the Moon moves around its orbit it changes from north of the Equator to south of the Equator. The alternation in high tide heights becomes smaller, until they are the same (at the lunar equinox, the Moon is above the Equator), then redevelop but with the other polarity, waxing to a maximum difference and then waning again.

===Current===
The tides' influence on current flow is much more difficult to analyse, and data is much more difficult to collect. A tidal height is a simple number which applies to a wide region simultaneously. A flow has both a magnitude and a direction, both of which can vary substantially with depth and over short distances due to local bathymetry. Also, although a water channel's center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways. A flow proceeding up a curved channel is the same flow, even though its direction varies continuously along the channel. Surprisingly, flood and ebb flows are often not in opposite directions. Flow direction is determined by the upstream channel's shape, not the downstream channel's shape. Likewise, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] may form in only one flow direction.

Nevertheless, current analysis is similar to tidal analysis: in the simple case, at a given location the flood flow is in mostly one direction, and the ebb flow in another direction. Flood velocities are given positive sign, and ebb velocities negative sign. Analysis proceeds as though these are tide heights.

In more complex situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the ebb and flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.

Tide flow information is most commonly seen on [[nautical chart]]s, presented as a table of flow speeds and bearings at hourly intervals, with separate tables for spring and neap tides. The timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, though it may be far away.

As with tide height predictions, tide flow predictions based only on astronomical factors do not incorporate weather conditions, which can ''completely'' change the outcome.

The tidal flow through [[Cook Strait]] between the two main islands of New Zealand is particularly interesting, as the tides on each side of the strait are almost exactly out of phase, so that one side's high water is simultaneous with the other's low water. Strong currents result, with almost zero tidal height change in the strait's center. Yet, although the tidal surge normally flows in one direction for six hours and in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions, the reverse surge might be entirely overcome so that the flow continues in the same direction through three or more surge periods.

A further complication for Cook Strait's flow pattern is that the tide at the north side (e.g. at [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]) follows the common bi-weekly springâneap tide cycle (as found along the west side of the country), but the south side's tidal pattern has only ''one'' cycle per month, as on the east side: [[Wellington]], and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]].

The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows separately the high water and low water height and time, through November 2007; these are ''not'' measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's nautical chart offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41Â°13Â·9âS 174Â°29Â·6âE (north west of [[Cape Terawhiti]]) refers timings to [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]] while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti in the middle of Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart spring tide at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Power generation===
{{Main article|Tidal power}}
Tidal energy can be extracted by two means: inserting a water [[turbine]] into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine. In the first case, the energy amount is entirely determined by the timing and tidal current magnitude. However, the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships. In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, [[Rance tidal power plant|La Rance]] at [[St Malo|Saint Malo]], France) which face many difficulties. Aside from environmental issues, simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges.

Tidal power proponents point out that, unlike wind power systems, generation levels can be reliably predicted, save for weather effects. While some generation is possible for most of the tidal cycle, in practice turbines lose efficiency at lower operating rates. Since the power available from a flow is proportional to the cube of the flow speed, the times during which high power generation is possible are brief.

==Navigation==
[[File:Tide legal use.gif|thumb|left|US civil and maritime uses of tidal data|alt=Chart illustrating that tidal heights enter in calculations of legally significant data such as ''boundary lines'' between the high seas and territorial waters. Chart shows an exemplar coastline, identifying bottom features such as longshore bar and berms, tidal heights such as mean higher high water, and distances from shore such as the 12 mile limit.]]

Tidal flows are important for navigation, and significant errors in position occur if they are not accommodated. Tidal heights are also important; for example many rivers and harbours have a shallow "bar" at the entrance which prevents boats with significant [[Draft (hull)|draft]] from entering at low tide.

Until the advent of automated navigation, competence in calculating tidal effects was important to naval officers. The certificate of examination for lieutenants in the [[Royal Navy]] once declared that the prospective officer was able to "shift his tides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal flow timings and velocities appear in ''tide charts'' or a [[tidal stream atlas]]. Tide charts come in sets. Each chart covers a single hour between one high water and another (they ignore the leftover 24 minutes) and show the average tidal flow for that hour. An arrow on the tidal chart indicates the direction and the average flow speed (usually in [[Knot (unit)|knots]]) for spring and neap tides. If a tide chart is not available, most nautical charts have "[[tidal diamond]]s" which relate specific points on the chart to a table giving tidal flow direction and speed.

The standard procedure to counteract tidal effects on navigation is to (1) calculate a "[[dead reckoning]]" position (or DR) from travel distance and direction, (2) mark the chart (with a vertical cross like a plus sign) and (3) draw a line from the DR in the tide's direction. The distance the tide moves the boat along this line is computed by the tidal speed, and this gives an "estimated position" or EP (traditionally marked with a dot in a triangle).

[[File:Tidal Indicator Delaware River ca1897.jpg|thumb|Tidal Indicator, Delaware River, Delaware c. 1897. At the time shown in the figure, the tide is {{frac|1|1|4}} feet above mean low water and is still falling, as indicated by pointing of the arrow. Indicator is powered by system of pulleys, cables and a float. (Report Of The Superintendent Of The Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey Showing The Progress Of The Work During The Fiscal Year Ending With June 1897 (p. 483))]]

[[Nautical chart]]s display the water's "charted depth" at specific locations with "[[Echo sounding|sounding]]s" and the use of bathymetric [[contour line]]s to depict the submerged surface's shape. These depths are relative to a "[[chart datum]]", which is typically the water level at the lowest possible astronomical tide (although other datums are commonly used, especially historically, and tides may be lower or higher for meteorological reasons) and are therefore the minimum possible water depth during the tidal cycle. "Drying heights" may also be shown on the chart, which are the heights of the exposed [[seabed]] at the lowest astronomical tide.

Tide tables list each day's high and low water heights and times. To calculate the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height. Depth for other times can be derived from tidal curves published for major ports. The [[rule of twelfths]] can suffice if an accurate curve is not available. This approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour â 1/12, second â 2/12, third â 3/12, fourth â 3/12, fifth â 2/12, sixth â 1/12.

==Biological aspects==

===Intertidal ecology===
[[File:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A rock, seen at low water, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation.|alt=Photo of partially submerged rock showing horizontal bands of different color and texture, where each band represents a different fraction of time spent submerged.]]
{{Main article|Intertidal ecology}}
{{Further information|Intertidal zone}}

Intertidal ecology is the study of [[ecosystem]]s between the low- and high-water lines along a shore. At low water, the intertidal zone is exposed (or ''emersed''), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or ''immersed''). Intertidal [[ecologist]]s therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as among the [[biological interaction|different species]]. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates â [[rocky shore]] or soft bottom.

Intertidal organisms experience a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have [[adaptation|adapted]] to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature is [[vertical zonation]], in which the community divides into distinct horizontal bands of specific species at each elevation above low water. A species' ability to cope with [[desiccation]] determines its upper limit, while [[competition (biology)|competition]] with other species sets its lower limit.

Humans [[Exploitation of natural resources|use]] [[Intertidal ecology|intertidal regions]] for food and recreation. [[Overexploitation]] can damage intertidals directly. Other anthropogenic actions such as introducing [[invasive species]] and [[global warming|climate change]] have large negative effects. [[Marine Protected Area]]s are one option communities can apply to protect these areas and aid scientific [[research]].

===Biological rhythms===
The approximately fortnightly tidal cycle has large effects on intertidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bos, A.R. |author2=Gumanao, G.S. |author3=van Katwijk, M.M. |author4=Mueller, B. |author5=Saceda, M.M. |author6=Tejada, R.P. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2011 |title=Ontogenetic habitat shift, population growth, and burrowing behavior of the Indo-Pacific beach star ''Archaster typicus'' (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) |journal=Marine Biology |volume=158 |issue= 3|pages=639â648|doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1588-0|pmid=24391259 |pmc=3873073}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bos, A.R. |author2= Gumanao, G.S. |last-author-amp= yes |date=2012 |title=The lunar cycle determines availability of coral reef fishes on fish markets |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=2074â2079|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03454.x |pmid= 23130702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence their [[biological rhythm]]s tend to occur in rough multiples of this period. Many other animals such as the [[vertebrate]]s, display similar rhythms. Examples include [[gestation]] and egg hatching. In humans, the [[menstrual cycle]] lasts roughly a [[lunar month]], an even multiple of the tidal period. Such parallels at least hint at the [[common descent]] of all animals from a marine ancestor.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;{{cite book

==Other tides==
When oscillating tidal currents in the stratified ocean flow over uneven bottom topography, they generate [[internal wave]]s with tidal frequencies. Such waves are called ''[[internal tide]]s''.

Shallow areas in otherwise open water can experience rotary tidal currents, flowing in directions that continually change and thus the flow direction (not the flow) completes a full rotation in {{frac|12|1|2}} hours (for example, the [[Nantucket Shoals]]).&lt;ref name=rocur&gt;Le Lacheur, Embert A.

Accessed: 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience ''[[atmospheric tide]]s'' and ''[[Earth tide]]s''. These are [[continuum mechanics|continuum mechanical]] phenomena. The first two take place in [[fluid mechanics|fluid]]s. The third affects the Earth's thin [[Solid mechanics|solid]] crust surrounding its semi-liquid interior (with various modifications).

This is so small that other larger effects completely mask any tide, and as such these lakes are considered non-tidal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do the Great Lakes have tides?|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/gltides.html|website=National Ocean Service|publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric tides===
Atmospheric tides are negligible at ground level and aviation altitudes, masked by [[weather]]'s much more important effects.&lt;!-- and solar thermal tides. However, there is no strict upper limit to the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and the tidal pull increases with the distance from the Earth's center.--&gt; Atmospheric tides are both gravitational and thermal in origin and are the dominant dynamics from about {{convert|80| to |120|km|mi}}, above which the molecular density becomes too low to support fluid behavior.

===Earth tides===
{{Main article|Earth tide}}

Earth tides or terrestrial tides affect the entire Earth's mass, which acts similarly to a liquid [[gyroscope]] with a very thin crust. The Earth's crust shifts (in/out, east/west, north/south) in response to lunar and solar gravitation, ocean tides, and atmospheric loading. While negligible for most human activities, terrestrial tides' semi-diurnal amplitude can reach about {{convert|55|cm|in}} at the Equatorâ{{convert|15|cm|in}} due to the Sunâwhich is important in [[GPS]] calibration and [[VLBI]] measurements. Precise astronomical angular measurements require knowledge of the Earth's rotation rate and [[polar motion]], both of which are influenced by Earth tides. The semi-diurnal ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Earth tides are nearly in phase with the Moon with a lag of about two hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Galactic tides===
''[[Galactic tide]]s'' are the tidal forces exerted by galaxies on stars within them and [[Satellite galaxy|satellite galaxies]] orbiting them. The galactic tide's effects on the [[Solar System]]'s [[Oort cloud]] are believed to cause 90 percent of long-period comets.&lt;ref&gt;

==Misnomers==
[[Tsunami]]s, the large waves that occur after earthquakes, are sometimes called ''tidal waves'', but this name is given by their ''resemblance'' to the tide, rather than any actual link to the tide. Other phenomena unrelated to tides but using the word ''tide'' are [[rip current|rip tide]], [[storm tide]], [[hurricane tide]], and [[oil spill|black]] or [[red tide]]s.  Many of these usages are historic and refer to the earlier meaning of tide as "a portion of time, a season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|tide|volume=XVIII|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
