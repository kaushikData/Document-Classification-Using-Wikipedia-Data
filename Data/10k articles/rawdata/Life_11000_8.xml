'''Alexander Emmanuel Rodolphe Agassiz''' (December 17, 1835{{snd}}March 27, 1910), son of [[Louis Agassiz]] and stepson of [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz]], was an American scientist and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=The Guide to Nature |year=1910 |publisher= |page= |quote=Alexander Emmanuel Rudolph Agassiz, better known to the world as Alexander Agassiz, simply, was for nearly half a century, in portions of the 19th and 20th, one of the most remarkable scientists of his time, but, unlike nearly all others who have devoted their lives to original research, he was a man of wealth which counted among the millions. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c4eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Rudolph+Agassiz%22+polo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rudolph%20Agassiz%22%20polo&amp;f=false |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Agassiz was born in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]] and immigrated to the United States with his father, [[Louis Agassiz|Louis]], in 1849. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1855, subsequently studying [[engineering]] and [[chemistry]], and taking the degree of [[bachelor of science]] at the [[Lawrence scientific school]] of the same institution in 1857; in 1859 became an assistant in the [[United States Coast Survey]].&lt;ref name="LeonardMarquis1908"/&gt; 
Thenceforward he became a specialist in marine [[ichthyology]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agassiz, Alexander Emanuel|volume=1|pages=366-367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassiz was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1862.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the summer of 1866, Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard.

[[E. J. Hulbert]], a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, [[Quincy Adams Shaw]], had discovered a rich copper lode known as the [[Calumet conglomerate]] on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] in [[Michigan]]. Hulbert persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] based in [[Calumet, Michigan]]. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise.

Over the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter, due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines. He returned to the mines in March 1867, with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations.

Agassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation. The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] with Shaw as its first president. In August 1871, Shaw "retired" to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death. Until the turn of the century, this company was by far the largest copper producer in the United States, many years producing over half of the total.

Agassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time, year-round, attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard. Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative [[zoology]] and other purposes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Shortly after the death of his father in 1873, Agassiz acquired a small peninsula in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], which features spectacular views of Narragansett Bay. Here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence. The house was completed in 1875 and today is known as the [[Inn at Castle Hill]].

In 1875, he surveyed [[Lake Titicaca]], Peru, examined the copper mines of Peru and [[Chile]], and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] (MCZ), of which he was first curator from 1874 to 1885 and then director until his death in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;About MCZ (History) - http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/about/history.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518055636/http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/about/history.html |date=2018-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He assisted [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' Expedition]], and wrote the ''Review of the Echini'' (2 vols., 1872–1874) in the reports. Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three [[Marine biology dredge|dredging]] expeditions of the steamer ''Blake'' of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1896 Agassiz visited [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] and inspected the [[Great Barrier Reef]], publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.

Of Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology. However, in 1865, he published with [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], his stepmother, ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'', a work at once exact and stimulating. They also published, in 1871, ''Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He received the German Order [[Pour le Mérite]] for Science and Arts in August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=19 August 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36850| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassiz served as a president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], which since 1913 has awarded the [[Alexander Agassiz Medal]] in his memory. He died in 1910 on board the [[RMS Adriatic (1907)|RMS ''Adriatic'']] en route to New York from [[Southampton]].

He was the father of three sons – George R. Agassiz (1861–1951), Maximilian Agassiz (1866–1943) and [[Rodolphe Agassiz]] (1871–1933).

'''Amicus Therapeutics''' is a public American [[biopharmaceutical]] company based in [[Cranbury, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  The company [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 2007 under the [[NASDAQ]] trading symbol FOLD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Amicus Therapeutics IPO raises $75 mln, in range | date=30 May 2007 | agency=Reuters | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/31/amicustherapeutics-ipo-idUSWEN848220070531 | deadurl=no&lt;!--added to archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed a 2006 planned offering and subsequent withdrawal, which would have established the trading symbol as AMTX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Amicus Therapeutics files $86M IPO | author=Gelsi, Steve | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=17 May 2006 | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amicus-therapeutics-files-86m-ipo | deadurl=no&lt;!--added to archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Moyer, Liz | title=IPOs Head For The Exits | date=16 Aug 2006 | work=[[Forbes]] | url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/15/ipo-offerings-pulled-cx_lm_0816ipo.html | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; | quote=There have been five withdrawn IPOs so far this month, including ... Amicus Therapeutics.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to their IPO, Amicus was funded by a variety of [[Venture capital financing|venture capital]] firms including [[Radius Ventures]], Canaan Partners and [[New Enterprise Associates]].&lt;ref name="rubin2006"&gt;{{cite news | author=Rubin, Evelyn | title=Amicus IPO: A Very Risky Prospect (AMTX) | work=[[Seeking Alpha]] | date=18 May 2006 | url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/10870-amicus-ipo-a-very-risky-prospect-amtx | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The therapeutic focus of Amicus is on [[Rare disease|rare and orphan diseases]], particularly disorders collectively called [[Lysosomal storage disease|lysosomal storage disorders]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  The company has focused on [[pharmacological chaperone]]s and [[enzyme replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|2,18}}&lt;ref name="williams2014"&gt;{{cite book | author=Williams, Cory | editor=Pryde, David C. | editor2=Palmer, Michael J. | title=Orphan Drugs and Rare Diseases | chapter=Chapter 4. Treating Rare Diseases: Business Model for Orphan Drug Development | publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | year=2014 | ISBN=9781849738064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}}

In 2008, the company expanded from its single site in New Jersey to a second research site in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="biotechweek2008"&gt;{{cite news | title=Amicus Therapeutics Opens Research Facility in San Diego. | author=Staff | date=1 Oct 2008 | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185777890.html | work=[[Biotech Week]] | location=United States | via=[[HighBeam Research]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the company faced a major financial setback with the termination of a multi-year collaboration agreement with [[Shire (pharmaceutical company)|Shire]] for its lead compound, [[migalastat]], and two other products.&lt;ref name="10Q2009Q3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1178879/000095012309057623/c91935e10vq.htm | title=Form 10-Q: Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. | date=30 Sep 2009 | publisher=[[USSEC]] | website=[[EDGAR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}  Amicus cut 20% of its workforce.&lt;ref name="10Q2009Q3" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

The next year, the company signed an exclusive license agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline]] for miglastat; GSK paid $60 million in upfront and equity payments while promising up to $170 million to help developother products,&lt;ref name="carroll2013"&gt;{{cite news | author=Carroll, John | title=GlaxoSmithKline politely dumps $230M Fabry drug deal with Amicus | date=20 Nov 2013 | work=FierceBiotech | url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-politely-dumps-230m-fabry-drug-deal-amicus/2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GSK terminated the arrangement in 2013.&lt;ref name="carroll2013" /&gt;

In November 2013, Amicus acquired competitor Callidus Biopharma for its enzyme replacement therapy treatment for [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|3,12}}

In September 2015, the company acquired [[Scioderm]] for $229 million in cash and stock, with potentially $618 million more in [[biodollar]]s. Scioderm had a drug in Phase III trials for [[epidermolysis bullosa]]; additionally, if the drug was approved the FDA would give its owner a [[priority review voucher]], which itself can be sold to another company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fidler|first1=Ben|title=Xconomy: With $229M Deal, Amicus Gets a New Drug And Perhaps a Voucher|url=https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2015/08/31/with-229m-deal-amicus-gets-a-new-drug-and-maybe-a-voucher/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That drug failed its Phase III trial in 2017 and Amicus abandoned it. It had paid out around half of the milestones to Scioderm's shareholders prior to closing down the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Phil|title=Amicus ditches skin disorder drug after late-stage failure|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/amicus-ditches-skin-disorder-drug-after-late-stage-failure|work=FierceBiotech|date=September 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in September 2015, Amicus announced that it would submit a [[new drug application]] (NDA) for [[Accelerated approval (FDA)|accelerated approval]] of [[migalastat]] to the FDA by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="NDA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.drugs.com/nda/migalastat_150915.html|publisher=[[Drugs.com]]|title=Amicus Therapeutics Plans to Submit NDA for Migalastat for Fabry Disease Following Positive Pre-NDA Meeting With FDA|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An FDA committee recommended approval in April 2016, but the FDA rejected the application in November for having insufficient data in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=FDA rejects quick Amicus Fabry drug read-through, new data not expected till 2019|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fda-rejects-quick-amicus-fabry-drug-read-through-new-data-not-expected-til-2019|work=FierceBiotech|date=November 29, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drug was approved in the European Union in May 2016.&lt;ref name="Newswire"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/05/31/844646/0/en/Amicus-Therapeutics-Announces-European-Commission-Approval-for-Galafold-Migalastat-in-Patients-with-Fabry-Disease-in-European-Union.html|title=Amicus Therapeutics Announces European Commission Approval for Galafold (Migalastat) in Patients with Fabry Disease in European Union|publisher=GlobeNewswire|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2016 Amicus acquired MiaMed which was working on drugs to treat [[CDKL5]] deficiency; Amicus paid $1.8M in cash and around $4.7M in stock, with $83M in biodollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=Amicus spends $90M on MiaMed; gains rare disease preclinical program|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/amicus-spends-90m-miamed-gains-rare-disease-preclinical-program|work=FierceBiotech|date=July 7, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Scott Gottlieb]] became FDA commissioner in 2017, the CEO of Amicus began lobbying him directly for the FDA to accept the NDA and in February 2018 the FDA accepted it and promised a response by August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|title=Once rejected, FDA now rolls out a short red carpet for Amicus’ migalastat|url=https://endpts.com/once-rejected-fda-now-rolls-out-a-short-red-carpet-for-amicus-migalastat/|work=Endpoints|date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Amicus announced that it had acquired Celenex, which had ten early stage gene therapies. Amicus paid $100 million upfront and could pay an additional $352 million if developmental milestones are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/09/20/a-100-million-biotech-deal-is-also-a-tale-of-two-executives-facing-their-kids-deadly-diseases/#6ee26df82aad|title=A $100 Million Biotech Deal Is Also A Tale Of Two Executives Facing Their Kids' Deadly Diseases|last=Herper|first=Matthew|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12539">'''Augmented learning''' is an on-demand [[learning]] technique where the environment adapts to the learner. By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/an-interview-with-mcgraw-hill-higher-education-president-brian-kibby-about-the-future-of-ebooks-tctv/ Augmented learning and super-adaptive learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies incorporating [[rich media]] and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing.  Instead of focusing on [[memorization]], the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.

Most implementations of augmented learning are forms of e-learning. In desktop computing environments, the learner receives supplemental, contextual information through an on-screen, pop-up window, [[toolbar]] or [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar]]. As the user navigates a website, e-mail or document, the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse, touch or other input device. In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones.

Augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence ([[intelligence amplification]]) and [[augmented reality]]. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through [[distributed cognition]]. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success. Mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the [[abacus]], calculator, personal computers and smart phones. Software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user. When an individual's name appears on the screen, a pop-up window could display person's organizational affiliation, contact information and most recent interactions.

In mobile reality systems,&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; the annotation may appear on the learner's individual "heads-up display" or through headphones for audio instruction. For example, apps for Google Glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click-throughs, .&lt;ref name="Augmented Reality"&gt;[http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ Augmented Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407044513/http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper-and-pen-based exercises. For example, augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter, allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters. See [[#Understanding language|Understanding language]], below.

==Just-in-time understanding and learning==
Augmentation tools can help learners understand issues, acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or "on demand." This contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning, including [[rote learning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[observational learning]], where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned.

Snyder and Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf Computer Augmented Learning: The Basis of Sustained Knowledge Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221021/http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that just-in-time learning is not sufficient. Long-term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths.

==Understanding language==
Augmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language. The interactive, dynamic nature of these on-demand language assistants can provide definitions, sample sentences and even audible pronunciations. When sentences or blocks of text are selected, the words are read aloud  while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics. Speech rate control can tailor the text-to-speech (TTS) to keep pace with the learner's comprehension.

== Understanding Science ==
Augmented reality has come a long way in the science field, but it is still in its infancy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2012-08-03|title=Affordances of Augmented Reality in Science Learning: Suggestions for Future Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=449–462|doi=10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|issn=1059-0145}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have started using webcams, making them read a certain marker label, then an object where the label would be comes up on the screen. Developers are continuing to gather information on how AR ([[augmented reality]]) could take it's part in the learning environment. Over the past few years there have been technologies added to the classroom such as computers, laptops, projectors, white boards and much more. It is allowing students to be more engaged in what is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Students are also now able to take notes without having to listening to what the teacher is saying, but instead writing what they typed on the projector.&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer" /&gt; The notes can be more thorough and to the point, rather than an entire explanation. With the help of AR we can also see pictures on the board showing students the space in between certain objects such as planets or atoms.

==Making learning fun==
One researcher&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer"&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 Klopfer, Eric] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223005434/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 |date=December 23, 2008 }}, Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines (Game Boy, PlayStation Portable) can make an impact on learning. These mobile devices excel in their portability, context sensitivity, connectivity and ubiquity. By incorporating social dynamics in a real-world context, learning games can create compelling environments for learners.

At the [[Allard Pierson Museum]] in Amsterdam, visitors view information on-demand at the "A Future for the Past" exhibit. In a virtual reconstruction of [[Satricum]] and the Forum Romanum, users can call up information that is overlaid on room-sized photos and other images. The museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest.&lt;ref name="Augmented reality"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/augmented-reality-on-hand-at-museum-in-the-netherlands-threaten/ Flatley, Joseph L.], Augmented reality at the Allard Pierson Museum in Netherland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is augmentation really "learning"?==
Critics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization; similar arguments have been made about using [[calculators]] in the past. Just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding, augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall, present and process information.

Current research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective.&lt;ref name="cell-neuron"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans |last1=Seitz |first1=Aaron R. |last2=Kim |first2=Dongho |last3=Watanabe |first3=Takeo |journal=Neuron |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=700–707 |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(09)00083-X |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual stimuli, rendered in flashes of information, showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies.

== Augmented Learning in Education ==
Augmented learning has allowed not only students to learn, but also their parents. Tools like mobile games have made it easier for parents to understand more fully what their child is learning in school. Technology brings the childs content to a new platform which is helpful to parents when trying to make meaningful connections to what their child is learning in school. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I0kaFNaK704C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=augmented+learning+in+science&amp;ots=_fcI-rZGZ7&amp;sig=Va6-WbBonsgG0kEb8wcmAotXmu0#v=onepage&amp;q=augmented%20learning%20in%20science&amp;f=false|title=Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games|last=Klopfer|first=Eric|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262113151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, augmented reality has brought a new way of learning to young children to have the ability to articulate words. By using marker labels in books that are read by a tablet, making pictures appear on the screen along with audio narration for enhanced reading. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2014-11-11|title=The interaction of child-parent shared reading with an augmented reality (AR) picture book and parents' conceptions of AR learning|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjet.12228|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=203–222|doi=10.1111/bjet.12228|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]] in education has the potential to change the timing and location of the conventional learning process. This style of learning introduces new methods of studying. With the boom of [[technology]] and younger students being the biggest users, the learning platform has the ability to connect this generation and their smartphones to gain knowledge. Though it has yet to be fully discovered, Augmented Reality in education is looking to become a large market.

This style of learning can gain attention and expand the students interest in subject and topics he would not learn or come across in the conventional classroom lecture. Extra data such as fun facts, visual models, or historical data from events could give a wider understanding of the topics being taught. The learning platform hopes to explain abstract concepts, engage and interact with the learner, and discover and learn additional information about what they what to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12591">'''Automated reasoning''' is an area of [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]] dedicated to understanding different aspects of [[reasoning]]. The study of automated reasoning helps produce [[computer programs]] that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of [[artificial intelligence]], it also has connections with [[theoretical computer science]], and even [[philosophy]].

The most developed subareas of automated reasoning are [[automated theorem proving]] (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of [[interactive theorem proving]]) and [[automated proof checking]] (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by [[analogy]] [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]].

Other important topics include reasoning under [[uncertainty]] and [[Non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Pollock]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.

Tools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics&lt;!-- [[Classical logic]]? --&gt; and calculi, [[fuzzy logic]], [[Bayesian inference]], reasoning with [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximal entropy]] and a large number of less formal ''ad hoc'' techniques.

==Early years==
The development of [[formal logic]] played a big role in the field of automated reasoning, which itself led to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. A [[formal proof]] is a proof in which every logical inference has been checked back to the fundamental [[axioms]] of mathematics. All the intermediate logical steps are supplied, without exception. No appeal is made to intuition, even if the translation from intuition to logic is routine. Thus, a formal proof is less intuitive, and less susceptible to logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;C. Hales, Thomas [http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101370p.pdf "Formal Proof"], University of Pittsburgh. Retrieved on 2010-10-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the Cornell Summer meeting of 1957, which brought together a large number of logicians and computer scientists, as the origin of automated reasoning, or [[automated deduction]].&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/projects/nuprl/Intro/AutoDeduction/autoded.html "Automated Deduction (AD)"], ''[The Nature of PRL Project]''. Retrieved on 2010-10-19&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that it began before that with the 1955 [[Logic Theorist]] program of Newell, Shaw and Simon, or with Martin Davis’ 1954 implementation of [[Presburger arithmetic|Presburger’s decision procedure]] (which proved that the sum of two even numbers is even).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Davis, "The Prehistory and Early History of Automated Deduction," in Automation of Reasoning, eds. Siekmann and Wrightson, vol. 1, 1-28 at p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Automated reasoning, although a significant and popular area of research, went through an "[[AI winter]]" in the eighties and early nineties. The field subsequently revived, however. For example, in 2005, [[Microsoft]] started using [[Software verification|verification technology]] in many of their internal projects and is planning to include a logical specification and checking language in their 2012 version of Visual C.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;

==Significant contributions==
'''[[Principia Mathematica]]''' was a milestone work in [[formal logic]] written by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Principia Mathematica - also meaning [[Principles of Mathematics]] - was written with a purpose to derive all or some of the [[mathematical expression]]s, in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. Principia Mathematica was initially published in three volumes in 1910, 1912 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/ "Principia Mathematica"], at [[Stanford University]]. Retrieved 2010-10-19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Logic Theorist]]''' (LT) was the first ever program developed in 1956 by [[Allen Newell]], [[Cliff Shaw]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] to "mimic human reasoning" in proving theorems and was demonstrated on fifty-two theorems from chapter two of Principia Mathematica, proving thirty-eight of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~eroberts/cs91/projects/ethics-of-ai/sec1_2.html "The Logic Theorist and its Children"]. Retrieved 2010-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to proving the theorems, the program found a proof for one of the theorems that was more elegant than the one provided by Whitehead and Russell. After an unsuccessful attempt at publishing their results, Newell, Shaw, and Herbert reported in their publication in 1958, ''The Next Advance in Operation Research'':

::''"There are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create. Moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until (in a visible future) the range of problems they can handle will be co- extensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied."&lt;ref&gt;Shankar, Natarajan ''[http://www.csl.sri.com/~shankar/ Little Engines of Proof]'', Computer Science Laboratory, [[SRI International]]. Retrieved 2010-10-19&lt;/ref&gt; ''

==Proof systems==
;Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover (NQTHM)
:The design of [[Nqthm|NQTHM]] was influenced by John McCarthy and Woody Bledsoe. Started in 1971 at Edinburgh, Scotland, this was a fully automatic theorem prover built using Pure [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. The main aspects of NQTHM were:
:# the use of Lisp as a working logic.
:# the reliance on a principle of definition for total recursive functions.
:# the extensive use of rewriting and "symbolic evaluation".
:# an induction heuristic based the failure of symbolic evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/best-ideas/nqthm/index.html The Boyer- Moore Theorem Prover]''. Retrieved on 2010-10-23&lt;/ref&gt;

;HOL Light
:Written in [[OCaml]], [[HOL Light]] is designed to have a simple and clean logical foundation and an uncluttered implementation. It is essentially another proof assistant for classical higher order logic.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John ''[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/slides/tphols-18aug09/slides.pdf HOL Light: an overview]''. Retrieved 2010-10-23&lt;/ref&gt;

;Coq
:Developed in France, [[Coq]] is another automated proof assistant, which can automatically extract executable programs from specifications, as either Objective CAML or [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] source code. Properties, programs and proofs are formalized in the same language called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://coq.inria.fr/a-short-introduction-to-coq Introduction to Coq]''. Retrieved 2010-10-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Automated reasoning has been most commonly used to build automated theorem provers. Oftentimes, however, theorem provers require some human guidance to be effective and so more generally qualify as [[proof assistant]]s. In some cases such provers have come up with new approaches to proving a theorem. [[Logic Theorist]] is a good example of this. The program came up with a proof for one of the theorems in [[Principia Mathematica]] that was more efficient (requiring fewer steps) than the proof provided by Whitehead and Russell. Automated reasoning programs are being applied to solve a growing number of problems in formal logic, mathematics and computer science, [[logic programming]], software and hardware verification, [[circuit design]], and many others. The [[Automated theorem proving|TPTP]] (Sutcliffe and Suttner 1998) is a library of such problems that is updated on a regular basis. There is also a competition among automated theorem provers held regularly at the [[Conference on Automated Deduction|CADE]] conference (Pelletier, Sutcliffe and Suttner 2002); the problems for the competition are selected from the TPTP library.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-automated/ Automated Reasoning]'', [[Stanford Encyclopedia]].

'''Celgene Corporation''' is an American biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes medicines for cancer and inflammatory disorders.  It is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in [[Summit, New Jersey]]. The company's major product is Revlimid ([[lenalidomide]]), in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]] patients. Revlimid is also approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk [[Myelodysplastic syndrome| Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)]] associated with a [[Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome|deletion 5q]] [[cytogenetic abnormality]] with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Revlimid is sold through proprietary risk-management distribution programs to ensure safe and appropriate use of these pharmaceuticals. Vidaza is approved for the treatment of patients with MDS.

Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a subsidiary, is a public [[cord blood bank]].

== History ==
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the [[Celanese|Celanese Corporation]], was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.

In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes.  Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.

In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies.  Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.

In 2006 Celgene certified McKesson Specialty, a [[specialty pharmacy]], as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch [[lenalidomide]] (trade name Revlimid). As a [[specialty drugs|specialty drug]], lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.&lt;ref name="prnewswire_2006"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celgene-selects-mckesson-specialty-as-a-revassist-program-pharmacy-vendor-to-launch-revlimid-55294122.html |title=Celgene Selects McKesson Specialty as a RevAssist Program Pharmacy Vendor to Launch REVLIMID: McKesson Specialty to Provide Dispensing, Reimbursement and Clinical Services |date=13 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2015 |work=PRNewswire |location=Harahan, La.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.

In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1362847 Celgene to Acquire Gloucester Pharmaceuticals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713233841/http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1362847 |date=2012-07-13 }}, Dec. 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ukconstructionmagazine.co.uk/online/uk_construction/uk_features/august2011/New%20Head%20Quarters%20for%20Celgene.html | work=UK Construction magazine | title={{sic|hide=y|New Head Q|uarters|expected=Headquarters}} for Celgene - Stockley Park greets new tenant | date=13 October 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030172347/http://www.ukconstructionmagazine.co.uk/online/uk_construction/uk_features/august2011/New%20Head%20Quarters%20for%20Celgene.html | archivedate=30 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1442901 Celgene to Acquire Abraxis BioScience Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716010035/http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1442901 |date=2012-07-16 }}, Jun. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.avilatx.com/news/2012_0126_AvilaCelgene.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/12/31/grading-pharma-in-2013-16-drug-companies-ranked/ |title= Grading Pharma in 2013|publisher=Forbes |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer [[Stem cell therapy|stem cell therapeutic]] development agreement encompassing [[demcizumab]] and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=OncoMed, Celgene in $3.3B+ Cancer Stem Cell Collaboration | author=Staff | date=January 1, 2014 | page=8 | work=[[Gen. Eng. Biotechnol. News]] | department=Industry Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, [[Sutro Biopharma]] entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sutro Biopharma and Celgene Corporation Enter Multi-Year Strategic Collaboration and Option to Acquire Agreement| url=http://www.sutrobio.com/sutro-biopharma-and-celgene-corporation-enter-multi-year-strategic-collaboration-and-option-to-acquire-agreement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with [[Astrazeneca]], worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astrazeneca-inks-1-8b-in-immuno-oncology-deals-as-q1-profit-dips/81251193/|title=GEN - News Highlights:AstraZeneca Inks $1.8B in Immuno-Oncology Deals as Q1 Profit Dips|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire [[Quanticel]] for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels [[epigenetic]] modifier targeting applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/celgene-to-acquire-quanticel-for-up-to-485m/81251196/|title=GEN - News Highlights:Celgene to Acquire Quanticel for Up-to-$485M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed [[Lycera]]s RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound [[LYC-30937]] for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/celgene-licenses-lycera-s-immune-modulators-in-up-to-105m-deal/81251366/|title=Celgene Licenses Lycera's Immune Modulators in Up-to-$105M+ Deal|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire [[Receptos]] for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/celgene-to-acquire-receptos-for-7-2b/81251504/|title=Celgene to Acquire Receptos for $7.2B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.

&lt;!-- no ind'n here a/o 2016 November of logic of organizing drugs in order Vid, Rev, Thal, Alker, Foc, and indic'ns  chronologically within drug.

As article is on company, not drugs per se, IMO most logical for users is by drug's date of first approval, and chrono w/in drug. Would be nice to provide users w/ switch to reverse order, and switch to choose among (1) that and  (2) drugs in chrono or reverse chrono  order, and chrono within drug. But that would take more wiki-skill

=== Product-related history ===
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalomid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.

In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.

In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q [[cytogenetic abnormality]] with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.Focalin XR was later launched by Celgene and Novartis in 2005.

In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalomid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.

== Litigation ==

===Anti-trust allegations===
In 2009, [[Dr. Reddy]]’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® ([[thalidomide]]).  Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.

Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.

Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® ([[thalidomide]]) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud allegations===
In July 2017, Celgene agreed to pay $280 million to government agencies to settle allegations that it caused the submission of false claims or fraudulent claims for non-reimbursable uses of its drugs Revlimid and Thalomid to Medicare and state Medicaid programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Celgene Agrees to Pay $280 Million to Resolve Fraud Allegations Related to Promotion of Cancer Drugs For Uses Not Approved by FDA |publisher=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney’s Office, Central District of California |date=July 24, 2017 |author=Thom Mrozek |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/celgene-agrees-pay-280-million-resolve-fraud-allegations-related-promotion-cancer-drugs |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its July 2017 10-Q, Celgene disclosed that it resolved the matter in full for $315 million, including fees and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/816284/000081628417000009/a2017063010q.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought under the [[False Claims Act]] by Beverly Brown, a former Celgene sales representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Celgene to Pay $280 Million to Settle Fraud Suit Over Cancer Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/health/celgene-to-pay-280-million-to-settle-fraud-suit-over-cancer-drugs.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clover''' is the production name given to the [[Kaiju|giant monster]] in the [[2008 in film|2008]] film ''[[Cloverfield]]''. The creature was originally conceived by producer [[J. J. Abrams]] and was designed by artist [[Neville Page]]. In the film, the monster's name is never mentioned; the name "Cloverfield" is only given to the [[US Department of Defense]] case file of the incidents depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense names the creature "LSA" for '''Large-Scale Aggressor''' in the film's [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] special feature called "Cloverfield Special Investigation Mode". The name Clover was the nickname affectionately given to the monster among the production staff.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news | author=Larry Carroll |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576563/20071214/story.jhtml | title='Cloverfield' Star Speaks At Last, Shedding Light On Secret J.J. Abrams Flick | publisher=MTV.com | date=2007-12-17 | accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
The monster was first referred to in the [[viral marketing]] campaign for ''Cloverfield'', including a recording of its roar, foreign news clips about a monster attack and sonar images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michelle Kung | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2008/01/12/the_marketing_of_cloverfield_has_been_as_mysterious_as_the_movie_itself/ | title=The marketing of 'Cloverfield' has been as mysterious as the movie itself | publisher=Boston Globe | date=2008-01-13 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It then made its first full appearance in the film, where it was seen to be 25 stories tall&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; and rampaging through [[New York City]] while being attacked by the [[United States military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Matt Reeves (Director)|title=Cloverfield|medium=Film|location=United States|publisher=Paramount Pictures|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar monster next appears in the four-part [[manga]] series ''[[Cloverfield/Kishin]]'' (2008) by Yoshiki Togawa, which serves as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Yoshiki Togawa | script-title=ja:クローバーフィールド／ＫＩＳＨＩＮ |trans-title=Cloverfield / KISHIN| publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] | year=2008 | type=Manga|language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=12752 | title="CLOVERFIELD" MANGA OFFERS MORE CLUES, QUESTIONS | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=2008-01-15 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clover does not appear in the second film of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], the 2016 film ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]''.

Despite its size, Clover was conceived by the film's creators as being a newborn.&lt;ref name="baby"/&gt; In ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'' (2018), a similar but significantly larger creature is seen at the conclusion of the film. Earlier in the 2018 film, a massive shadow was seen by the character Michael Hamilton, but it is not made clear if the shadow was from the creature seen at the end of the film, or from the original Clover, or from a third member of Clover’s species.

==Concept and creation==
J. J. Abrams conceived of a new monster after he and his son visited a toy store in Japan while promoting ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''. He explained, "We saw all these [[Godzilla]] toys, and I thought, we need our own [American] monster, and not like [[King Kong]], King Kong's adorable. But I wanted something that was just insane and intense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/31340/Cloverfield-Making-of-a-monster|title=Cloverfield: Making of a monster|last=Monetti|first=Sandro|work=Express|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monster was designed by artist Neville Page. He sought a biological rationale for the creature, though many of his ideas would not show up on screen. Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from "[[Separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]]". He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant, saying "there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked".&lt;ref name="merry"&gt;{{cite news | author = Max Evry | title = Reeves Runs Merrily Through Cloverfield | publisher = ComingSoon.net | date = 2008-01-21 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=41100 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page said of the creature's backstory, "For me, one of the most key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with. It is not out there just killing. It is confused, lost, scared. It's a newborn. Having this be a story point (one that the audience does not know), it allowed for some purposeful choices about its anatomy, movement and, yes, motivations".&lt;ref name=vfx/&gt; The creature was developed by visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank and [[Phil Tippett]]'s company Tippett Studio. Blank described the intended goal of the creature, "Rather than the monster having a personality [like [[Godzilla]] or [[King Kong]]], it's more of an entity or an event".&lt;ref name="vfx"&gt;{{cite news | author=Tara DiLullo Bennett | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3524&amp;page=1 | title=''Cloverfield'': Reinventing the Monster Movie | publisher=VFXWorld | date=2008-01-22 | accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves described the creature's reaction to its surroundings thus: "It’s this new environment that it finds frightening". To indicate this, Reeves suggested the addition of white in the creature's eyes so it would look similar to a spooked horse.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/spotlights/cloverfieldnotes.doc |title=Production notes |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045123/http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/spotlights/cloverfieldnotes.doc |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers generated and used the idea of parasites because the film could not realistically have scenes between the human protagonists and the enormous creature.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

===Creature design===
Although conceived by the film's creators as infantile,&lt;ref name="baby"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/8783/press_conference_report_matt_reeves_director_of_cloverfield.html | title = Press conference report: Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield | work = Kieran R. Hickey | publisher = Den of Geek |date = 2008-01-29 | accessdate = 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creature is 25 stories tall ([[Storey#Overview|corresponding to]] 250+ feet or 76+ meters)&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; and withstands missiles, artillery shells, and bombs with minimal injury.

It is vaguely quadrupedal, though capable of standing upright over short distances. The limbs are comparatively long and thin compared with the body core, and according to creator Neville Page, this, coupled with its quadrupedal stance, is meant to imply that it is a newborn: he speculates that the adults may be bipedal. The forelimbs are large in proportion to the body, and the hind legs stubby. The creature's head at first glance appears to be a solid sphere; but it can open its mouth extremely wide. Above the eyes on either side of the head are fleshy pouches which it inflates when agitated.

The creature's design includes appendages on its underbelly, described by Neville Page as an "elongated, and articulated external [[esophagus]] with the business end terminating in teethlike fingers". They were designed to relate the scale of human prey to the huge scale of the creature. The scenes from the film where people were consumed by these appendages were cut from the final edit, but the fourth and final chapter of ''Cloverfield/Kishin'' shows this.&lt;ref name="tagruato"&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://tagruato.blogspot.com/2008/03/tagruato-interview-cloverfield-lead.html
|title= Tagruato Interview: Cloverfield Lead Creature Designer Neville Page
|accessdate= 2016-06-26
|date= 2008-03-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature is covered with [[parasitism|parasites]], which it sheds as part of a "post-birth ritual".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Abrams described the parasites as "horrifying, dog-sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening". Reeves added that "The parasites have a voracious, rabid, bounding nature, but they also have a crab-like crawl. They have the viciousness of a dog, but with the ability to climb walls and stick to objects."&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The top half of the parasite's head is the mandible. The top and lower jaws end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each. The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean-like carapace, several pairs of claws, and arms. A deep blue-purple muscular membrane stretches between the top and lower jaws. When a human is bitten, the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely, mainly from the eyes, and shortly after this, the torso expands and explodes. They are called HSPs (Human Scale Parasites) on the Blu-ray Special Investigation Mode.

Artist Neville Page, in response to claims that the design of the creature was similar to that of the 2006 South Korean film ''[[The Host (2006 film)|The Host]]'', said, "They are [similar] in that they ravage and seem to originate from the water, but the end results are quite different. However, when I finally saw some of the concept art, there were some very obvious similarities. But then again, I think that we were both channeling similar biological possibilities."&lt;ref name=vfx/&gt;

==Origins==

Initially, the viral marketing campaign for ''Cloverfield'' suggested that the creature was an amphibious organism awakened by the fall of a satellite into the ocean. However, the events of ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'' suggest that for some versions of Earth, the organism may have originated from another dimension.

Based on the success of ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which earned over $40 million during its opening weekend in January 2008, the toy company [[Hasbro]] began accepting orders for a 14-inch limited edition toy figure of the monster to be shipped to fans starting December 24, 2008. It comes with several accessories, including the disembodied head of the Statue of Liberty, two changeable heads (one with an open mouth, one with a closed mouth), and 10 static figures of the monster's parasites.&lt;ref name="hasbro"&gt;{{cite news | author=Marc Graser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979422.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Hasbro toys with The Cloverfield Monster | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2008-01-21 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35641 CLOVERFIELD Monster Fully Revealed!!

==Critical analysis==
Reviewing the film ''Cloverfield'', the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' described the creature as "a monster for the [[MySpace]] generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Lewis Wallace | url=http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/01/cloverfield-tak.html | title=''Cloverfield'' Takes a Bite out of Box Office | publisher=[[Wired News]] | date=2008-01-19 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] noted, "The movie follows the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' rule that monsters are usually more intimidating when they are shown infrequently and only in brief glimpses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=James Berardinelli | url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/cloverfield.html | title=Review: Cloverfield | publisher=Reelviews.net | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Biancolli of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' described the creature as retaining "an air of mystery—a monstrous ''[[je ne sais quoi]]'' that makes him all the freakier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Amy Biancolli | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/reviews/5433986.html | title=An efficiently gripping sci-fi/horror romp | publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] | date=2008-01-17 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Corliss of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' complained of the recycled elements of the creature, such as its emergence mimicking the original ''[[Godzilla (1956 film)|Godzilla]]'' film and its parasites being similar to the "toy meanies" from the 1984 film ''[[Gremlins]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' expressed acceptance of the lack of explanation for the creature's origin, explaining that it "is all right with me after the tiresome opening speeches in so many of the 30 or more ''[[Godzilla]]'' films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/REVIEWS/801170302 | title=Cloverfield | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=2008-01-17 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' thought that the "main" creature was disappointing, while he considered the "mutant spider crabs" that came from it as "way scarier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Peter Howell | url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Movies/article/295166 | title='Cloverfield': Monster smash | publisher=[[Toronto Star]] | date=2008-01-18 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Person]] of ''Locus Online'' describes it as "like a cross between a truly giant mantis and Johnny the Skeletal Torso."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://locusmag.com/2008/WaldropPerson_Cloverfield.html |title=Locus Online: Howard Waldrop &amp; Lawrence Person review Cloverfield |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found that the creature was more reassuring as it appeared more in the film, explaining, "Its very nature as a walking, stalking being suggests it can somehow be killed by conventional means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Todd McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935799.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | title=Cloverfield Review | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Vognar of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' applauded the creature's appearance as cinematic:

{{cquote|The thrill here isn't in the critter but in how it's revealed. First we see what it's capable of. Then we catch a tail here, a limb there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">A '''coroner's jury''' is a body convened to assist a [[coroner]] in an [[inquest]], that is, in determining the identity of a deceased person and the cause of death. The laws on its role and function vary by jurisdiction.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Inquests in England and Wales}}

In the United Kingdom, all inquests were once conducted with a [[jury]]. They acted somewhat like a [[grand jury]], determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty-three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a Coroner's Jury merely accused, it did not [[convict]].

Since 1927, Coroner's Juries have rarely been used in England. Under the ''Coroners Act, 1988'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca1988120/s8.html Coroners Act, 1988, s 8(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; a Jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a Coroner's Jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in [[Crown Court]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], and the [[county court]]s.&lt;ref name="kcl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/coroners/jury.html|title=King's College of London - Coroner's Law Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a Coroner's Jury only determines cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), Coroner's Juries retained those powers until the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. This change came about after [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] was charged in 1975 by a Coroner's Jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny.&lt;ref name="kcl" /&gt;

==United States==
A coroner's jury deemed [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Doc Holliday]], and their [[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]] guilty in the death of [[Frank Stilwell]] in March 1882 (See [http://members.tripod.com/~Tombstonehistory/wefs.html]).

In the aftermath of the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], a coroner's jury found factory owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck responsible for the death of Mary Herman, a factory operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&amp;d=MP19110418.2.12&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Morning Press 18 April 1911 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27308">'''Conrad Henri Roy III''' (September 12, 1995 {{ndash}} July 13, 2014) was an American [[marine salvage]] captain.  His suicide at the age of 18 with encouragement from his long-distance girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, was the subject of a noted investigation and [[involuntary manslaughter]] trial in [[Massachusetts]], popularly known as the "'''texting suicide case'''".  The case, ''Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter'', involved many text messages, emails, and phone calls between Carter and Roy at the time of Roy's death. Roy had seen numerous [[mental health professional]]s and insisted he wanted to die.  They had both been prescribed psychiatric medication. The case raised complex questions about [[criminal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/crime/michelle-carter-and-conrad-roy-text-messages-trial-begins/|title=5 Things to Know: The Teen Girl Who Allegedly Urged Her Boyfriend to Kill Himself Via Texts|date=2017-06-06|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter was convicted by a judge of involuntary manslaughter, who stated this was due specifically to a final text in which Carter told Roy to get back in his truck when he became scared.

== Roy's early life and career ==
Roy was born in 1995 in [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts]]. He was sometimes socially anxious attending school and going into the classroom. For many years he worked with his father, grandfather, and uncle in his family's [[marine salvage]] business, Tucker-Roy Marine Towing and Salvage, Inc. in the New England area. In the Spring of 2014 he earned his [[United States Coast Guard Charter Boat Captain's license|captain's license]] from the Northeast Maritime Institute by completing three months of night classes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20150228/NEWS/150229439|title=Court filing reopens wound for family of Conrad Roy III|last=mlawrence@s-t.com|first=Mike Lawrence|work=southcoasttoday.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 he graduated on the [[Honors student|Honor Roll]] (highest grades) from [[Old Rochester Regional High School]] (ORR) in Mattapoisett. He was an all-around high school athlete who played baseball, rowed crew, and ran track. He graduated with a 3.88 GPA and had been accepted to Fitchburg State University to study business, but at that point had decided not to go.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/michelle_carter_trial_conrad_r.html|title=Michelle Carter trial: Conrad Roy's mother chokes up while testifying about last day they spent together|work=masslive.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy struggled with [[social anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] for which he had seen several therapists and counselors, including a [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapist]] in the weeks prior to his death. He had been hospitalized for an [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) overdose at the age of 17; he was talking to a girl he had met in a group and she called the police.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/conrad-roy-michelle-carter-c-v-r.html|title=Does Encouraging Suicide Make You a Killer?|date=2016-03-01|work=The Cut|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roy's death ==
On Sunday, July 13, 2014, following digital exchanges with Carter while interacting with his family, Roy committed [[suicide]] by poisoning himself with [[carbon monoxide]] fumes in his truck in the now-closed [[Kmart]] parking lot in [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]].  
Carter attended a different high school, [[King Philip Regional High School]], in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]]. They had met on family vacation in Florida several years prior and had maintained on-off communication, meeting only a few times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Roy's [[Funeral|Memorial Mass]] was celebrated on Saturday, July 19, 2014, at St. Anthony's Church in [[Mattapoisett]]. The Captain Conrad H. Roy III Scholarship Fund at the Northeast Maritime Institute in [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], was established in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Conrad-Henri-Roy-101530417 Obituary for Conrad Henri Roy III]&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Carter was [[Indictment|indicted]] on February 4, 2015, and [[Arraignment|arraigned]] the following day at in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] [[Juvenile court|Juvenile Court]] on charges of [[involuntary manslaughter]] in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]. The [[grand jury]] found enough to charge her with "wantonly and recklessly" assisting the suicide. She was 17 at the time and the court indicted her as a 'youthful offender' rather than a 'juvenile', meaning she could be sentenced as if an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/27/plainville-teen-charged-with-manslaughter-friend-suicide/WM5yHKA5IpobG2WXEWHLFM/story.html|title=Plainville teen charged with manslaughter in friend’s suicide - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In June 2015 a district court judge denied a defense motion to remove the Bristol County District Attorney’s office from the prosecution because DA Thomas M.

On June 16, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz of the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts, in [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] found Carter legally guilty of involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michelle-carter-text-suicide-trial-verdict-guilty/|title=Michelle Carter text suicide trial verdict: Guilty|publisher=CBSNews.com|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/16/michelle-carter-guilty-suicide-testing-trial/To0pxezEP0hArZdX8k0DtN/story.html|title=Michelle Carter found guilty in texting suicide case|publisher=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN061617"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/michelle-carter-texting-case/index.html|title=Judge finds Michelle Carter guilty of manslaughter in texting suicide case|date=16 June 2017|publisher=Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting|agency=CNN|last2=Lance|first2=Natisha|last1=Sanchez|first1=Ray|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT061617" /&gt; He stated prior to his ruling that it was Carter's phone calls with Roy when he was in his truck gassing himself (as described by Carter's texts to friends), rather than the preceding text messages, that caused him to go through with killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/michelle_carter_found_guilty_i.html|title=Michelle Carter found guilty by judge in text message suicide case|work=masslive.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to CNN, this decision "could set legal precedent for whether it's a crime to tell someone to commit suicide."&lt;ref name="CNN_Manslaughter"/&gt;  Carter remained free on [[bail]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whdh.com/news/michelle-carter-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-in-texting-suicide-case/ Michelle Carter leaving court after manslaughter conviction: http://bit.ly/2sy32RW]&lt;/ref&gt; until her sentencing on August 3 when she was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for manslaughter, though she faced up to 20 years.

In April 2016 Roy's mother Lynn reportedly said she was not sure what she wanted to happen to Carter, referring to an interaction between two unwell people and that Carter could have saved him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2016/04/11/for-conrad-roys-mother-his-suicide-isnt-just-a-controversial-case|title=For Conrad Roy’s mother, his suicide isn’t just a controversial case|date=2016-04-11|work=Boston.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the [[CBS]] '[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]' show saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that she knew exactly what she was doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/crime/conrad-roy-parents-react-michelle-carter-manslaughter-verdict/|title=Teen’s Parents Speak Out on the Girlfriend Who Encouraged Their Son’s Suicide|date=2017-06-16|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz sentenced Carter to serve a two-and-a-half-year term, with 15 months to be served in the Bristol County House of Corrections, the rest of the balance suspended, and five years of probation to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/us/michelle-carter-texting-suicide-sentencing/index.html|title=Woman sentenced to 15 months in texting suicide case|last=CNN|first=Ray Sanchez, Natisha Lance and Eric Levenson and|website=CNN|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2017/08/03/live-watch-michelle-carters-sentencing-in-texting-suicide-case|title=Michelle Carter sentenced in texting suicide case|date=2017-08-03|work=Boston.com|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the sentencing was handed down, Carter's lawyers asked Judge Moniz to issue a stay of the sentence until all of Carter's Massachusetts court appeals options are exhausted.

Michelle Carter and then 16-year-old Conrad Roy met one another in Florida in 2012 while each had been visiting relatives. After this initial encounter, they saw each other in person again only once or twice over the course of three years, despite having lived only about 35 miles (55 km) away from each other in the Boston suburbs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=La Miere|first1=Jason|title=WHO IS MICHELLE CARTER?

Roy also made some videos of himself talking to camera, which formed an important part of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texting-trial-conrad-roy-suicide-videos-friend-michelle-carter-manslaughter-trial/|title=Videos of Conrad Roy now key evidence in texting suicide trial|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was born on August 11, 1996, in Massachusetts to Gail and David Carter. She went to [[King Philip Regional High School]], Wrentham.

According to court documents, Roy had allegedly been physically hit by his father and verbally abused by his grandfather, and tried to kill himself in October 2012 while despondent after his parents divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/judge-hears-two-different-portraits-of-plainville-woman-during-texting/article_24d9bf3d-1693-5870-ae5e-2f9db0da459a.html|title=Judge hears two different portraits of Plainville woman during texting-suicide trial|last=dlinton@thesunchronicle.com|first=David Linton|work=The Sun Chronicle|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT00" /&gt; After learning that he was planning to kill himself, Carter repeatedly discouraged him from committing suicide in 2012 and 2014 and encouraged him to "get professional help". However, her attitude changed in July 2014, when she started thinking that it would be a "good thing to help him die".&lt;ref name="NYT00" /&gt; In June, Roy had texted Carter suggesting they act like [[Romeo and Juliet]], checking that she understood they had each killed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/boston/index.ssf/2017/06/if_they_read_my_messages_to_hi.html|title=Michelle Carter trial: Was Conrad Roy 'Romeo' or a 'pawn?' Defense and prosecution clash in opening statements|work=masslive.com|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors claimed that Carter had sought public attention from her boyfriend's death, and their putative relationship was almost entirely online rather than in-person.  The suggestibility and vulnerability of Roy, a minor at the time, has been an issue.

Carter's defense lawyers argued that Roy had a history of suicide attempts and the decision to end his life was his own,&lt;ref name="Cosmo061217"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2017/06/12/defense-michelle-carter-who-sent-texts-urging-suicide-was-a-very-troubled-youngster|title=Defense: Michelle Carter was a ‘very troubled youngster|date=16 June 2017|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners|agency=Cosmopolitan|last1=Associated Press|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Carter was "bewildered" over the case against her, and that, "Taking all the texts in context, she tried to talk him out of it... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/lawyer-plainville-teen-bewildered-over-involuntary-manslaughter-charges-in-friend/article_ba5a8a3e-e9d9-11e4-b645-e7549f97c906.html Hand, J.

Roy had also been taking Celexa for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2016/07/29/attorney-for-teen-accused-of-encouraging-boyfriend-to-kill-himself-raises-questions-about-antidepressant|title=Attorney for teen accused of encouraging boyfriend to kill himself raises questions about antidepressant|date=2016-07-29|work=Boston.com|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[citalopram]] carries a [[boxed warning]] stating it may increase [[Suicidality|suicidal thinking and behavior]] in those under age 24.

=== Legal repercussions ===
The case is expected by some to set a [[legal precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/columnists/bob_mcgovern/2017/06/mcgovern_michelle_carter_case_set_to_make_legal_history McGovern, R.

'''Definitions of abortion''' vary from one source to another. [[Abortion]] has many definitions that can differ from each other in significant ways.

If these definitions conflict, as is the case with Missouri's Definition of Death and abortion regulation statutes, the state must amend the existing language to bring into concert the criteria defining these parameters. Each state should decide whether to accomplish this goal by changing its statute in which death is defined or by changing any other statute with conflicting criteria. |url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=16+Am.+J.+L.+and+Med.+555&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=932f3a95bef438065ab1a7a0fecf85e3 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of definitions==
The following is a partial list of definitions as stated by [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (OB/GYN) textbooks, dictionaries, and [[encyclopedias]]:

;Major OB/GYN textbooks
* The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] defines an "abortus" as "[a] fetus or embryo removed or expelled from the uterus during the first half of gestation—20 weeks or less, or in the absence of accurate dating criteria, born weighing &lt; 500 g." They also define "birth" as "[t]he complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus after 20 weeks' gestation. [...] in the absence of accurate dating criteria, fetuses weighing &lt;500 g are usually not considered births, but rather are termed abortuses for purposes of vital statistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cunningham|editor1-first=FG|editor2-last=Leveno|editor2-first=KJ|editor3-last=Bloom|editor3-first=SL|editor4-last=Hauth|editor4-first=JC|editor5-last=Rouse|editor5-first=DJ|editor6-last=Spong|editor6-first=CY|chapter=1.

The terms 'spontaneous abortion' and 'miscarriage' are synonymous and are defined as loss of the fetus before the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. This definition implies a legal perception of the age at which a fetus can survive out of the womb.

He had been a member of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]'s (CPI(M)) politburo since 1978. Born in [[Sakthikulangara]], [[Kollam District]], he was the son of Raman and Eswary Balandan.

Balanandan initiated his political career in the [[Indian National Congress]], but he later joined the [[Communist Party of India]] in 1943, and then the CPI(M) in 1964.

From 1967 to 1977, he was a member of the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]]. In 1980, he was elected for a four-year term to the [[7th Lok Sabha]], the lower house of India's [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of India|parliament]] from [[Mukundapuram (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mukundapuram constituency]]. He was elected to the upper house, [[Rajya Sabha]] twice in 1988 and 1994.

Balanandan was the President of the [[Centre of Indian Trade Unions]] and of the Electricity Employees' Federation of India.

Balanandan died on 19 January 2009 at a private hospital in Kochi in Kerala, where he was admitted due to respiratory illness. He had suffered from lung cancer for some time.&lt;ref name=Keralaonline/&gt;

{{Euthanasia}}
A '''euthanasia device''' is a machine engineered to allow an individual to die quickly with minimal pain. The most common devices are those designed to help [[terminally ill]] people die by [[voluntary euthanasia]] or [[assisted suicide]] without prolonged [[pain]]. They may be operated by a second party, such as a [[physician]], or by the person wishing to die. There is an ongoing debate on the [[ethics]] of euthanasia and the use of euthanasia devices.

==Notable devices==

===Thanatron===
Invented by [[Jack Kevorkian]], to use this device and called it a "Thanatron" or death machine after the Greek [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]], [[Thanatos]]. It worked by pushing a button to deliver the euthanizing drugs mechanically through an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]]. It had three canisters mounted on a metal frame. Each bottle had a [[syringe]] that connected to a single IV line in the person's arm. One contained [[saline (medicine)|saline]], another contained a sleep-inducing [[barbiturate]] called [[sodium thiopental]] and the third a lethal mixture of [[potassium chloride]], which immediately stopped the heart, and [[pancuronium bromide]], a paralytic medication to prevent spasms during the dying process.&lt;ref name="lopes1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dying with Dignity: A Legal Approach to Assisted Death: A Legal Approach to Assisted Death|last=Lopes|date=2015-04-28|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-1440830976|location=Santa Barbara, California; Denver, Colorado|page=5|first1=Giza}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2016-04-18 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two deaths were assisted with this method.

===Mercitron===
Kevorkian assisted others with a device that employed a [[gas mask]] fed by a canister of [[carbon monoxide]] which was called "Mercitron" (mercy machine).&lt;ref name="lopes1" /&gt; This became necessary because Kevorkian's medical license had been revoked after the first two deaths, and he could no longer have legal access to the substances required for the "Thanatron". It was a rudimentary device consisting of a canister of carbon monoxide attached to a face mask with a tube. A valve must be released to start the gas flowing. Depending on the person's disability, a makeshift handle may be attached to the valve to make it easier to turn. Or, with the valve in the "open" position, a clip or clothespin could be clamped on the tubing. Pulling it off allows the gas to flow. By Kevorkian's estimates, this method took 10 minutes or longer. Sometimes he encouraged people to take sedatives or muscle relaxants to keep them calm as they breathed deeply of the gas.

===Deliverance Machine===
[[File:Euthanasia machine (Australia).JPG|thumb|340px|Philip Nitschke's "Deliverance Machine"]]

The Deliverance Machine was invented by [[Philip Nitschke]]. It consisted of software entitled Deliverance, that came on a special laptop that could be connected to an IV in a person's arm. The computer program asked a series of questions to confirm the person's intent to die. After answering affirmatively to all of the questions, a [[lethal injection]] of [[barbiturate]]s was triggered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB835824113352032000?mod=googlewsj|title=Death by Computer|publisher=online.wsj.com|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Nitschke said that, even if it had been legal for a doctor to give a lethal injection, he preferred that the patient be in control of the administration of the drugs. Reducing the role of a physician also allowed a patient to be alone with their family during the euthanasia process.&lt;ref name=lopez&gt;{{cite|author=Kathryn Jean Lopez|title=Euthanasia Sets Sail An interview with Philip Nitschke, the other “Dr. Death.”|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/420133/euthanasia-sets-sail-kathryn-jean-lopez|date=5 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine was used, legally, while the Australian [[Northern Territory]]'s [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]] was in effect; the act was eventually nullified by legislation of the Australian Parliament.&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt;

===Exit International's euthanasia device===
The [[EXIT (Australia)|Exit International]] euthanasia device was invented by [[Philip Nitschke]] in 2008. It uses a canister of [[nitrogen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24813754-2682,00.html|title=New death device to be launched in Adelaide|publisher=www.news.com.au|accessdate=2008-12-19|last=Wheatley|first=Kim|date=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[suicide bag|plastic suicide bag]], and a plastic tube with one end attached to the gas canister and the other fixed inside the bag by a tie held by adhesive tape.&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nitschke |first1=Philip |authorlink=Philip Nitschke |last2=Stewart |first2=Fiona |authorlink2=Fiona Stewart (author) |url=https://www.peacefulpillhandbook.com/ |title=The Peaceful Pill Handbook |publisher=Exit International US Ltd |date=2010 |isbn=978-0978878825 |accessdate=2016-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke said, "That idea of giving people access to a means of feeling that they're back in control of this issue is actually a way of prolonging life. It may seem paradoxical, but what we find is when people feel that they're back in control, they're less likely to do desperate things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/18/2449786.htm|title=Nitschke's suicide machine slammed |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], www.abc.net.au|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Background
The basic principle of autoeuthanasia by anoxia was first described in the book ''[[Final Exit]]'' by [[Derek Humphry]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=Humphry1991&gt;{{Cite book|last=Humphry|first=Derek|year=1991|title=Final Exit: the Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying|isbn=978-0-385-33653-6|publisher=Delta Trade Paperback|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original methodology was devised, using helium, by the ''NuTech'' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martindale |first=Diane |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-culture-of-death/ |title=A Culture of Death |work=[[Scientific American]] |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finalexit.org/ergo_nutech_new_technology.html |title=NuTech Report |work=ERGO |accessdate=2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Description
Nitschke described his device as a modification of the exit bag with helium method described in ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]''. Helium was replaced by a cylinder of compressed nitrogen and a regulator to supply the nitrogen into a plastic bag. One advantage of this method was the availability of larger amounts of nitrogen and flow rates last longer. Nitschke states that nitrogen is also more physiologically inert than helium, with less chance of adverse reaction,&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt; and that loss of consciousness is quick with death following within minutes.&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt; Unlike helium cylinders, nitrogen cylinders can be refilled in the event of leakage and nitrogen gas can't be detected during an autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-01-14/test-detects-suicides-from-natural-deaths/1208578 |title=Test detects suicides from natural deaths |work=ABC News |publisher=www.abc.net.au |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/euthanasia-group-to-show-west-aussies-how-to-die-well-20130503-2ixgd.html |title=Euthanasia group to show West Aussies how to die 'well' |author=Orr, Aleisha |date=3 May 2013 |work=WAToday|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Process
The principle behind the device is [[oxygen]] deprivation that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[asphyxia]] and death within minutes. Deprivation of oxygen in the presence of [[carbon dioxide]] creates panic and a sense of [[suffocation]] (the [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] alarm response), and struggling even when unconscious, whereas [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] in the presence of an [[inert gas]], like [[nitrogen]], [[helium]] or [[argon]], does not.&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Close contact with an enclosed inert gas is lethal, but released into the open air, it quickly disperses, and is safe for others. It is neither flammable nor explosive. Humphry's book describes close contact with the gas achieved by enclosing the head in a strong, clear plastic bag, secured around the neck, with the inert gas fed into the bag by plastic tubing.&lt;ref name="Humphry1991" /&gt;

Suicides using this method are documented in the forensic literature.&lt;ref name="pmid21394956"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard MO, Hall MT, Edwards JD, Vaughn MG, Perron BE, Winecker RE |title=Suicide by asphyxiation due to helium inhalation |journal=[[The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology]] |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=61–70 |year=2011 |pmid=21394956 |doi= 10.1097/paf.0b013e3181ed7a2d|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/78181/1/heliumsuicide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''Asphyxial suicide with helium and a plastic bag'' (Ogden et al.), the authors describe a typical case history, in which an elderly cancer sufferer used a plastic bag which was secured over her head, a [[helium]] tank, and a plastic hose attached to the tank valve and plastic bag.&lt;ref name="pmid12198347"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ogden |first1=Russel D. |last2=Wooten |first2=Rae H. |title=Asphyxial Suicide with Helium and a Plastic Bag |journal=American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=234–7 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12198347 |doi=10.1097/01.PAF.0000022963.33157.9B |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-7910&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=234|doi-broken-date=2018-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted that a suicide bag filled with helium will cause almost immediate unconsciousness, followed within minutes by death.&lt;ref name="pmid12198347" /&gt; Time to loss of consciousness in a bag filled with nitrogen is 15 seconds, according to professors Copeland, Pappas and Parr, who campaigned for a more humane execution method in the US state of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shuler |first=Jack |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/can-executions-be-more-humane/388249/ |title=Can Executions Be More Humane? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2015-03-20 |accessdate=2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarco machine===
In 2017 Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named "the Sarco machine".&lt;ref name="capsule"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overington |first=Caroline |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/philip-nitschke-invents-suicide-capsule-with-3d-printer/news-story/318561693f3a6eee1e10069df83a3839?nk=8a500b8067a5ef429d365255e635c3d2-1511568834 |title=Philip Nitschke invents suicide capsule with 3D printer |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=2017-11-25 |accessdate=2017-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarco capsule would contain a touchpad and nitrogen, and once an activation code is entered, "the person is again asked if they wish to die".&lt;ref name="capsule" /&gt; An affirmative answer causes nitrogen to flow into the capsule, displacing oxygen, and death follows shortly thereafter. The Sarco machine cannot be printed on small 3D printers. The Sarco offers a "euphoric death".&lt;ref name="hp2018" /&gt;

Nitschke plans to release the [[open-source model|open source]] plans for the Sarco by 2019.&lt;ref name="hp2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nitschke |first=Philip |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarco-death-philip-nitschke_us_5abbb574e4b03e2a5c7853ca |title=Here’s Why I Invented A ‘Death Machine’ That Lets People Take Their Own Lives |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2018-04-05 |accessdate=2018-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12531">The '''Evaporating Cloud''' is one of the six [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] in the [[Theory of Constraints]]. The Evaporating Cloud (EC) - also referred to in the literature as "the cloud", or as a "conflict resolution diagram"&lt;ref&gt;Dettmer, H,W. 1999. The conflict resolution diagram: Creating win-win solutions, Quality Progress,32(3):41&lt;/ref&gt; - is a logical diagram representing a problem that has no obvious satisfactory solution.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;Fedurko, Jelena. Behind the cloud: Enhancing logical thinking. TOC Strategic Solutions Ltd (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- need peer-reviewed examples/refs. This is internally published. --&gt;

== Overview ==
The most commonly used of the TOC tools,{{refn|group=note|name=note0|The EC is reported to be used in 77% of TOC case-studies, according to one report.&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;Kim, Seonmin, Victoria Jane Mabin, and John Davies. "The theory of constraints thinking processes: retrospect and prospect." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 28.2 (2008): 155-184.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the EC was designed to address conﬂict or [[dilemma]] situations (trade-off situations where there is no acceptable compromise) by diagramming the logic behind the conflict and methodically examining the assumptions behind the logic.
&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC has a set format with five boxes, labelled A, B, C, D, D’, that are usually laid out as follows:&lt;ref name=mabin2001&gt;Victoria J. Mabin, Steve Forgeson and Lawrence Green. Harnessing resistance: using the theory of constraints to assist change management. Journal of European Industrial Training. 25/2/3/4 [2001] 168±191&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Evaporating Cloud - Overview.svg|thumb|280px|The generic structure of an Evaporating Cloud diagram.]]

    [B] ← [D ]                      [A]
   /       ↑                       /   \
 [A]       conflict      OR      [B]   [C]
   \       ↓                      ↑     ↑
    [C] ← [D’]                   [D] ↔ [D’]

The boxes represent two opposing ''wants'' that represent the conflict (D, D’){{refn|group=note|The conflict can take the form of either "do this vs don't do this", or "do action 1 vs do action 2" where both actions can't be done at once.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=10}} }}, the ''needs'' that each want is trying to satisfy (B, C), and a common ''objective'' or goal (A) that both needs are trying to fulfil.{{refn|group=note|For example, a cloud based on an airlines case study&lt;ref name=polito2006&gt;Polito, Tony, Kevin Watson, and Robert J. Vokurka. "Using the theory of constraints to improve competitiveness: an airline case study." Competitiveness Review: An International Business Journal incorporating Journal of Global Competitiveness 16.1 (2006): 44-50.&lt;/ref&gt; has the conflict (D vs D’) stated as "minimize service costs" vs "do not minimize service costs." The needs (B, C) are stated respectively as "have the least cost" and "have superior service", with the common objective (A) being to "provide quality".}}

The lines or arrows connecting the nodes represent the rationale or causal assumptions that are used to link the nodes. When communicating the cloud, the arrows should be read as “in order to” or “because” or “so that”. For example: ''“In order to achieve '''A''' we require '''B''' because there is no way we can have '''A''' without '''B'''.”'' Or: ''“There is no way we can have '''D''' and have '''D’''' ''(read as "D-prime")'' at the same time.”''

== Origin of Name ==
According to Scheinkopf (2002) the Evaporating Cloud is so named in honor of [[Richard Bach]]. In Bach's 1977 book ''[[Illusions_(Bach_novel)|Illusions]]'', the main characters remove storm clouds from the sky by thinking them away.
:''If you really want to remove a cloud from your life, you do not make a big production out of it, you just relax and remove it from your thinking. That’s all there is to it.''&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Richard, Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah. Dell Publishing, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Evaporating Cloud tool is intended to similarly "vapourize" difficult problems by resolving an underlying conflict.
:''[Goldratt teaches] that every problem is a conﬂict, and that conﬂicts arise because we create them by believing at least one erroneous assumption. Thus, simply by thinking about the assumptions that enforce the existence of a conﬂict, we should be able to resolve any conﬂict by evaporating it with the power of our thinking.''&lt;ref&gt;Scheinkopf, Lisa J. Thinking for a change: Putting the TOC thinking processes to use. CRC Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps in problem solving ==
The general process for applying an EC to problem solving is described by Cohen (2010) as follows:&lt;ref name="handbook24"&gt;James F. Cox III, Ph.D, CFPIM, CIRM; John G. Schleier, Jr.: Theory of Constraints Handbook. Daily Management with TOC, Chapter (McGraw-Hill Professional, 2010), AccessEngineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=676}}
# Identify the type of problem (there are variations in the way the diagrams are constructed for different types of problems.)
# Write a storyline of this problem in a factual, objective way, even if the problem causes an emotional upset.
# Build the Cloud (see example guides below).
# Check the logical statements of the Cloud and make necessary corrections and upgrades.
# Surface the assumptions behind the logical connections to find the one that is supporting the conflict.{{refn|group=note|Usually the best connections to examine are the ones between C-D′ or B-D. While addressing the D-D′ connection is ideal, it is not usually feasible.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=681-684}} }}
# Construct your solution and check it for win-win.
# Communicate the solution to the people involved in dealing with the problem.

Clouds are "built" by filling in the appropriate boxes with statements about the situation. Both the wording of the statements and the sequence of filling the boxes can be important. Below is a guide to the recommended sequence and questions for building ''Day-to-day Conflict'' or ''Inner Dilemma'' clouds.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=679, 689}}

Different types of problems have slightly different requirements when it comes to documenting and communicating the underlying conflict.

== Example ==
Goldratt has illustrated the use of the evaporating cloud technique in a discussion of the [[Economic production quantity]] model.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990&gt;E.M. Goldratt. What is this thing called the Theory of Constraints and how is it implemented? North River Press: Crofton-on-Hudson NY, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=43}} The prerequisite wants are to ''run large batches'' (D) and yet to ''run small batches'' (D’). These are clearly in conflict. The required need that D is trying to meet is to ''reduce setup cost'' (B), whereas the D’ prerequisite needs to ''reduce carrying cost per unit'' (C). Both requirements are aimed at the objective (A): to ''reduce cost per unit''.

[[Image:Evaporating Cloud Example.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|EC example illustrating the problem of the Economic Batch Quantity.]]
Fedurko (2011) recommends checking the logic of the EC by reading the logical statements aloud, in the following sequence:&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|pages=13, 22}}
#In order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run ''large'' batches.
#in order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce carrying cost per unit we must run ''small'' batches.
#Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict.
#Running ''large'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#Running ''small'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.

According to Fedurko,
:''Reading aloud ... is needed because it explicitly employs the auditory channel as an additional mechanism to process and check the logic.''&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|page=13}}

Goldratt claims that each of the logical connections in the EC represent an (often hidden) assumption.
:''One of the most basic fundamentals of logic is, that behind any logical connection there is an assumption.''&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|page=47}}

The assumptions behind the above connections can be surfaced by again reading the statements with a "because" clause added.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011/&gt;{{rp|page=31}} For example, Goldratt surfaces the following assumptions behind the 2nd statement in the example EC:
*In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run large batches, ''because''
*#setup cost is fixed and can't be reduced.
*#the machine being set up is a bottleneck with no spare capacity.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=48-50}}
And again, with the 5th statement:
*Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict, ''because'':
*#large is the opposite of small.
*#there is only one meaning to the word "batch".&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=50-51}}

The second assumption is challenged by distinguishing between ''production batch'' size (between setups) and ''transfer batch'' size (between workstations), and so allowing different sized batches for different purposes.

== Core Conflict Cloud ==
The '''Core Conflict Cloud''' is an Evaporating Cloud that emerges from analysis of a [[current reality tree (Theory of constraints)|current reality tree]] (CRT), which is one of the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]]. The CRT provides a way for analyzing many system or organizational problems at once, treating them as symptoms of a single core problem.
If an easy solution to such a core problem has not already been implemented, it is likely there is some conflict in the organization that is blocking implementation.&lt;ref name=tocma&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Core Conflict Cloud is to address this inherent conflict that is preventing the sorting out of the core problem.&lt;ref name=handbook24/&gt;{{rp|page=710}}

The '''First Call vehicle''' is a [[vehicle]] used in the [[funeral]] service industry.  This type of vehicle is used to pick up the remains of a recently deceased person, and transport that person to the [[funeral home]] for preparation.  This initial pickup is called the "first call", hence the name of these vehicles.  While some funeral homes will use the [[hearse]] for these initial pickups, having vehicles for first calls and using the hearse solely for funerals reduces wear on hearses and makes the first call process more discreet.

Today, the vehicles usually used for this service  are [[minivans]].  In some cases, funeral homes purchase minivans that have been converted into first call vehicles by the same companies that produce hearses.  In other cases, general purpose minivans are purchased without the rear seats installed.  

In the United States, larger [[SUV]]s such as the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Ford Excursion]] have been employed. Their large [[wheelbase]], [[pickup truck]]-derived [[chassis]] and larger engines make them popular, well suited to their purpose and requiring little alteration.  From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, full-sized [[station wagons]] such as the [[Chevrolet Caprice]], [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Ford LTD (North America)|Ford LTD]] were popular options as well.  Conversion on these ranged from [[Window film|tinting]] or blacking-out the rear windows, and installing a metal deck (or sometimes, just bars) to secure the stretcher or casket, to having the rear section modified as a [[landau (car)|landau]] and the installation of a casket tray, similar to a hearse.  Many of these remain in service.

It is not uncommon for older hearses to be employed as a first call vehicle. This often makes sense for the funeral home when a new hearse is purchased, as opposed to purchasing a second new vehicle.

The First Call vehicle is sometimes operated by an outside company that has contracts with various mortuaries and funeral homes, rather than by the funeral homes. In the [[UK]], these are known as "private ambulances"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Model_Tender_Specification_for_Removal_of_Deceased.pdf|title=Model Tender Specification for Removal of Deceased|website=[[Human Tissue Authority]]|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43859">[[File:Functional Electrical Stimulation .tif|thumb|Functional Electrical Stimulation - Schematic Representation: Illustration of motor neuron stimulation. (a) The cell nucleus is responsible for synthesizing input from dendrites and deciding whether or not to generate signals. Following a stroke or spinal cord injury, muscles are impaired because motor neurons no longer receive sufficient input from the central nervous system.

'''Functional electrical stimulation''' ('''FES''') is a technique that uses low energy electrical pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals who have been paralyzed due to injury to the [[central nervous system]]. More specifically, FES can be used to generate [[muscle]] contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), [[head injury]], [[stroke]] and other [[neurological disorder]]s. In other words, a consumer would use the device each time he/she wanted to generate a desired function.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;M.R. Popovic, K. Masani and S. Micera, "Chapter 9 – Functional Electrical Stimulation Therapy: Recovery of function following spinal cord injury and stroke," In press, Neurorehabilitation Technology – Second Edition, Z. Rymer, T. Nef and V. Dietz, Ed. Springer Science Publishers in November 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; FES is sometimes also referred to as [[neuromuscular electrical stimulation]] ^([[NMES]]).&lt;ref&gt;M. Claudia et al., (2000), Artificial Grasping System for the Paralyzed Hand, International Society for Artificial Organs, Vol 24 No.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years FES technology has been used to deliver therapies to retrain voluntary motor functions such as grasping, reaching and walking. In this embodiment, FES is used as a short-term therapy, the objective of which is restoration of voluntary function and not lifelong dependence on the FES device, hence the name '''functional electrical stimulation therapy''', '''FES therapy''' ('''FET''' or '''FEST'''). In other words, the FEST is used as a short-term intervention to help the central nervous system of the consumer to re-learn how to execute impaired functions, instead of making the consumer dependent on neuroprostheses for the rest of her/his life.&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Nagai, C. Marquez-Chin, and M.R. Popovic, "Why is functional electrical stimulation therapy capable of restoring motor function following severe injury to the central nervous system?"

==Principles==

{{Medical citations needed|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Neuron]]s are electrically active [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, John Hall, 13th edition, Elsevier Health Sciences, May 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In neurons, information is coded and transmitted as a series of electrical impulses called [[action potential]]s, which represent a brief change in cell electric potential of approximately 80–90 mV. Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12&amp;nbsp;Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Popovic and T.A. Thrasher, "Neuroprostheses," in Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, G.E. Wnek and G.L. Bowlin, Eds.: Marcel Dekker, Inc., vol. 2, pp. 1056-1065, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

FES devices take advantage of this property to electrically activate nerve cells, which then may go on to activate muscles or other nerves.&lt;ref&gt;Control of Movement for the Physically Disabled: Control for Rehabilitation Technology, Dejan Popovic and Thomas Sinkjaer, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, December 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, special care must be taken in designing safe FES devices, as passing electric current through tissue can lead to adverse effects such as decrease in excitability or cell death. This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or overexcitation of the targeted neutrons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and [[nerve]]s. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate [[muscle]]s, if their [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles).&lt;ref&gt;Reichel M, Breyer T, Mayr W, and Rattay F. Simulation of the three-dimensional electrical field in the course of functional electrical stimulation. Artificial Organs 26: 252–255, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves—descending nerves from the [[central nervous system]] to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves—ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).

The electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex [[reflex]]es. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.

When a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the [[axon]]. Typically, one "wave" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other "wave" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Rushton D. Functional electrical stimulation and rehabilitation—an hypothesis. Med Eng Phys 25: 75–78, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.

In the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor [[withdrawal reflex]]. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor [[withdrawal reflex]] to facilitate walking in individuals following [[stroke]], or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term ''[[neuromodulation]]''.

Nerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the [[skin]] surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be "activated". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.

(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator, which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems.)

A major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuhn A, Keller T, Micera S, Morari  | year = 2009 | title = a simulation study | url = | journal = Medical engineering &amp; physics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 945–951 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Micera S, Keller T, Lawrence M, Morari M, Popović DB | year = 2010 | title = Wearable neural prostheses.

Subcutaneous electrodes can be divided into [[percutaneous]] and implanted electrodes. The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as [[Cleveland FES Center]], have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.

The other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.

Typical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping,&lt;ref&gt;Popovic MR, Thrasher TA, Zivanovic P, Takaki M, and Hajek P.

==History==

FES was initially referred to as Functional Electrotherapy by Liberson,&lt;ref name="Liberson1961"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liberson | first1 = W. T. | last2 = Holmquest | first2 = H. J. | last3 = Scot | first3 = D. | last4 = Dow | first4 = M. | title = Functional electrotherapy: Stimulation of the peroneal nerve synchronized with the swing phase of the gait of hemiplegic patients | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 42 | pages = 101–105 | year = 1961 | pmid = 13761879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1967 that the term Functional Electrical Stimulation was coined by Moe and Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moe J. H., Post H. W. | year = 1962 | title = Functional electrical stimulation for ambulation in hemiplegia | pmid = 14474974 | journal = The Journal-lancet | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 285–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in a patent entitled, "Electrical stimulation of muscle deprived of nervous control with a view of providing muscular contraction and producing a functionally useful moment".&lt;ref&gt;Offner et al. (1965), Patent 3,344,792&lt;/ref&gt; Offner's patent described a system used to treat [[foot drop]].

The first commercially available FES devices treated foot drop by stimulating the peroneal nerve during gait. In this case, a switch, located in the heel end of a user's shoe, would activate a stimulator worn by the user.

== Common applications ==

=== Spinal cord injury ===
Injuries to the spinal cord interfere with electrical signals between the brain and the muscles, resulting in paralysis below the level of injury. Restoration of limb function as well as regulation of organ function are the main application of FES, although FES is also used for treatment of pain, pressure, sore prevention, etc. Some examples of FES applications involve the use of [[Neuroprostheses]] that allow the people with [[paraplegia]] to walk, stand, restore hand grasp function in people with [[quadriplegia]], or restore bowel and bladder function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pow–ell|first=Joanna|author2=David Pandyan |author3=Malcolm Granat |author4=Margart Cameron |author5=David Stott |title=Electrical Stimulation of Wrist Extensors in Poststroke Hemiplegia|journal=Stroke|year=1999|volume=30|pages=1384–1389|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/30/7/1384|accessdate=11 May 2011|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; High intensity FES of the quadriceps muscles allows patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion to increase their muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, improve ultrastructural organization of contractile material, increase of force output during electrical stimulation and perform FES assisted stand-up exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kern H, Carraro U, Adami N, Biral D, Hofer C, Forstner C, Mödlin M, Vogelauer M, Pond A, Boncompagni S, Paolini C, Mayr W, Protasi F, Zampieri S |title=Home-based functional electrical stimulation rescues permanently denervated muscles in paraplegic patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion.|journal=Neurorehabil Neural Repair|year=2010|volume=24|issue=8|pages=709–721|doi=10.1177/1545968310366129|pmid=20460493}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Walking in spinal cord injury ====
Kralj and his colleagues described a technique for paraplegic gait using surface stimulation, which remains the most popular method in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Kralj A, Bajd T, and Turk R. "Enhancement of gait restoration in spinal injured patients by functional electrical stimulation. ''Clin Orthop Relat Res'' 1988; 34-43&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graupe D, Davis R, Kordylewski H, Kohn K | year = 1998 | title = Ambulation by traumatic T4-12 paraplegics using functional neuromuscular stimulation | url = | journal = Crit Rev Neurosurg | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–231 | doi=10.1007/s003290050081}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kralj’s approach was extended by Graupe et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graupe D, Davis R, Kordylewski H, Kohn K | year = 1998 | title = Ambulation by traumatic T4-12 paraplegics using functional neuromuscular stimulation | url = | journal = Crit Rev Neurosurg | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–231 | doi=10.1007/s003290050081}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a digital FES system that employs the power of digital signal processing to result in the Parastep FES system, based on US Patents 5,014,705 (1991), 5,016,636 (1991), 5,070,873 (1991), 5,081,989 (1992), 5,092,329 (1992) and related foreign patents.   The Parastep system became the first FES system for standing and walking to receive the US FDA approval (FDA, PMA P900038, 1994) and become commercially available.

The Parastep’s digital design allows a considerable reduction in rate of patient-fatigue by drastically reducing of stimulation pulse-width (100-140 microseconds) and pulse-rate (12-24 per sec.), to result, in walking times of 20-60 minutes and average walking distances of 450 meters per walk, for adequately trained thoracic-level complete paraplegics patients who complete training that includes daily treadmill sessions   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graupe D, Davis R, Kordylewski H, Kohn K | year = 1998 | title = Ambulation by traumatic T4-12 paraplegics using functional neuromuscular stimulation | url = | journal = Crit Rev Neurosurg | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–231 | doi=10.1007/s003290050081}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with some patients exceeding one mile per walk ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AKlSzEwhsg).  Also, Parestep-based walking was reported  to result in several medical and psychological benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood flow to lower extremities and holding of bone density decline &lt;ref&gt;[{cite journal = | author = Nash N S, Jacobs P L, Montalvo B M, Klose K J, Guest B, Needham-Shroshire M | year = 1997 | title = Evaluation of a training program for persons with SCI paraplegia using the Parastep®1 ambulation system: Part 5.

Walking performance with the Parastep system greatly depends on rigorous upper body conditioning-training and on a completing 3-5 months of a daily one/two hours training program which includes 30 of more minutes of treadmill training &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graupe D, Davis R, Kordylewski H, Kohn K | year = 1998 | title = Ambulation by traumatic T4-12 paraplegics using functional neuromuscular stimulation | url = | journal = Crit Rev Neurosurg | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–231 | doi=10.1007/s003290050081}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


An alternative approach to the above techniques is the FES system for walking developed using the Compex Motion neuroprosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Popovic MR, Keller T | year = 2005 | title = Modular transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation system | url = | journal = Medical engineering &amp; physics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 81–92 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2004.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thrasher TA, Flett HM, Popovic MR | year = 2006 | title = Gait training regimen for incomplete spinal cord injury using functional electrical stimulation | url = | journal = Spinal Cord | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 357–361 | doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3101864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compex Motion neuroprosthesis for walking is an eight to sixteen channel surface FES system used to restore voluntary walking in stroke and spinal cord injury individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapadia N., Masani K., Craven B.C., Giangregorio L.M., Hitzig S.L., Richards K., Popovic M.R. | year = 2014 | title = A randomized trial of functional electrical stimulation for walking in incomplete spinal cord injury: Effects on walking competency | url = | journal = The Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 511–524 | doi=10.1179/2045772314y.0000000263| pmc = 4166186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system does not apply peroneal nerve stimulation to enable locomotion. Instead, it activates all relevant lower limb muscles in a sequence similar to the one that brain uses to enable locomotion. The hybrid assistive systems (HAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Popovic D, Tomović R, Schwirtlich L | year = 1989 | title = Hybrid assistive system--the motor neuroprosthesis | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 729–737 | doi=10.1109/10.32105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the RGO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Solomonow M, Baratta R, Hirokawa S, Rightor N, Walker W, Beaudette P, Shoji H, D'Ambrosia R | year = 1989 | title = The RGO Generation II: muscle stimulation powered orthosis as a practical walking system for thoracic paraplegics | url = | journal = Orthopedics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 1309–1315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; walking neuroprostheses are devices that also apply active and passive braces, respectively. The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Triolo RJ, Bieri C, Uhlir J, Kobetic R, Scheiner A, Marsolais EB | year = 1996 | title = Implanted Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation systems for individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries: clinical case reports | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 1119–1128 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(96)90133-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kobetic R, To CS, Schnellenberger JR, Audu ML, Bulea TC, Gaudio R, Pinault G, Tashman S, Triolo RJ | year = 2009 | title = Development of hybrid orthosis for standing, walking, and stair climbing after spinal cord injury | url = | journal = Journal of rehabilitation research and development | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 447–462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies have been found to be successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.

=== Stroke and upper limb recovery ===
In the acute stage of [[stroke]] recovery, the use of cyclic electrical stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist extensors.  In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant [[hemiplegia]].  Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist extensors must be highly motivated to follow through with [[therapy|treatment]], After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent.  Many scales, which assess the level of  [[disability]] of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item.  Therefore, increasing strength of wrist extensors will decrease the level of upper extremity disability.

Patients with [[hemiplegia]] following a stroke commonly experience shoulder pain and subluxation; both of which will interfere with the rehabilitation process.  Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery.  Furthermore, the benefits of FES are maintained over time; research has demonstrated that the benefits are maintained for at least 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chantraine|first=Alex|author2=Baribeault, Alain|author3= Uebelhart, Daniel|author4= Gremion, Gerald|title=Shoulder Pain and Dysfunction in Hemiplegia: Effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=1999|volume=80|pages=328–331|doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drop foot ===
[[Foot drop|Drop foot]] is a common symptom in [[Hemiparesis|hemiplegia]], characterized by a lack of dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, resulting in short, shuffling strides. It has been shown that FES can be used to effectively compensate for the drop foot during the swing phase of the gait. At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Taylor PN, Burridge JH, Dunkerley AL, Wood DE, Norton JA, Singleton C, Swain ID | year = 1999 | title = Clinical use of the Odstock dropped foot stimulator: its effect on the speed and effort of walking | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 80 | issue = 12| pages = 1577–1583 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90333-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein RB, Everaert DG, Thompson AK, Chong SL, Whittaker M, Robertson J, Kuether G (2010) Long-term therapeutic and orthotic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance in progressive and nonprogressive neurological disorders.

Artificial Organs 26 (3):267-270&lt;/ref&gt; Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as [[stroke]], [[spinal cord injury]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].

The term "orthotic effect" can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a "training" or "therapeutic effect" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off.  A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called "temporary carry over effect". Liberson et al., 1961&lt;ref name="Liberson1961" /&gt; was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off.  It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect.

=== Stroke ===
Hemiparetic stroke patients, who are impacted by the denervation, muscular atrophy, and spasticity, typically experience an abnormal gait pattern due to muscular weakness and the incapacity to voluntary contract certain ankle and hip muscles at the appropriate walking phase. Liberson et al., (1961) were the first to pioneer FES in stroke patients.&lt;ref name="Liberson1961" /&gt;  More recently, there have been a number of studies that have been conducted in this area. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the use of FES in chronic stroke included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 231 participants.  The review found a small treatment effect for using FES for the 6 minute walking test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Shelialah|last2=Mehta|first2=Swati|last3=McIntyre|first3=Amanda|last4=Lobo|first4=Liane|last5=Teasell|first5=Robert W.|date=2012-12-01|title=Functional electrical stimulation for improving gait in persons with chronic stroke|journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation|volume=19|issue=6|pages=491–498|doi=10.1310/tsr1906-491|issn=1074-9357|pmid=23192714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
FES has also been found to be useful for treating foot drop in people with [[multiple sclerosis]]. The first use was reported in 1977 by Carnstam et al., who found that it was possible to generate strength increases through using peroneal stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=1088368 | volume=11 | title=Electrical stimulation in multiple sclerosis | year=1976 | author=Cook AW | journal=Hosp Pract | pages=51–8 | doi=10.1080/21548331.1976.11706516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnstam|first=B.|last2=Larsson|first2=L.

With NMES treatment there were measurable gains in ambulatory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21138391|doi = 10.1089/acm.2010.0080 | volume=16 | title=Rehabilitation with neuromuscular electrical stimulation leads to functional gains in ambulation in patients with secondary progressive and primary progressive multiple sclerosis: a case series report | year=2010 | author=Wahls TL, Reese D, Kaplan D, Darling WG | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=1343–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a further large observational study (n=187) was supportive of previous findings and found a significant improvement in orthotic effect for walking speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=Tamsyn|last2=Taylor|first2=Paul|last3=Swain|first3=Ian|date=2015-04-01|title=Effectiveness of functional electrical stimulation on walking speed, functional walking category, and clinically meaningful changes for people with multiple sclerosis|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=96|issue=4|pages=667–672|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2014.11.017|issn=1532-821X|pmid=25499688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cerebral palsy ===
FES has been found to be useful for treating the symptoms of [[cerebral palsy]].  A recent randomised controlled trial (n=32) found significant orthotic and training effects for children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.  Improvements were found in gastrocnemius spasticity, community mobility and balance skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pool|first=Dayna|last2=Valentine|first2=Jane|last3=Bear|first3=Natasha|last4=Donnelly|first4=Cyril J.|last5=Elliott|first5=Catherine|last6=Stannage|first6=Katherine|date=2015-01-01|title=The orthotic and therapeutic effects following daily community applied functional electrical stimulation in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy: a randomised controlled trial|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|pages=154|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0472-y|issn=1471-2431|pmc=4603297|pmid=26459358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent comprehensive literature review of the area of using electrical stimulation and FES to treat children with disabilities mostly included studies on children with cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosques|first=Glendaliz|last2=Martin|first2=Rebecca|last3=McGee|first3=Leah|last4=Sadowsky|first4=Cristina|date=2016-05-31|title=Does therapeutic electrical stimulation improve function in children with disabilities?

The review further concludes that adverse events were rare and the technology is safe and well tolerated by this population.

=== National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines (NICE) (UK) ===
[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] have issued full guidelines on the treatment of drop foot of central neurological origin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg278|title=Functional electrical stimulation for drop foot of central neurological origin {{!}} Guidance and guidelines {{!}} NICE|website=www.nice.org.uk|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IPG278). NICE have stated that "current evidence on the safety and efficacy (in terms of improving gait) of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for drop foot of central neurological origin appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit".

He was born in [[Lancashire]] and was educated in [[Mansfield]] and [[Birmingham]]. Herod came to Guelph in 1840. He studied medicine with two physicians there and then continued his studies at [[University of Toronto|King's College]], [[Toronto]] and was admitted to practice in 1847. He became a physician at the Emigrant Hospital in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and set up practice in [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]] a year later. In 1854, Herod returned to Guelph and entered practice with Dr. [[William Clarke (Guelph doctor)|William Clarke]]. Herod served as county [[coroner]], as surgeon for the jail and as surgeon for the county militia. He was also a member of the town council and of the local school board.&lt;ref name=medical/&gt;

'''Susan Oluwabimpe "Goldie" Filani Harvey''' (23 October 1981 – 14 February 2013) was a [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] professional singer and a [[Big Brother Africa]] star.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigerian singer Susan 'Goldie' Harvey dies in Lagos|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21471191|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''guilty pleasure''' is something, such as a film, a television program or a piece of music, that one enjoys despite understanding that it is not generally held in high regard, or is seen as unusual or weird. For example, a person may secretly like a movie but will admit that particular movie is poorly made and/or generally seen as "not good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/loves-evolver/201005/why-its-good-feel-guilty|title=Why It's Good to Feel Guilty|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=May 14, 2010|first=Maryanne|last=Fisher|work=[[Psychology Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/against-guilty-pleasure|title=Against "Guilty Pleasure"|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Szalai|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fashion]], [[video game]]s, [[music]], [[theatre]], [[television series]], [[Movie|films]], [[food]] and [[fetishes]] can be examples of guilty pleasures.

'''John Francis Duff''' (January 17, 1895 – January 8, 1958) was a Canadian [[Auto racing|racecar driver]] who won many races and has been inducted in the [[Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhf.ca/member_JOHN_DUFF.html CMHF Citation]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only two Canadians who raced and won on England’s famous [[Brooklands]] Motor Course. The other, [[Kay Petre]], is already an honoured member of the CMHF. Duff was the first Canadian to race in the legendary [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. To date, he is the only Canadian to win the overall classification at Le Mans.

Duff also held over fifty world records for speed and endurance. Those records were sanctioned by the [[AIACR]], the forerunner of today’s [[FIA]]. They included both class and absolute records. His achievements helped make the name of the [[Bentley]] car company. Duff scored a top-ten finish in his first [[Indianapolis 500]] and a top-three in his first board track race. Those achievements make him one of the preeminent Canadian automobile racers of the first half of the twentieth century.

== Background ==
John Duff was born in [[Kiukiang]], [[China]]. His parents were Canadians from [[Hamilton, Ontario]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Globe and Mail'', January 7, 1927, Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; who established a commercial outpost in nearby Kuling. As a boy, the rambunctious young Duff was sent to Hamilton for a good Victorian education. He lived there until he was sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;See 1911 Census of Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Duff was back in Kuling. When [[World War I|war was declared]] in 1914, he travelled across [[Russia]] to [[England]], where he joined the army. Gravely wounded at the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], Duff was sent to a hospital in England where he met and married his nurse. In 1919, John Duff learned how to drive a car and became a dealer. In 1920, he started racing.

== Racing career ==
In 1920, Duff began his racing career at [[Brooklands]], a 2.6&amp;nbsp;mile long concrete track with concave banking. He drove a [[Fiat]] S.61, a 10-litre chain-driven car built in 1908. By August 1920, he was lapping in the same range as [[Henry Segrave]], one of the great Brooklands and Grand Prix drivers of the 1920s.

Driving the S.61, Duff won the 75 Long Handicap at Brooklands in May 1921 at a speed of 104.19&amp;nbsp;mph. He won the 100 Long Handicap at Brooklands’ mid-summer meeting, averaging 104.85&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the wide variety of racing machinery at Brooklands, and the fact that wagering was allowed, most races were run as handicaps.&lt;/ref&gt; Duff was the fastest on the track for both wins. He also lost a number of races where he was the fastest. As Duff’s driving skills improved, his reputation began to put him at a disadvantage with the handicappers.

In the off-season, Duff bought another old Fiat, the 18-litre pre-war racer called "Mephistopheles".&lt;ref&gt;The Story of "Mephistopheles" by Capt. J. F. Duff, ''The Brooklands Gazette'', April 1925, Pages 384–385.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, he took both Fiats to the [[Fanoe]] beach speed trials in [[Denmark]]. Duff set the fastest time of the meeting with a run at 165.9&amp;nbsp;km/h. He also took a class win with the S.61 at a speed of 149.2&amp;nbsp;km/h, the third fastest speed of the meeting.

In 1922, Duff sold the S.61 and focused on making Mephistopheles faster and more reliable. [[Harry Ricardo]] made a set of [[aluminum]] [[piston]]s and raised the [[engine]]’s compression ratio. In May, Duff finished third in Brooklands’ 100&amp;nbsp;Mile Handicap. In its next race, one of the Fiat’s [[engine block]]s detached from the [[crankcase]]. When the engine blew, the hood was torn off the car, just missing Duff’s head. Engine parts rained down on the track. Duff sold the car for scrap.

1922 saw the birth of Duff and Aldington, a dealership set up to sell the new [[Bentley]] car. Duff raced a Bentley at Brooklands. On August 28, he took a stock 3-litre model to the track where he made an attempt on the "Double Twelve" record (24&amp;nbsp;Hour runs were not allowed at Brooklands due to the noise). The car broke before he could achieve that goal but, in the process, Duff set new Class E world records for 1, 2, and 3&amp;nbsp;hours, 100 and 200&amp;nbsp;miles, and 100, 200, 300, and 400&amp;nbsp;km.

Duff returned to Brooklands on September 27–28, driving both 12&amp;nbsp;hour shifts singlehanded to take the Double 12 &lt;ref&gt;''Brooklands Gazette'', July 1924, Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; at an average of 86.52&amp;nbsp;mph, for a total distance of 2,082&amp;nbsp;miles (3,351&amp;nbsp;km). He also broke the Class E world records for 1 to 12&amp;nbsp;hours and all distances from 100 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;miles and 100 to 1,600&amp;nbsp;km. In total, he set 38 international class records. The Double 12 record was an absolute record, regardless of class. The event was depicted on the cover picture of the first edition of the [[Motor Sport (magazine)|''Brooklands Gazette'']], published in July 1924.&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', August 1949, Page 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Brooklands’ autumn meeting, Duff appeared at the wheel of  [[J.L. Dunne]]’s old 21-litre Blitzen [[Karl Benz|Benz]]. He lost the 100&amp;nbsp;Mile Handicap to [[J. G. Parry-Thomas|Parry Thomas]], despite lapping at  114.49&amp;nbsp;mph. Unable to stop the old car at the end of the last lap, Duff shot over the top of the banking, crashing through trees and a telegraph pole outside the circuit before finally coming to rest.&lt;ref&gt;In our time, high performance is commonplace and mechanical durability is a given with most cars. In Duff’s time, that was not the case. Now, automobile speed records over long distances and times rarely make the news. In Duff’s day, endurance and speed records set over distances like one or two thousand miles, twelve or twenty-four hours, were considered remarkable achievements. They were covered by both the automotive and the general press. In the 1920s, Duff’s speed records played as big a role as his Le Mans victory in establishing the name and reputation of Bentley cars as reliable high-speed sports/touring machines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1923, Duff learned of a new 24&amp;nbsp;Hour race to be held at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. He was the first entrant. [[W. O. Bentley]], the founder and then-owner of Bentley Motors, thought it was madness and that no car would finish. In the face of Duff’s determination, he agreed to have the car prepared at the factory and let his test driver, [[Frank Clement (racecar driver)|Frank Clement]], partner Duff. The Duff/Clement Bentley was one of the fastest cars, Duff setting the fastest lap at 9 mins 39 sec for the 10.726 mile lap.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Fraichard, ''The Le Mans Story'', The Sportsman's Book Club, 1956, Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Rough track conditions took their toll as a flying stone holed the fuel tank, forcing Duff to run back to the pits. As only the drivers could work on the cars, Clement had to bicycle back with a can of gas to power the car back to the pits. Despite the drama, Duff and Clement finished a strong fourth.&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', November 1933, Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, W.O. Bentley, who only went over at the last minute, became hooked on Le Mans, the race that would make his cars famous.

Duff then took his Bentley to the Spanish Touring Car GP at [[Circuito Lasarte|Lasarte]]. Leading with two laps to go, he was hit in the face by a stone thrown up by a lapped car. Duff crashed into a wall, injuring his jaw and breaking some [[teeth]]. Despite that, he won first place in the 3 litre class, as he had easily outlasted and outdistanced his competition. "In token of his gallant drive Duff was awarded the 3-litre trophy anyway, there being no other finishers in the class." &lt;ref&gt;Cyril Posthumus, ''The Roaring Twenties, An Album of Early Motor Racing'', Page 44, Blandford Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924, Bentley was now fully committed to Le Mans. Duff was still a private entrant, using one of the dealership’s cars. His car was prepared alongside the works entry using ideas Duff had come up with after the 1923 race. Partnered by Clement, in a race run in intense heat, Duff won handily, giving Bentley its first victory at Le Mans. In 1925, a carburetor fire ended Duff’s chances at Le Mans.

On September 9–10, 1925, Duff went to the high-banked [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry|Montlhéry]] track, near [[Paris]], for an attempt at the absolute 24&amp;nbsp;Hour Record. He had a special single-seater [[Charles Terres Weymann|Weymann]] body on his Bentley and works driver [[Dudley Benjafield]] as his co-driver. In driving rain, they did the first 12&amp;nbsp;hours at 97.7&amp;nbsp;mph but missed the 12&amp;nbsp;hour record. At 18 ½ hours, the [[camshaft]] drive failed, ending the attempt. He was able to claim two world records: 1,000 Kilometres in 6 hrs, 23 mins, 55 secs and 1,000 miles in 10 hrs 15 mins 59secs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', September 20, 1925, Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, Duff returned to Montlhéry with [[Woolf Barnato]] as his co-driver. Driving on a damp track in heavy mist, they covered 2,280&amp;nbsp;miles in 24&amp;nbsp;hours, averaging 95.02&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', September 28, 1925, Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; They beat the previous record, held by the 9-litre [[Renault]] of Garfield and Plessier, by over 7&amp;nbsp;mph. Along the way, the 3-litre Bentley took 21 world records, including those for six and twelve hours, and 500, 1000, and 2000&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;ref&gt;Regaining the 24 Hours World's Record for Great Britain, by Captain John F. Duff, ''Motor Sport'', November 1925, Pages 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking for new challenges, Duff went to America in February 1926.&lt;ref&gt;''Aberdeen Daily News'', South Dakota, April 11, 1926, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed to drive a [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Miller]] sponsored by the [[Elcar]] Automobile Company in the [[Indianapolis 500]], following the death of Herbert Jones, who was killed attempting to qualify for the race in the Elcar Special.&lt;ref&gt;''Springfield Republican'', May 30, 1926, Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In a race shortened to 400&amp;nbsp;miles by rain, Duff finished 9th. The next AAA championship event was on the 1.25&amp;nbsp;mile [[board track racing|board track]] at [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] on June 12. Duff finished 3rd in the 250&amp;nbsp;mile race, two laps down.&lt;ref&gt;''Oregonian'', June 13, 1926, Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  The next race was on the Rockingham board track in [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]], [[New Hampshire]]. A puncture pitched Duff’s car sideways, throwing him from the car. "John Duff of Indianapolis, Ind., wrecked his machine and suffered a broken collar bone when his car crashed through the top rail and dropped clear of the track." &lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Daily Times'', July 6, 1926, Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Duff suffered painful bone and muscle injuries, and a concussion that affected his vision. Knowing that his competitiveness would be compromised, and having promised his wife that he would quit if he suffered another serious injury, Duff retired from racing.

== Later life ==
After the accident, Duff brought his family over from England. They settled in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], near [[Los Angeles]]. Duff opened a [[fencing]] academy where he trained many of the movie stars of the day. He doubled for his friend [[Gary Cooper]] and others in [[swordfighting]] scenes in [[Hollywood]] films. He also taught fencing at [[UCLA]]. In 1932, he coached some of his students on the [[U.S. Olympic team]]. When the [[Great Depression|Depression]] led to a decline in the demand for fencing instruction, Duff moved his family to China. The Duff family’s settlement at Kuling had prospered over the years and turned into a thriving resort. They stayed in China from 1932 to 1934, when they moved back to England. In January 1935 he became a member of the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted in the Club’s general Committee Meeting held on January 28, 1935. He was proposed by L. G. Callingham and seconded by H. D. Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; Duff continued to be a successful swordsman into the late 1930s. He also did well in business. The money he made allowed him to indulge his passion for horses. He became a competitive steeplechaser and show jumper. John Duff died in a riding accident in [[Epping Forest]] on January 8, 1958.

== Canadian connection ==
John Duff was born in China in 1895. Like everyone else in the [[British Empire]], Canadians were subjects of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff can be found on the [[Canadian Census]] for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for "Nationality". In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own [[passport]]s since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.

They are decorative [[deciduous]] trees that are used in the wood industry and for ornamental purposes.

==Etymology==
Both the scientific and common names refer to the sweet [[resin]]ous [[plant sap|sap]] (''liquid [[amber]]'') exuded by the trunk when cut.

== Species ==
* ''[[Liquidambar acalycina]]'' – Chang's sweetgum (central &amp; southern [[China]])
* †''[[Liquidambar changii]]'' - Miocene (Washington state, North America)
* ''[[Liquidambar formosana]]'' – Chinese sweetgum or Formosan sweetgum (central &amp; southern [[China]], southern [[Korea]], northern [[Thailand]],  [[Taiwan]], [[Laos]], northern [[Vietnam]]).
* ''[[Liquidambar orientalis]]'' – Oriental sweetgum or Turkish sweetgum (southwest [[Turkey]], [[Greece]]: [[Rhodes]]).
* ''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]'' – American sweetgum (eastern [[North America]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Texas]] and also eastern [[Mexico]] to [[Honduras]]).

==Description==
They are all large, [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|25|–|40|m}} tall, with [[leaf shape|palmate]]ly 3- to 7-lobed [[leaf|leaves]] arranged spirally on the stems and length of {{convert|12.5|to|20|cm}}, having a pleasant [[aroma]] when crushed. Their leaves can be many colors such as bright red, Orange and yellow.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite book | last =Peterson | first =Lee Allen | title =Edible Wild Plants | isbn =0-395-31870-X | publisher =Houghton Mifflin Company | year =1977 | location =Boston, Massachusetts | pages =214–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mature bark is grayish and vertically grooved.&lt;ref name=Peterson /&gt;  The [[flower]]s are small, produced in a dense globular [[inflorescence]] {{convert|1|–|2|cm}} diameter, pendulous on a {{convert|3|–|7|cm}} stem. The [[fruit]] is a woody multiple [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] {{convert|2|–|4|cm}} in diameter (popularly called a "gumball"), containing numerous [[seed]]s and covered in numerous prickly, woody armatures, possibly to attach to fur of animals. The woody biomass is classified as [[hardwood]].

[[File:Liquidambar styraciflua MHNT.BOT.2006.0.1265.jpg|thumb|right|''L. styraciflua'' [[inflorescence]]s on stem]]
In more northerly climates, sweetgum is among the last of trees to leaf out in the spring, and also among the last of trees to drop its leaves in the fall, turning multiple colors. Fall colors are most brilliant where autumn nights are chilly, but some cultivars color well in warm climates. Although a temperate species, at least one living Liquidambar tree survives in a hot and humid tropical city: [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].

==Distribution==
Species within this genus are widespread in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Turkey]], [[Rhodes]], [[North America]] and [[Mexico]] up to [[Honduras]]). In cultivation they can be seen in warm temperate and subtropical climates around the world.

==Fossil records==
[[File: Altingiaceae - Liquidambar species.JPG|thumb|right|Fossil leaf of ''Liquidambar'' from [[Pliocene]] of Italy]] 
This genus is known in the fossil record from the [[Cretaceous]] to the [[Quaternary]] (age range: 99.7 to 0.781 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/?a=taxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=54637 Fossilworks]&lt;/ref&gt; The genus was much more widespread in the [[Tertiary]], but has disappeared from [[Europe]] due to extensive [[glaciation]] in the north and the east-west oriented [[Alps]] and [[Pyrenees]], which have served as a blockade against southward migration. It has also disappeared from western [[North America]] due to climate change, and also from the unglaciated (but nowadays too cold) [[Russian Far East]]. There are several [[fossil]] species of ''Liquidambar'', showing its [[relict]] status today.

== Uses ==
The wood is used for furniture, interior finish, paper pulp, veneers and baskets of all kinds. The heartwood once was used in furniture, sometimes as imitation [[mahogany]] or [[Juglans regia|Circassian walnut]]. It is used widely today in flake and strand boards. Sweetgum is a foodplant for various [[Lepidoptera]] [[caterpillar]]s, such as the [[gypsy moth]].  The American sweetgum is widely planted as an ornamental, within its natural range and elsewhere.

The hardened sap, or gum resin, excreted from the wounds of the sweetgum, for example, the American sweetgum (''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]''), can be chewed on like chewing gum and has been long used for this purpose in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=Peterson /&gt; The sap was also believed to be a cure for [[sciatica]], weakness of nerves, etc.

In Chinese herbal medicine, ''lu lu tong'', or "all roads open," is the hard, spiky fruit of native sweetgum species. It first appeared in the medical literature in ''Omissions from the Materia Medica,'' by Chen Cangqi, in 720 AD.  Bitter in taste, aromatic, and neutral in temperature, ''lu lu tong'' is claimed to promote the movement of blood and [[qi]], water metabolism and urination, expels wind, and unblocks the channels.  It is an ingredient in formulas for epigastric distention or abdominal pain, anemia, irregular or scanty menstruation, low back or knee pain and stiffness, edema with difficult urination, or nasal congestion.{{sfn|Bensky|Clavey|Stöger|2004}}

The trees drop their hard, spiky seedpods in the fall by the hundreds, and these can become a serious nuisance on pavements and lawns.  Some cities have expedited permitting for removal of liquidambar trees.

'''''Love''''' is a 2011 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and scored by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Angels &amp; Airwaves]]. The film is the [[directorial debut]] of filmmaker [[William Eubank]]. The film's [[Premiere|world premiere]] took place on February&amp;nbsp;2, 2011 at the 26th Annual [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]] and the film was later featured in the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], [[Fantasia Festival|FanTasia 2011]], and a number of other festivals around the world. The film was screened in 460 theatres across the United States on August 10, 2011, in the [[Angels &amp; Airwaves Presents Love Live|Love Live]] event.&lt;ref name="mtv-event"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/07/15/angels-and-airwaves-love-live-event/ |title=MTV News &amp;#124; EXCLUSIVE: Angels &amp; Airwaves Present 3-For-1 Live Music And Film Experience |publisher=moviesblog.mtv.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love'' portrays the personal-[[Psychological trauma|psychological]] [[Social isolation|effects of isolation]] and [[loneliness]]  when an [[astronaut]] becomes stranded in space and through this, emphasizes the importance of [[Human interaction|human connection]] and [[love]]. Additionally, it touches on the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|fragility of humanity's existence]] (explored through a [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|dying Earth]]-[[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] [[Doomsday event|doomsday]] scenario) inspired by the cautions of [[Carl Sagan]] in ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'' and considers the importance of [[memory|memories]] and [[narrative|stories]] as humanity's legacy.&lt;ref name="sbiff"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Eubank |first=William |subjectlink=William Eubank |interviewer=SBIFF |title=Director Q&amp;A |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=2011-02-03 |work=Santa Barbara International Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During an 1864 battle of the [[American Civil War]], a lone [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier, Captain Lee Briggs (Bradley Horne), is dispatched on a mission to investigate a mysterious object reported to Union forces. He leaves to venture on the mission.

175 years later, in the year 2039, United States Astronaut Lee Miller ([[Gunner Wright]]) is sent to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) as a one-man [[skeleton crew]] to examine if it is safe for use and to perform necessary modifications after it had been abandoned two decades earlier for reasons unknown. Shortly after arriving on board, tumultuous events break out on Earth, eventually resulting in Miller losing contact with [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator|CAPCOM]] and finding himself stranded in orbit alone, forced to helplessly watch events on Earth from portholes 200 miles above his home planet. Miller struggles to maintain his sanity while in isolation by interacting with [[Instant film|Polaroid]] pictures of former ISS crew members left aboard the ship.

When the station has some power glitches, Miller journeys into an [[International Space Station#Unpressurised elements|unpressurised module of the space station]] to perform repairs and discovers the 1864 journal of Briggs. Miller reads Briggs's account of the war and becomes enthralled by the mysterious object he is searching for, not realizing he will soon become more familiar with the very same object, and not by accident.

In 2045, six years after losing contact with CAPCOM and with a failing [[oxygen]] system inside the ISS, Miller puts on a [[space suit]] and goes for a [[Extravehicular activity|spacewalk]], deciding that it would be easier for him to detach his [[tether]] and slowly drift towards Earth and to burn in the atmosphere than slowly suffocate to death on board the ISS. He finds, however, that he is unable to go through with his suicide.

Miller is seen still aboard the ISS, presumably much later: his hair has grown extremely long, and he is extensively tattooed. He has drawn sketches of people and battles of the Civil War from the journal all over the interior of the ISS. The cramped quarters of the space station have become a rat's nest symbolic of his diminished sanity. He then seems to be contacted from outside the ISS, and to receive instructions to dock and transfer over. He does so, and seems to arrive in a giant uninhabited structure of distinctly human making. It is unclear whether this is reality or imagined by Miller, who is now insane.

Miller wanders around until he happens upon a server [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] where he finds a book titled "'A Love Story' As Told by 'You'". Inside this book, he finds pictures of Captain Lee Briggs with his discovery, a gigantic cube-like alien object that may have helped advance Human society. In the index of the book, Miller finds a reference to himself and types it into the computer prompt. He then finds himself inside a generic hotel room, where a disembodied voice says:

{{quotation|How are you doing, Lee? Sorry about this projection, but it's the only way we could reach you. We can't tell you how relieved we are to have you here. Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, we have to tell you something. You're the last one, it's all gone. We understand how you might feel. Connection is perhaps the most cherished thing any being can have. That's the thing. That's why we've been listening. The place you see here is a scrapbook of sorts, a collection of memories and mementos of mankind's brief existence. It's a good thing we found you. We look forward to meeting you, Lee.}}

During the speech, we see the same cube-like object in space in the year 2045. The viewer is left to assume that this object has 'obtained' Lee Miller and is speaking directly to him. The film ends with the voice of a computer speaking of human connections and love.

===Limited release===
{{Main|Angels &amp; Airwaves Presents Love Live}}
''Love'' was shown nationwide {{clarify|date=December 2012}} on August 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fathomevents.com/concerts/event/angelsandairwaves.aspx{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DVD===
Angels &amp; Airwaves released a [[box set]] containing the film ''Love'', the soundtrack to the film, ''Love Part I'', and the band's fourth studio album ''Love Part II'' on November 8, 2011.

==Reception==
At the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the film was originally slotted three showings but two additional showings in the Arlington Theatre were added after some original showings sold-out.

Dennis Harvey, for [[Los Angeles]]-based magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote "[The film's] spiritual abstruseness and the script's myriad other ambiguities might infuriate in a film less ingeniously designed on more tangible fronts. But ''Love'' delights with the detail of its primary set as well as in accomplished effects, consistently interesting yet subservient soundtrack textures (the sole original song is reserved for the closing-credit crawl) and a brisk editorial pace…"&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944550/ |title=Film Reviews: Love |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dustin Hucks, for [[Ain't It Cool News]], wrote "''Love'' can at times get very broad with scenes, dialogue, and flow… if you're keen on clarity and the linear, ''Love'' is going to leave you frustrated. For others, however&amp;ndash;the challenge of understanding what is what may lead to a desire for repeat viewings, which for me – is a lot of fun… This is a film that's clearly not for everyone – but has a lot to offer the ''[[Inception]]'' and ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'' crowds."

Hucks continued to say ''Love'' was one of the most visually exciting low-budget films he'd seen in some time and concluded with an overall endorsement: "''Love'' is well worth seeking out in theaters – but don't miss it on DVD if you don't get the opportunity to view it in theaters."&lt;ref name="aicn-hucks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/48561 |title=Dustin falls in love with... well, LOVE! |publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercury-Atlas 10''' ('''MA-10''') was a cancelled early [[manned space mission]], which would have been the last flight in [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Mercury program]]. It was planned as a three-day extended mission, to launch in late 1963; the spacecraft, '''''Freedom 7-II''''', would have been flown by [[Alan Shepard]], a veteran of the suborbital [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] mission in 1961. However, it was cancelled after the success of the one-day [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] mission in May 1963, to allow NASA to focus its efforts on the more advanced two-man [[Gemini program]].

==Planning==

Scheduling for the MA-10 mission began as early as mid-1961, before a single orbital flight had been flown. It was planned as a one-day orbital mission, using Spacecraft #15 and Atlas booster 144D.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The - by now heavily modified  - spacecraft #15A was delivered to Cape Canaveral on 16 November 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; renumbered #15B in January 1963, and prepared for use as a backup spacecraft for [[Mercury-Atlas 9|MA-9]];&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; by this stage, NASA was noncomittal about whether or not a fifth orbital flight would be flown.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Mercury-Atlas 8]] flight in October 1962, some commentators speculated on the possibility of MA-10 being flown as a "dual mission". In this approach, MA-10 and a new MA-11 flight, the latter using the MA-10 backup capsule, would be launched in close proximity, and fly a loosely co-ordinated mission, similar to the Soviet [[Vostok 3]] and [[Vostok 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Now Has Capability for Twin Space Shot |journal=The Science News-Letter|date=October 20, 1962|volume=82|issue=16|page=254 | jstor = 3944968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in late 1962 the MA-10 mission had still been planned as a nominal one-day flight,&lt;ref&gt;''Mercury spacecraft no. 15A configuration specification'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as of early 1963, the tentative plan for the MA-10 mission anticipated it being around three days long.&lt;ref name="This new ocean, p. 492"&gt;''This new ocean'', p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was to be flown by Alan Shepard, the backup pilot for MA-9, then in preparation, and previously the pilot of the [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] suborbital mission in 1961. In a nod to his earlier spacecraft, Shepard named #15B "Freedom 7-II".&lt;ref name="40th"&gt;{{cite web
  |url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/shepard.htm
  |title=Alan B. Shepard, Jr. 
  |accessdate=2009-11-03
  |publisher=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103035606/https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/shepard.htm|archivedate=2004-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission would have carried a re-entry communications experiment, which involved injecting water into the plasma sheath surrounding the spacecraft on reentry, in the hope that it would disrupt the sheath enough to allow radio communications; this was later flown on [[Gemini 3]].&lt;ref&gt;''On the shoulders of titans'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

The backup astronaut for Shepard is unclear, but most likely would have been [[Gordon Cooper]], as he was the only other astronaut who had not left the program entirely by mid-1963 or had moved to Gemini.

==Cancellation==

By April, NASA had begun referring to MA-9 as the "culmination" of the program,&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; and on 11 May NASA declared publicly that it was "absolutely beyond question" that a successful MA-9 flight would mean no MA-10.&lt;ref name="This new ocean, p. 492"/&gt; During the MA-9 postflight press conference on 19 May, [[Robert C. Seamans]] was asked about the possibility of a fifth orbital flight, and described it as "quite unlikely". President Kennedy, when asked a similar question three days later, demurred, saying that the decision was one for NASA to make.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting on 6 and 7 June debated carrying on to the MA-10 flight - or possibly beyond. The main argument put forward was that it would gain usable information for the Gemini and Apollo missions without needing a great deal of investment; the spacecraft and launch vehicles were available and almost ready for flight.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, pp. 195-196&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure had come from a more directly involved constituency as well; both NASA officials and the President himself had been lobbied by the "[[Mercury Seven]]" astronauts for a seventh Mercury mission.&lt;ref name="This new ocean, p. 492"/&gt;

Work continued on modifying Spacecraft #15B until 8 June, but on 12 June, the NASA Administrator, [[James E. Webb]], stated publicly to the Senate Space Committee that there would be no further Mercury flights. All work ceased on the program, with personnel and resources reassigned to the [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1963, it was obvious that continuing Mercury would sap resources needed for Gemini and Apollo. Despite the ambitious experiments planned for later Mercury missions, they would have run up against the tight payload capacity limits of the capsule and Atlas vehicle. The consumables needed for a three-day Mercury flight alone would have added 100 pounds (136 kilograms) of additional weight. In addition, the large number of malfunctions that occurred on Faith 7's flight drove home the fact that Mercury's hardware wasn't robust enough to stand a day-long mission, let alone multi-day. NASA officials disliked the lengthy gap between manned missions that would result from this decision, and the first manned Gemini mission ended up taking place in March 1965, twenty-two months after the end of Mercury and an even longer amount of time than originally expected.

Four Atlas boosters and Mercury capsules were in a state of partial completion when Mercury was cancelled. Although there was talk of using the leftover Atlases to launch Agena target vehicles for Gemini, the program's funding was eventually increased enough that NASA could afford to buy brand-new Atlases using the newer SLV-3 core.

The capsule was placed in storage, then later displayed at the [[Ames Research Center]] in California; it is now on display at the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in Chantilly, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19680241000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The Michelangelo Hand's development was begun by the German prosthetics manufacturer Ottobock. In 2008, the American company Advanced Arm Dynamics became involved with testing and further refinement of the prosthesis.&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt;

The prosthesis is battery-powered and can be used for up to 20 hours between charges.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Constructed of metal and plastic, it is designed with a natural, [[anthropomorphic]] aesthetic, and can be custom-fitted for each user. Its motions are controlled by built-in [[electrode]]s, which detect the movements of the user's remaining arm muscles and interpret them using [[electromyography]] software.&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt; The fingers can form numerous naturalistic configurations to hold, grip or pinch objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/4718|title=Clinical Experiences With The Michelangelo Hand, A Four-Year Review|author=Miguelez, John M.|year=2011|publisher=[[Duke University]] Libraries|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Michelangelo Hand is capable of moving with enough precision to conduct delicate tasks such as cooking, [[ironing]] and opening a [[toothpaste]] tube,&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt; but can also exert enough strength to use an automobile's [[steering wheel]]. Skin-toned cosmetic gloves are also available for the prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hangerclinic.com/limb-loss/adult-upper-extremity/adv-tech/Pages/Michelangelo-Hand.aspx|title=Michelangelo Hand|publisher=Hanger Clinic|year=2014|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Michelangelo Hand had a unit cost of around £47,000 (US$73,800).&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Mosby Monroe Parsons]]. --&gt;'''Mosby Monroe Parsons''' (May 21, 1822 – August 15, 1865) was a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Missouri State Guard]] and the [[Confederate States Army]] who commanded [[infantry]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War]].&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Mosby Monroe Parsons]]. --&gt;

==Early life and career==
The eldest child of Gustavus Adolphus Parsons and his wife Patience Monroe Bishop, Mosby Monroe Parsons was born in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. When he was 13, his parents moved to [[Cole County, Missouri]]. Two years later, they moved again to [[Jefferson City]], which Parsons would thereafter make his home. As a young man, Mosby [[read law]] and was admitted to the bar in 1846. He served as a volunteer in the [[Mexican-American War]] with the rank of captain in Colonel [[Alexander W. Doniphan]]'s regiment and was cited for gallantry at the [[Battle of Sacramento]] on February 28, 1847. Returning to Missouri after the war, he married Mary Wells on September 18, 1850. However, his wife died just three years later, leaving him with an infant son, Stephen Kearney Parsons.

Parsons served as the United States [[District Attorney]] for western Missouri. In 1856 was elected to the state legislature.  He became a state senator in 1858, serving until the Civil War began in early 1861.

==American Civil War==
During the [[secession crisis]] in Missouri, Parsons was appointed brigadier general in command of the Sixth Division of the [[Missouri State Guard]].  He arrived too late to participate in the skirmish at [[Battle of Boonville|Boonville]], but he went on to lead his division at [[Battle of Carthage (1861)|Carthage]] and the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] in Missouri. Although his Missouri State Guardsmen participated in the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], Parsons was absent from this action seeking an appointment into the Confederate Army in Richmond, Virginia.

Parsons was commissioned a brigadier general of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] on November 5, 1862 and led his infantry brigade in the [[Battle of Prairie Grove]], Arkansas one month later.  His force would participate in the attack at [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], Arkansas on July 4, 1863, and assisted [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] in thwarting [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel Banks|Nathaniel Banks's]] [[Red River Campaign]] of 1864 in Louisiana (Battle of Pleasant Hill), as well as opposing Union Major General [[Frederick Steele]]'s [[Camden Expedition]] in Arkansas, including participation at the [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]].

Parsons was appointed a major general by Trans-Mississippi Departmental Commander [[Kirby Smith]] on April 30, 1864, although his promotion was never confirmed by [[Jefferson Davis]].

==Death==
After the war's end, Parsons, like many other Missouri Confederates, chose to go to [[Mexico]] rather than return to Missouri. He and three companions, including his brother-in-law, Capt. Austin M. Standish, Standish's orderly William "Dutch Bill" Wenderling
&lt;ref name="Chronicling"&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87052143/1886-01-30/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1865&amp;index=3&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Aaron+Conrow+H&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1922&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=aaron+H+Conrow&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Lexington Weekly Intelligencer January 30, 1886 accessed March 24, 2016 Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Confederate Congress]]man [[Aaron H. Conrow]] were attacked, captured, and executed by a band of regular Mexican cavalry near [[China, Mexico]] headed for [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas]] on August 15, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1684593 Gurley, Bill J.

Via [[Project Muse]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;  The bodies of Parsons and his comrades were either thrown into the San Juan River or buried in unmarked graves where they were killed.&lt;ref name="Chronicling"/&gt; In 1868, Parsons's son (Kearny Parsons) and sister (Mildred Standish), along with the family of Aaron Conrow, sued the Mexican government via the U.S. and Mexico Claims Commission Convention. In 1875, a judgment in the amount of almost $50,000.00 in gold was awarded to each of the plaintiffs.

'''Alice Poppy Madeleine Gross''' (14 February 2000 – {{Circa}} 28 August 2014) was an English girl who was murdered in London.

Gross suffered from [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], which was suggested by her mother and some mainstream media sources in the early days of the search for her as being related to her disappearance.&lt;ref name="Indy CCTV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article4197125.ece|title=Missing Alice has anorexia, police reveal|first=Gabriella|last=Swerling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in [[Hanwell]], west London, with her sister, Nina Gross,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29471094|title=Question Time apologises over Alice immigration debate|date=3 October 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and parents,&lt;ref name="Indy CCTV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alice-gross-police-release-cctv-footage-of-teenager-as-parents-appeal-for-her-safe-return-9713701.html|title=Alice Gross: Police release CCTV footage of teenager as parents appeal for her safe return|work=The Independent|accessdate=21 September 2014|date=5 September 2014|author=Natasha Culzac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss.

==Suspects==
Two men were arrested in connection with Gross's death; both were later released without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/16/alice-gross-police-missing-latvian|title=Alice Gross disappearance: police search for missing man|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 September 2014|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prime suspect]] was [[Latvians|Latvian]] builder and convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, who went missing from [[Ealing]], London, on 3 September.&lt;ref name="Sky 7/7"/&gt;

==Murder inquiry==
On 1 October, police launched a murder inquiry after Gross's body was found hidden under logs on the bed of the [[River Brent]] the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Body found in river is Alice Gross, police confirm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/01/body-found-river-alice-gross-police|accessdate=1 October 2014|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, police announced that they had found a badly decomposed body in dense woodland in [[Boston Manor Park]] during their search for Zalkalns, and that early indications suggested the body may be his.&lt;ref name="BBC Zalkalns"&gt;{{cite news|title=Body found in Alice Gross suspect search|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29492356|accessdate=4 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police confirmed two days later that the body was that of Zalkalns. The cause of his death was hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29515913|publisher=BBC|title=Alice Gross death: Body found is suspect Arnis Zalkalns|work=BBC News|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
The local community of Hanwell was galvanised during the time Gross was missing, and a poster campaign to “Find Alice” was organised through a [[Facebook]] page. In order to increase public awareness of Gross being missing the community tied yellow ribbons to trees, railings, their cars and homes. On 8 October Gross's family requested that the ribbons be removed while memorials were left at the Clock Tower in Hanwell. Ealing Borough Council flew flags at half-mast following the discovery of Gross's body, opened a public book of condolence and replanted flower beds near to the Hanwell Clock Tower with yellow pansies in Gross's memory.

==Police briefing==
In a briefing on 28 January 2015, the Metropolitan Police stated that "all the evidence points firmly to Arnis Zalkalns" and that he would have been charged if he had not hanged himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]], p.20, 28 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost inquest file==
On 26 July 2015, it was reported that a 30-page document relating to the case had been lost after West London coroner Chinyere Inyama left it on a train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33668112 |title=Alice Gross murder file lost in coroner error |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2015 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Caroline |last=Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/26/alice-gross-investigation-coroner-file-train-chinyere-inyama |title=Alice Gross: investigation launched after coroner leaves sensitive file on train |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 July 2015 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inyama subsequently was told to reassigned the case to another coroner, and it was taken by Dr Fiona Wilcox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Alice Gross coroner drops out of murder inquest after he leaves police file on train|last = Watts|first = Matt|date = 9 October 2015|work = London Evening Standard|access-date = |via = |page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9198">The '''Murder of Brian Glick''' involved [[homicide]] victim Brian Glick, who was murdered at the age of 21 on October 25, 1993, by Dennis Tate and Michael Olson in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], [[Minnesota]]. Glick's murder was a shock to the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] community, and his death and the subsequent court proceedings of his murderers received widespread attention in the Twin Cities press.

==Brian Glick's life==
Brian Glick was born on April 25, 1972, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. He grew up in [[Minneapolis]]. His parents were divorced in 1978. His family moved to Bloomington and in 1990 Glick graduated from [[Bloomington Kennedy High School]]. In 1992 he began working at a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] store on Old Shakopee Road East, a block away from where he lived with his mother, stepfather and teenage sister, Tammy. At the time of his death Glick had been working to save enough money to marry his fiancée Katie Long.&lt;ref name=Employee&gt;Neal Gendler. "Employee alone in store robbed, beaten to death in Bloomington." Star Tribune. 27 Oct, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Glick was interested in [[aviation]], but his plans to become an aircraft mechanic were thwarted when it was discovered that he was [[color-blind]]. Instead, Glick returned to school and completed the necessary course work to become a paramedic.&lt;ref name=Employee/&gt;

In the year before his death, it was discovered that Glick had a large [[benign]] [[brain tumor]], and in May 1992 he underwent surgery to have it removed.&lt;ref name= Wangstad&gt;Wayne Wangstad. "Clues Sought In Beating Of Bloomington Man." St. Paul Pioneer Press. 27 Oct. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death Glick was still recovering, but his prognosis was positive. However, the operation that saved his life contributed to his death. Shortly after surgery Glick returned to work at Subway. On the last day his boss saw him he commented "You're really bouncing around here tonight. You really look good." Glick responded that  he was feeling the best he had since the surgery and he was going to make it.&lt;ref name=Margaret&gt;Zack Margaret. "Man Gets 27 Years for Murdering Subway Employee."  Star Tribune 25 Mar. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder==
On the night of Monday October 25, 1993, Glick was working alone at the Subway shop. He spoke with his fiancée by telephone around 11 p.m., and fifteen minutes later, at around 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., went out back to empty the trash.&lt;ref name=Man&gt;"Man, 19, is indicted in Subway shop killing." Star Tribune. 25 Nov. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Glick was unaware that Dennis Tate (b. 04/27/1977), 16,&lt;ref name= Tatecr&gt;{{cite court |litigants= State of Minnesota vs Mujahid Ghazi Muhammad.

Olson was a former employee at the store, but had been fired, and knew both Glick and the layout of the store.&lt;ref name=Man/&gt; As Glick headed back into the shop after emptying the trash, Tate and Olson jumped him and brutally choked and beat him until he was unrecognizable.&lt;ref name= Sweeney&gt;Mike Sweeney. "Suspects Admit Sandwich Shop Slaying." St. Paul Pioneer Press. 30 Oct. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The two then entered the store, vandalized surveillance cameras, and stole a cashbox containing $152. 
Glick's fiancée went to the store about 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to pick him up. When she found the store empty she called police, who arrived shortly before midnight. Glick was found behind the store and immediately taken by ambulance to [[Hennepin County Medical Center]].&lt;ref name=Gendler&gt;Neal Gendler. "2 Juveniles Are Charged With Murder In Unrelated Stabbing, Beating Deaths." Star Tribune 02 Nov. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Glick died at 4:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. Tuesday, October 26, 1993, with his parents at his bedside. Doctors noted that a piece of skull that was healing from the recent brain tumor operation had been pushed up and back into his brain, contributing to Glick's death.&lt;ref name= Wangstad/&gt;

==The convictions and releases==
Michael Olson was arrested on October 27 after police found a bloody shirt at his home.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; Dennis Tate was apprehended the following day. The two confessed to killing Glick, and told the police that they had intended to double the money stolen with the purchase and sale of drugs - a plan that went awry when they were ripped off by a drug dealer.&lt;ref name=Sub&gt;Wayne Wangstad. "Sub shop slaying suspects wanted to double money." St. Paul Pioneer Press 29 Oct, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olson and Tate pleaded guilty in a [[Hennepin County Government Center|Hennepin County District Court]]. Olson's proceedings were overseen by Judge [[Kevin Burke, Judge|Kevin Burke]].&lt;ref name=Margaret/&gt;&lt;ref name= Tatecr/&gt;&lt;ref name= Olsoncr/&gt; Olson was sentenced in March 1994 to 27 years and two months in prison for [[second-degree murder]].&lt;ref name=Margaret/&gt;&lt;ref name= Olsoncr/&gt;   Glick's father, Stephen; mother; and fiancée provided victim statements at the proceedings. At Olson's [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] Glick's father said:	

{{quote|His [Olson's] prison is now measured by walls. Mine is measured in sadness, loneliness and anger. For the rest of my life, my relationship with my son has been dictated by him. I hate him for making this prison for me. I hate him for taking it upon himself to decide how I will relate to my son.&lt;ref name=Margaret/&gt;}}

Tate's proceedings took over a year because his defense argued he was not yet sixteen years old, even though a birth certificate showed he was born over sixteen years ago, and therefore he could not be tried as an adult. The motion was denied by the judge, but Tate's team appealed the conviction all the way to Minnesota Supreme Court, which denied Tate's petition. Tate was ordered to stand trial as an adult, but he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. In January 1995, Tate was sentenced to 25½ years in prison by Judge John M. Stanoch.&lt;ref name= Tatecr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;Jim Parsons. "Surprise speaker makes race issue - Murder victim's parents irate in court." Star Tribune 31 Jan. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  At Tate's sentencing, Minneapolis Imam Matthew Ramadan spoke on Tate's behalf and stated Tate's fate was "the same situation of so many other African-American males. I expect the courts to
judge him more harshly because he killed a white man. Justice is not blind." Glick's exasperated mother was quoted in the [[Star Tribune]] saying, "I'm the one who lost a son. Why did he [Ramadan] try to turn it into a racial thing?"&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;

While in prison, Tate changed his name to Mujahid Ghazi Muhammad. He was released from prison under supervised custody in a work release program in [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] in 2010.

'''Polly Hannah Klaas''' (January 3, 1981 – October 1, 1993) was an American murder victim whose case gained national attention. On October 1, 1993, at the age of twelve, she was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] at knife point during a [[slumber party]] from her mother's home in [[Petaluma, California]]. She was later strangled. [[Richard Allen Davis]] was convicted of her murder in 1996 and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/polly-smiling-killer-death-sentence-article-1.741066|title=Polly's Smiling Killer Gets Death Sentence|last=Kennedy|first=Helen|date=August 6, 1996|publisher=''The New York Daily News''|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On October 1, 1993, Polly Klaas and two friends were having a slumber party. Late in the evening, [[Richard Allen Davis]] entered their bedroom, carrying a knife. He tied both friends up, pulled pillowcases over their heads and told them to count to 1,000. He then kidnapped Klaas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollyklaas.org/about/pollys-story.html|title=Polly's Story|work=pollyklaas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two months, about 4,000 people helped search for Klaas.&lt;ref name="Mercury News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Kevin|title=City nearly demolishes Polly Klaas bench in Pacific Grove – The Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2011/09/15/city-nearly-demolishes-polly-klaas-bench-in-pacific-grove/|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=MediaNews, Monterey County Herald|publisher=The Mercury News|date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV shows such as ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' and ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' covered the kidnapping. An APB ([[all-points bulletin]]) with the suspect's information was broadcast within 30 minutes of the kidnapping. The broadcast, however, only went out over Sonoma County Sheriff's Channel 1.

In a rural area of Santa Rosa, about 20 miles north of Petaluma, a babysitter on her way home noted a suspicious vehicle stuck in a ditch on her employer's private driveway. She phoned the property owner, who decided to leave with her daughter. As she drove down the long driveway to Pythian Road, the owner passed Davis. She called 911 when she got to a service station and two deputies were dispatched on the call. The deputies did not know of the kidnapping or the suspect's description, due to Sonoma Valley units being on Channel 3. The deputies ran Davis' driver's license and license plate number, but they came back with no wants or warrants. The deputies tried to convince the property owner to perform a [[citizen's arrest]] for trespassing. Under California law, a citizen may make an arrest for this type of misdemeanor. The property owner would have had to go to the car with the deputies and say "I arrest you." The deputies then would have taken Davis into custody. The property owner refused.

The deputies called for a tow truck to get Davis' car out of the ditch. They searched it thoroughly before the arrival of the tow truck and did not find evidence of anyone else in the car. The only possible violation was an open container of beer, but Davis was not driving at the time of the deputies' contact and mere possession of an open container was not illegal. Before Davis was allowed to leave, he was instructed to pour out the beer and the deputies filled out an FI (Field Interrogation) card with his information and the FI card was filed.

On November 28, 1993, the property owner was inspecting her property after loggers had partially cleared the property of trees. She discovered items that made her think they might have matched those used in the kidnapping. She called the sheriff's department to report her discovery, and deputies and crime scene investigators were dispatched. One of the items found, a torn pair of ballet leggings, was matched by the FBI Crime Laboratory to the other part of the leggings that were taken as evidence on the night of the kidnapping. A review of calls in the area the day of the kidnapping turned up the contact with Davis, who had only been identified because both deputies had filled out and filed the FI card. Once the identity of Davis was revealed, his palm print at the scene of the kidnapping was also traced to him. Authorities had been unable to match the partial print earlier due to the poor quality of the print.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department, in cooperation with Petaluma Police and the FBI, launched a search of the property and the Pythian Road area during a heavy rainstorm. The first two days of the search were kept as low-key as possible, since Davis was under surveillance at an Indian rancheria near Ukiah, California. When nothing was found during the initial search and the surveillance of Davis also produced no results, the decision was made to arrest him for the kidnapping of Klaas.

While Davis was being interrogated by Petaluma PD and the FBI, a massive search was launched on Friday, December 3. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was assisted by over 500 search team members from 24 agencies, coming from as far away as Kern County, California and Washoe County, Nevada. The mutual aid effort was coordinated by the California State Office of Emergency Services (now known as the [[California Governor's Office of Emergency Services]]), FBI Crime Scene teams and numerous other state and federal agencies. The search remains today as one of the largest ever conducted in California. The search continued through Saturday, December 4. The search effort produced other items of evidence, but did not produce any evidence of human remains. The search was planned to continue on Sunday, December 5, but on the evening of December 4, Davis confessed to kidnapping and murdering Klaas and led investigators to her body.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Graphic Testimony in Klaas Trial Forces Family Out of Court|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-07/news/mn-1395_1_family-klaas-trial|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=Associated Press|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 1996|location=San Jose, CA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had buried her in a shallow grave just off Highway 101, about a mile south of the city limits of [[Cloverdale, California]]. The grave site is about 20 air miles and about 30 road miles from the search site.

Although Davis admitted to strangling Klaas to death, he refused to give investigators a timeline of the events from October 1. Investigators thought he was fearful that both people who passed him would call the sheriff's department. It is believed that he killed her before the arrival of deputies and hid her body in the thick brush on the hillside above where his car was stuck. He then waited for an undetermined period of time after being escorted back to Highway 12, about 1.5 miles from where his car was stuck and drove back up to retrieve her body. He was reportedly out of breath, sweating profusely (despite being a cool night) and had twigs and leaves in his hair when contacted by deputies. It is also believed that he had chosen the grave site in advance, since it would not have been discovered by a casual observer. The gravesite area would be directly visible from Highway 101, but not the grave itself. He had to drive from the Indian Rancheria in Ukiah once a week to meet with his parole officer and he would have seen any police activity in the area.

==Conviction==
After a long, tumultuous trial, Davis was convicted on June 18, 1996, of first-degree murder and four special circumstances (robbery, burglary, kidnapping and a lewd act on a child) in Klaas' death.&lt;ref name=townhall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/debrajsaunders/2009/03/12/richard_allen_davis_safe_on_death_row/page/full/|title=Richard Allen Davis: Safe on Death Row|work=townhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Superior Court jury returned a verdict of death. At his formal sentencing by a judge, Davis provoked national outrage by taunting his victim's family, extending both middle fingers at a courtroom camera&lt;ref name="south coast today"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locke|first1=Michelle|title=The Polly Klaas story unfolded through a veil of many tears|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/19960811/NEWS/308119990|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=Associated Press|publisher=southcoasttoday.com|date=August 11, 1996|location=SAN JOSE, Calif.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later saying that Klaas' last words just before he killed her were that her father molested her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/27/us/before-being-sentenced-to-die-killer-disrupts-a-courtroom.html|title=Before Being Sentenced to Die, Killer Disrupts a Courtroom|date=September 27, 1996|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 5, 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Thomas Hastings sentenced Davis to death by lethal injection&lt;ref name="NY Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Helen|title=POLLY'S SMILING KILLER GETS DEATH SENTENCE|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/polly-smiling-killer-death-sentence-article-1.741066|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=NY Daily News|date=August 6, 1996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked, "It is very easy for me to pronounce this sentence, given your revolting behavior in this courtroom".

Davis is currently on death row at [[San Quentin State Prison]], in Marin County, California. Having survived an apparent drug overdose while in prison and attacks on him by several other prisoners, Davis is now in solitary confinement and continues to assist his attorneys in various appeals, and has more appeals ahead of him before the sentence passed can be carried out.

==Winona Ryder==
Actress [[Winona Ryder]], who had been raised in Petaluma, offered a $200,000 reward for Klaas' safe return during the search. After her death, Ryder starred in a [[Little Women (1994 film)|film version]] of ''[[Little Women]]'' and dedicated it to her memory, because that had been her favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301373,00.html 'Women' on the Verge]; last accessed December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
Klaas' body was cremated and her ashes spread over the [[Pacific Ocean]] by her friends and family.

In the wake of the murder, Klaas' father, Marc Klaas, became a child advocate and established the [[Polly Klaas Foundation#KlaasKids Foundation|KlaasKids Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbko.com/tech/headlines/22214009.html |title=WBKO Talks With Child Advocate Marc Klaas About KlaasKids Foundation |last=Provenzano |first=Sam |date=June 27, 2008 |publisher=wbko.com |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006064801/http://www.wbko.com/tech/headlines/22214009.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made himself available to parents of kidnapped children and has appeared frequently on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[CNN Headline News]]'' and ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]''. He is also portrayed in ''[[The Elizabeth Smart Story]]'' by Barry Flatman, as meeting the Smarts and informing them he was working with [[Fox News]].

The all points bulletin was broadcast on the CHP ([[California Highway Patrol]]) channel, which only CHP radios could receive. CHP practice changed after the case. The radio system was upgraded and such bulletins are now broadcast on all police channels through a centralized 911 dispatch system.

Five years after Klaas' murder, a performing arts center was named in her honor in Petaluma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfchroniclemarketplace.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/10/01/NEWS556.dtl&amp;hw=petaluma&amp;sn=189&amp;sc=241|title=Performing arts center dedicated to Polly Klaas|date=October 1, 1998|publisher=sfchroniclemarketplace.com|accessdate=January 28, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207183808/http://sfchroniclemarketplace.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fe%2Fa%2F1998%2F10%2F01%2FNEWS556.dtl&amp;hw=petaluma&amp;sn=189&amp;sc=241|archivedate=February 7, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the murder, politicians in California and other U.S. states supported [[three strikes law]]s and California's Three Strikes act was signed into law on March 8, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=George|first1=Evan|title=Prop. 36 and how California's 'Three Strikes' law came to be|url=http://curious.kcrw.com/2012/10/3-strikes|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=For The Curious|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n9_v26/ai_15856830/ |title=The right three strikes – three strikes and out law |last1=Franklin |first1=Daniel |date=September 1994 |work=Washington Monthly |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noble Ape''' is an [[artificial life]] development project launched in June, 1996 by [[Tom Barbalet]]. It was designed to be a forum for a diversity of contributors to work towards a coherent [[cognitive]] [[simulation]] development environment.&lt;ref name="FIRST"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Noble Ape History
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/docs/acts.html
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Simulation==
The central software of the project is the [http://www.nobleape.com/sim/ Noble Ape Simulation], based on the ideas outlined in [http://www.nobleape.com/man/philosophic.html Noble Ape Philosophic]. There are two primary aims of the Simulation;
* to simulate the biological environment the Noble Apes inhabit, and,
* to simulate the Noble Apes' [[cognitive]] processes.&lt;ref name="SECOND"&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Tom
  | title = Noble Ape Simulation
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/sim/
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Noble Apes move around and react to external and internal events (weather, fear, panic, sleep, ...). Noble Ape integrates many concepts in the areas of [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name="THIRD"&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==
Noble Ape is available as [[open source software]], under the [http://www.nobleape.com/man/legal.html Noble Ape Open Source License], and is distributed with Apple Computer's [[Apple Developer Tools#CHUD Tools|CHUD Tools]], included with every new [[Apple Macintosh]] computer and is used by [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="FOURTH"&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Apple's CHUD Tools, Intel and Noble Ape

  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphics engine in the Noble Ape Simulation, codenamed Ocelot, is a non-[[polygonal]] engine, which allows smooth and quick rendering of land and water surfaces.&lt;ref name="SIXTH"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Graphics in the Noble Ape Simulation
  | url=http://www.nobleape.com/docs/sim_graph.html
  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Noble Ape Simulation also contains the [[programming language]], [[ApeScript]].&lt;ref name="SEVENTH"&gt;{{cite web

Noble Ape also features a [[podcast]], [http://www.nobleape.com/reality/ Ape Reality], where various aspects of the programming, biology, philosophy and meta-theory behind the development are discussed.&lt;ref name="EIGHT"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet

  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Noble Ape received a grant from the [[Australian Film Commission]] in 1998. Barbalet used this money to buy computer hardware and record an audio CD/CDROM, ''Isle of the Apes''. Having returned from the US at the end of 1998, Barbalet recorded the second CD/CDROM, ''Mind Monkeys and Purrfect Beats'' (sic). A collection of tracks from these CDs were released on the 2018 digital compilation ''Noble Ape: Project Music''. In mid-2018, Barbalet released the single ''June 13 (This is Noble Ape)'' to address some of the challenges the development has experienced over twenty two years.&lt;ref name="TENTH"&gt;{{cite web

  | title = This is Noble Ape (Youtube)
  | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJKgyfwONXI
  | accessdate = 2018-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video Project==

To celebrate twenty-two years of continuous development, Barbalet undertook an at-least a video per day [[vlog]] project documenting many different aspects of Noble Ape that had not been previously talked about. Barbalet noted that the reason to do this on [[YouTube]] and [[Instagram]] was to introduce a new audience to his work.&lt;ref name="ELEVENTH"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Barbalet
  | first = Tom
  | title = Tom Barbalet's YouTube Channel
  | url=https://www.youtube.com/barbalet/
  | accessdate = 2018-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-Projects==

Noble Ape provided the core of six different sub-projects that had been developed by Barbalet and others through the Noble Ape development history. These six sub-projects are actively maintained under the Noble Ape development.&lt;ref name="TWELTH"&gt;{{cite web

===Noble Warfare===

Noble Warfare was developed by Barbalet in [[Wilmslow]] in Cheshire. Inspired by [[Lindow Man]], Barbalet reflected on the impact unwritten wars had through history on a local population. He was also inspired by the [[Total War (series)]] of video games. Noble Warfare pits two armies defined through an [[ApeScript]]-like interface and shows how the resolution of the battles can be covered by many different probabilistic outcomes.

===Mushroom Boy===

The early development of the Mushroom Boy came from Barbalet's time in [[Canberra]], Australia. The simulation is based in a vast [[suburb]]-based landscape and uses a number of core technologies in Noble Ape to create the environment and the entities that wander through the suburban environment. The name comes from an urban terrorism simulation Barbalet initially developed with the sub-project.

===Planet Noble Ape===

Planet Noble Ape was initially developed by Barbalet in [[Sunnyvale]], California. It provides the Noble Ape Simulation as part of a planetary simulation.

===Ecosim===

Ecosim takes the ideas of the Noble Ape Simulation and creates an educational tool specifically developed to highlight concepts in biodiversity. It was developed by Barbalet in 1997-1998 based on correspondence with a high school science teacher in Australia who wanted to have a tool to teach biodiversity based on Barbalet's work with Noble Ape.

===Noble Ape Skeleton===

This sub-project comes from the work of Bob Mottram to create a [[skeleton]] and [[vascular]] simulation based on the Noble Ape Simulation. The sub-project is based on taking Mottram's work and re-integrating it with the ongoing development.

===Noble Insect===

Noble Insect came from Barbalet's time in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. It is based on taking an [[insect brain]] and simulating that interaction with ideas and concepts developed through Noble Ape.

She served in the [[United States Navy]] from [[History of the United States Navy|1945 to 1963]] and was loaned to Pakistan under the [[Security Assistance Program]] (SAP) on a four-year lease after the [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub administration]] successfully negotiated with the [[Kennedy administration]] for its procurement.&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Hiranandani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hiranandani|first1=G.

In 1968, ''Ghazi'' executed a [[Submarine#Submersion and trimming|submerged]] [[circumnavigation]] of Africa and [[Southern Europe|southern parts]] of Europe through the [[Indian Ocean]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] due to the [[Six-Day War|closure of the]] [[Suez Canal]] in order to be [[refit]]ted and [[Mid-life update|update]]d at [[Gölcük Naval Shipyard|Gölcük]], Turkey.

On 5 August 1965, the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|war]] broke out between [[India and Pakistan]] as a result of [[Operation Gibraltar|covert infiltration]] in [[Indian-held Kashmir|Indian Kashmir]], and ''Ghazi'', at that time, was under the command of then-[[Commander (naval)|Commander]] [[Karamat Rahman Niazi]], who would later ascend as a [[Four star admiral|four-star]] admiral in the Navy.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; Other officers who served in ''Ghazi'' were then-[[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Ahmed Tasnim]] (later promoted as [[Vice admiral|Vice-Admiral]]), [[Sub-lieutenant|Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Fasih Bokhari]], and [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] [[Zafar Muhammad Khan|Zafar Muhammad]] who would later command her, as a Commander, in 1971.&lt;ref name="Roli Books Private Limited"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cardozo|first1=Major General Ian|title=The Sinking of INS Khukri: Survivor's Stories|publisher=Roli Books Private Limited|isbn=9789351940999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvs_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT28&amp;lpg=PT28&amp;dq=Ahmed+Tasnim+ghazi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eyfxZuMVjh&amp;sig=RvIz3Hhh-AET1eNoAtqywBltHCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD45b04LPQAhVmilQKHQQVBokQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahmed%20Tasnim%20ghazi&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notable [[commanding officer]]s of ''Ghazi'' in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] included:

On 17 September 1965, ''Ghazi'' made a surface contact and identified [[Leopard-class frigate|INS ''Brahmaputra'']] and fired three [[World War II]]-origin Mark 14 torpedoes and increased depth to evade the counterattack.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; According to submarine [[War diary|war logs]], there were three distinct [[explosion]]s that were heard at about the time when the torpedoes should have impacted but ''Brahmaputra'' was not sunk neither it had been hit it since the warship did not released the depth charge nor it had detected the [[Homing missile|homing signal]].&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; No ships were sunk or damaged in the area and ''Ghazi'' safely reported back to base.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

Upon her return, she won ten war awards including two decorations of ''[[Sitara-e-Jurat]]'', one ''[[Tamgha-i-Jurat]]'', and the [[Pride of Performance|President's citations]] and six [[Imtiazi Sanad]]s while her commander, Cdr. K.R. Niazi was decorated with the Sitara-e-Jurat and [[chief petty officer]]s were decorated with the Tamgha-i-Jurat.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roli Books Private Limited"/&gt; It is not known what ''Ghazi''{{'}}s target was or what were the three mysterious explosions were since no inquiry report was ever submitted.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

After the war, an arms embargo was placed in 1965–66 on both India and Pakistan but was later waived by the United States that was strictly based on the [[Cash and carry (wholesale)|cash and carry]] method as ''Ghazi'' badly needing refitting.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; In 1967, the Navy applied to renew another four-year lease deal which was duly approved by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Government but her material state and equipment continued to deteriorate.{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Hiranandani"/&gt; The Navy then signed a deal with the [[Turkish Navy]] for a [[refit]] and [[mid-life update]] that was to be carried out at Gölcük in Turkey – the only facility to update the ''Tench''-class submarines.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

Because of the [[Six-Day War]] in [[Middle East]] which had closed the [[Suez Canal]] due to the [[Egyptian Navy]]'s [[Naval blockade|blockage]] in 1967, ''Ghazi'', under the command of Commander [[Ahmed Tasnim]], had to execute a submerged [[circumnavigation]] in 1968 from Africa to [[Western Europe]] which began from [[Karachi coast]] to [[Cape of Good Hope]], South Africa and then through the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and it ended at the east coast of the [[Sea of Marmara]] where the [[Gölcük Naval Shipyard]] is located.{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Hiranandani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com"/&gt; [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]] Admiral [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan|S.M.

During her submerged circumnavigation voyage, she briefly stopped at [[Mombasa]], Kenya for refueling and, in [[Maputo]], Mozambique before making a farewell visit at  [[Simon's Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com"/&gt; After passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]], she made another stopover at [[Luanda]], Angola for victualing and continued her journey towards Western Europe to stopover at [[Toulon]], France where she was greeted by the [[French Navy]].&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com"/&gt; Her final stopover was at [[İzmir]] in Turkey and submerged through the east coast of the Sea of Marmara to dock at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard which was the only facility to upgrade the ''Tench''-class based computers and other [[Electromechanical Engineering|electromechanical]] equipments.&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com"/&gt; It took her two months to complete her circumnavigation of Africa and Europe.&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com"/&gt;

The deal for refitting and [[Mid-life update|mid-life]] upgrading of her [[military computer]]s reportedly cost ~[[United States Dollar|$]]1.5 million ([[US$|$]]11.1 million in [[Fiscal year|2015–16]]).&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; The program started in March 1968 and completed in April 1970 and it is believed that the U.S-made ill-fitted World War II era Mk.14/[[Mark 10 torpedo|Mk.10]] [[naval mine]]s were bought "[[Corruption in Turkey|secretly]]" from Turkey.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

===Eastern Front of Indo-Pakistani war of 1971===
{{Main|Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971#Naval operations in the Eastern theatre|l1=Naval operations in the Eastern theatre}}

Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Yousaf Raza, ''Ghazi'' returned to [[Karachi coast]] after successfully completing the submerged circumnavigation of Africa which was taken in order to undergo a refitting program and mid-life updates of her military computers on 2 April 1970.{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Hiranandani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="defencejournal.com" /&gt;

In August 1971, the Indian Navy transferred INS ''Vikrant'', its aircraft carrier, to the [[Eastern Naval Command]] in [[Visakhapatnam]] that forced the Pakistan Navy to adjust its submarine operations.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; Before 1971, there were several proposals made to the Ayub administration to strengthen the naval defense of [[East Pakistan]] but none were made feasible and the Navy was in no position to mount a defence against an approaching Indian naval advances.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; After the [[Operation Jackpot|defection]] of officers and sailors of [[Bangladesh Navy|East-Pakistan Navy]] to India, the [[Pakistan Eastern Command|Eastern Command]] was under intense pressure to counter the insurgency and the advance of the Indian Army towards East Pakistan on three fronts.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; The [[Yahya Khan|Yahya administration]] insisted the Navy attempt to reinforce the naval defence of the East while the [[NHQ (Pakistan Navy)|Navy NHQ]] objected to the idea of deploying ''Ghazi'' in the total absence of a seaport, straying away from their original plan.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; Many senior commanders had felt that the deployment of ''Ghazi'' was highly dangerous and impossible to achieve by sending the obsolete submarine behind enemy lines but deployment came when it became apparent that the war was inevitable.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;

Prior to her deployment, ''Ghazi'' continued to experience equipment failures and reportedly had aging issues. Since it was the only submarine of the Pakistan Navy and had the range and capability to undertake operations in the distant waters controlled by India, ''Ghazi'' was pressed into operation to destroy or damage ''Vikrant''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"&gt;Till, Geoffrey (2004).

Retrieved 2010-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 1971, she quietly sailed {{convert|3,000|mi|km}} around the Indian peninsula from the [[Arabian Sea]] to the Bay of Bengal under the command of Zafar Muhammad who was commanding a submarine for the first time, with 10 officers and 82 sailors.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; ''Ghazi'' was on a two-fold mission: the primary goal was to [[Seek and destroy|locate and sink]] ''Vikrant'' and secondary was to mine India's eastern seaboard which was to be fulfilled irrespective of the accomplishment of the first.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

==Fate==

The mysterious sinking of ''Ghazi'' took place on 4&amp;nbsp;December 1971 during its hunt to find ''Vikrant'' and/or during the minelaying mission on the [[Visakhapatnam Port]], Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"/&gt; The true cause of the sinking is still unknown, and Indian and Pakistani sources have different views.

On 16 November, she was in contact with the Navy NHQ and Commander Khan charted the [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] that reported that she was {{convert|400|km|mi}} off [[Bombay]].{{rp|82}}&lt;ref name="Beacon Press, Zakaria"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zakaria|first1=Rafia|title=The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807080467|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7DaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November, she was off to [[Sri Lanka]] and entered in Bay of Bengal on 20 November 1971.{{rp|82}}&lt;ref name="Beacon Press, Zakaria"/&gt; Around this time, the [[Top Secret]] files were opened as instructed and the hunt for ''Vikrant'' began on 23 November and ''Ghazi'' was off to [[Madras]] where reportedly the Indian aircraft carrier was stationed but she was 10&amp;nbsp;days late and ''Vikrant'' was now actually somewhere near the [[Andaman Islands]].{{rp|82}}&lt;ref name="Beacon Press, Zakaria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Quest of Freedom: The War of 1971 – Personal Accounts by Soldiers from India and Bangladesh|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9789386141668|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0r2DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;dq=PNS+Ghazi+vikrant+island&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA2vPf97fQAhXGv1QKHQ4zAGMQuwUIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=PNS%20Ghazi%20vikrant%20island&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to detect her target, ''Ghazi''{{'}}s commanders became [[Delusional intuition|delusional]] from their hunt for ''Vikrant'' and turned back to Visakhapatnam to start laying mines off the harbour with a confidence that it will take its swipe at ''Vikrant'' or at least bottle up the Indian Navy's heavy units clustered in this major Indian naval base on the night of 2–3 December 1971."&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;

On 1 December 1971, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Nilakanta Krishnan]] briefed Captain Inder Singh, the commanding officer of {{INS|Rajput|1942|6}}, that a Pakistani submarine had been sighted off the Sri Lankan coast and was absolutely certain that the submarine would be somewhere around Madras or Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt; He made it clear that once ''Rajput'' had completed refueling, she must leave the harbor with all navigational aids switched off.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;

According to Indian claims, at 23:40 on 3 December 1971, taking on board a pilot, ''Rajput'' moved through the channel to the exit from Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;&lt;ref name="al" /&gt;

Exactly at midnight, shortly after passing the entrance buoy, the starboard lookout reported a breaker on the surface of the water right on the nose. According to the Indian Navy's claims, Captain Singh changed the course at full speed across the specified point and ordered to drop two depth charges, which was done.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt; The explosions were "stunning", and ''Rajput'' suffered a serious material concussion to its structure. However, visible results of this attack are not given.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt; ''Rajput'' for some time surveyed the area dumping bombs, no longer found any contact — either visual or acoustic. A few minutes later, the destroyer continued her way to the coast of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;&lt;ref name="al" /&gt;

===Intelligence and deception===
{{Main|Military deception}}
According to [[Directorate of Naval Intelligence (India)|Indian DNI]]'s director Rear-Admiral Mihir K. Roy, ''Ghazi''{{'}}s existence was revealed when a signal addressed to naval authorities in [[Chittagong]] was intercepted, requesting information on a lubrication oil only used by submarines and [[minesweeper]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;Mihir K. Roy (1995) War in the Indian Ocean, Spantech &amp; Lancer. {{ISBN|978-1-897829-11-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Navy intelligence tracked ''Ghazi'' with a codename issued as ''[[Kali Devi]]'',&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, Azam"/&gt; and the Indian Navy began to realize that the Pakistanis would inevitably be forced to send their submarine ''Ghazi'' to the Bay of Bengal, as the sole ship which could operate in these waters.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, Azam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Commander Azam|title=Maritime Awareness and Pakistan Navy|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/mar/maritime.htm|website=www.defencejournal.com|publisher=Defence Journal, Azam|accessdate=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235258/http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/mar/maritime.htm|archive-date=2016-03-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice Admiral [[Nilakanta Krishnan]] of the [[Eastern Naval Command]] had maintained that it was pretty clear that Pakistan would have deployed ''Ghazi'' in the Bay of Bengal and a part of its plan was an attempt to sink the Indian aircraft carrier ''Vikrant''.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; At the same time concerted action was taken to disseminate [[Misinformation effect|misinformation]] designed to mislead the enemy about the true location of the aircraft carrier, and to foster confidence that the carrier was stationed at Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="br"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE4-2/harry.html |title=Bharat Rakshak Monitor: Volume 4(2) September–October 2001 |publisher=Bharat-rakshak.com |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128104709/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE4-2/harry.html |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these activities were apparently successful in deceiving ''Ghazi'' when on 25 November 1971, the Navy NHQ [[Communication with submarines|communicated]] with ''Ghazi'' that stated: "INTEL INDICATES CARRIER IN PORT Visakhapatnam".&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanacwhf.ru/?no=4&amp;art=6 |title=Войны, история, факты.

==Aftermath==

On 26 November 1971, ''Ghazi'' was expected to communicate with the Navy NHQ to submit its mission report but did not communicate with its base.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shabbir|first1=Usman|title=Operations in the Bay of Bengal: The Loss of PNS/M Ghazi«  PakDef Military Consortium|url=http://pakdef.org/operations-in-the-bay-of-bengal/|website=pakdef.org|publisher=Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi|accessdate=22 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220073143/http://pakdef.org/operations-in-the-bay-of-bengal/|archivedate=20 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy NHQ repeatedly made frantic efforts to establish the communication and anxiety grew as days passed for her return to the base.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt; Before the [[Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971|naval hostilities]] broke out, commanding officers had started worrying about ''Ghazi''{{'}}s fate and had already began to agitate their minds but the Navy NHQ senior command had replied to their junior officers that several reasons could, however, be attributed to the failure of the submarine to communicate.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt;

On 9 December, the Indian Navy strangely issued a statement about the fate of ''Ghazi.'' The first indication of ''Ghazi''{{'}}s fate came when a message from the Indian NHQ, claiming sinking of ''Ghazi'' on the night of 3 December, was intercepted.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt; The Indian NHQ issued the statement a few hours before the loss of {{INS|Khukri|1958|6}}, and prior to launch of [[Operation Python|second missile attack]] on Karachi port.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt;

===Indian version===

After the [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|ceasefire]] in 1971, the [[Government of India]] undertook an investigation into the incident and immediately claimed that the submarine was sunk following the series of maneuvers by the Indian Navy.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt; A submarine rescue vessel, INS&amp;nbsp;''Karanj'' was sent to check the debris and India later built a "Victory Memorial" on the coast near where ''Ghazi'' was sunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizag.metromela.com/Victory+at+Sea,+a+war+memorial/article/3984|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420041733/http://vizag.metromela.com/Victory+at+Sea,+a+war+memorial/article/3984|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-20|title=Victory at Sea memorial at Vizag}}&lt;/ref&gt; India credits the [[HMS Rotherham (H09)|INS ''Rajput'']] for sinking ''Ghazi'' and her crew were honored with [[Awards and Decorations of the Indian Armed Forces|gallantry awards]] for this event, but the actual details of ''Ghazi''{{'}}s sinking soon began to emerge after the war.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

The claim of sinking ''Ghazi'' has been a center of controversy between the Indian authors, giving doubts in their theories of mysterious sinking of the submarine.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi"/&gt; With Commodore Ranjit Roy testifying that "very loud explosion effects were heard at the beach that came from underwater."&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi" /&gt; Commodore Roy also concluded that "...at that time, how the ''Ghazi'' was sunk remained unclear as it does today."&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi" /&gt;

Hiranandani]], gave exhaustive account of the sinking of ''Ghazi'' and quoted that the naval records and top naval officials who commanded operations on the eastern seafront as saying that INS&amp;nbsp;''Rajput'' was sent from Visakhapatnam to track down ''Ghazi''. The book also noted that the time of dropping of the charges, the explosion which was heard by the people of Visakhapatnam and that of a clock recovered from ''Ghazi'', matched.&lt;ref&gt;Vice-Admiral (Retd) G M Hiranandani, ''Transition to Triumph: Indian Navy 1965–1975''. {{ISBN|1-897829-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Admiral Hiranandani maintained that the submarine almost certainly suffered an internal explosion but its causes are debatable.&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt;

Admiral Roy of India states: "The theories propounded earlier by some who were unaware of the ''[[ruse de guerre]]'' (attempt to fool the enemy in wartime) leading to the sinking of the first submarine in the Indian Ocean gave rise to smirks from within our own (Indian) naval service for an operation which instead merited a ''[[Bravo Zulu]]'' (flag hoist for Well Done)".&lt;ref name="roy" /&gt;

Admiral [[S.M. Nanda|S. M. Nanda]], [[Chief of Naval Staff (India)|Chief of Naval Staff]] of the Indian Navy during the conflict, stated : "In narrow channels, ships, during an emergency or war, always throw depth charges around them to deter submarines. One of them probably hit the ''Ghazi''. The blow-up was there, but nobody knew what it was all about until the fisherman found the life jacket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jan/22inter.htm|title=The Rediff Interview/Admiral S M Nanda (retd)  'Does the US want war with India?'|last=Sengupta|first=Ramananda|date=22 January 2007|work=Interview|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=26 March 2010|location=India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025190541/http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jan/22inter.htm|archive-date=2010-10-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Indian Navy again sent its divers to overlook its investigation and the divers recovered some items including the [[War diary|war logs]], officials [[Backup validation|backup]] [[VHS|tapes]] from her computers, and mission files that were displaced in [[Eastern Naval Command]] of Indian Navy, but the divers who studied the wreckage confirmed that the submarine must have suffered an internal explosion which blew up its mines and torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020721/spectrum/main2.htm |title=Naval museums give glimpse of maritime history |author=Trilochan Singh Trewn |date=July 21, 2002 |publisher=The ''Tribune'' |accessdate=May 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061104/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020721/spectrum/main2.htm |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests an explosion of [[hydrogen gas]] which violently built up inside the submarine while its batteries were being charged underwater.&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt;

In 2010, [[Lieutenant-General]] [[JFR Jacob|J.F.R Jacob]] of [[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]]  mentioned in an article that "''Ghazi'' was destroyed in an accident in which [[Indian Navy]]  was not involved. There were many opinions from authors of the Indian side who also shared this skepticism of the Indian Navy’s official stance.&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, 2012 Mulki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, 2012 Mulki"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulki|first1=Muhammad Abid|title=Warriors of the waves|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/383024/warriors-of-the-waves/|accessdate=23 November 2016|work=The Express Tribune|agency=The Express Tribune|publisher=The Express Tribune, 2012 Mulki|date=27 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124024723/http://tribune.com.pk/story/383024/warriors-of-the-waves/|archive-date=2016-11-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, former Indian naval chief, Admiral [[Arun Prakash]] quoted in the national security conference that [''Ghazi''] had sunk under mysterious circumstances, "not by INS Rajput as originally claimed."&lt;ref name="News X"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghazi sank due to internal explosion: Ex-Navy Chief|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGztly-lEvg|accessdate=23 November 2016|agency=News X|publisher=News X|date=14 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618173007/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGztly-lEvg|archive-date=2016-06-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistani military oversights===
{{Main|High-test peroxide|Nickel–hydrogen battery|Endothermic process}}
[[File:Mark 14 torpedo side view and interior mechanisms, Torpedoes Mark 14 and 23 Types, OP 635, March 24 1945.jpg|thumb|The sideview of [[Mark 14 torpedo|Mk.14]] torpedoes deployed in ''Ghazi'']]
In 1972, the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]] (HRC) never carried out investigation into this incident despite its formation to assess the [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|military and political failures]] of the country in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011310/http://www.pppusa.org/Acrobat/Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only on 10 February 1972, when the incident was officially recognized by the [[Government of Pakistan]] and then-[[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar Bhutto]] met with the [[Grief|grieving]] families and loved ones of the officers and sailors who served in ''Ghazi'', and told them that they may have all perished due to this incident as many of the slain family members were [[Transfer of Population Under the Terms of Delhi Agreement|pushing for repatriation]] to the [[Government of Pakistan]] as they were keeping the hope alive that they may have survived and rescued by India.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi" /&gt;

The [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|Naval Intelligence]] conducted its own investigations and its military oversights stated that ''Ghazi'' sank, when the mines it was laying, were accidentally detonated.&lt;ref name="Navy ISPR Investigations"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Navy ISPR|title=Pakistan Navy Official Website|url=http://www.paknavy.gov.pk/submarine_Force.html|website=www.paknavy.gov.pk|publisher=Navy ISPR Investigations|accessdate=22 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123002402/http://www.paknavy.gov.pk/submarine_Force.html|archivedate=23 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani military oversights into this incident were not immediate instead, the Naval Intelligence took time to conclude its investigations that went on for several years.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; Over the decades, the military oversights were kept hidden and were not known to the public until [[:Category:1990s in Pakistan|1990s]] when the Navy made an announcement over the completion of its insights into this incident.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; Following this announcement, Pakistan addressed the problems connecting the [[Mechatronics|electromechanical]] failures, computer problems, and [[Mark 14 Torpedo|Mk.14]] torpedoes' "circular deep running" once launched from the firing ship.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

Pakistan never accepted the theory from Indian Navy but provided its alternative insights into this disaster based on the investigations on the [[Mark 14 torpedo#Problems|Mark 14]] torpedoes and other vintage military equipment installed in ''Ghazi''.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt; According to Pakistan Navy's investigation, there were two probable reasons connecting to this [[Mishappenings|mishappening]]:
* *''[[Magnetic pistol|Magnetic Exploder]]/[[Hydrogen explosion]]'': A [[USS Sargo (SS-188)|Sargo-type]] [[lead-acid battery]] may have over-produced the [[Hydrogen gas]] during the charging of submarine's batteries that may have led to the violent internal explosion.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, Azam" /&gt; 
* *''Detonation of a mine inside the submarine'': This was often cited by the Pakistan Navy as the World War II-era Mk.10/Mk.14 torpedoes may have deep "circular" run, failing to straighten its run once set on its prescribed [[Gyrocompass|gyro-angle setting]], and instead, to run in a large circle, thus returning to strike the firing ship.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy ISPR Investigations" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was visualized in telefilm, ''Ghazi Shaheed'' in 1998 during the climax of its script.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pakistan Navy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PNS Ghazi Shaheed – Last footage|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2m5wr4|website=Dailymotion|publisher=Pakistan Navy|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123211121/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2m5wr4|archive-date=2016-11-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another more plausible theory from foreign experts, also favored by Pakistan, is that the [[Explosion|explosive]] [[shock wave]]s from one of the depth charges set off the torpedoes and mines (some of which may have been armed for laying) stored aboard the submarine.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi" /&gt; The [[Naval Headquarters (Pakistan Navy)|Navy NHQ]] counter-argued: ''Ghazi'' itself may have inadvertently passed over the mines during the mine laying operations; patrolling Indian vessels or Indian depth charges might also have tripped the count mechanism of one or more mines.&lt;ref name="Usman Shabbir, loss of Ghazi" /&gt; Credibility is added to this story by the later discovery made by [[Indian Coast Guard]] divers in 2003, that the damaged parts of the submarine had been blown inside out.&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transition to triumph: history of the Indian Navy, 1965–1975 By G. M. Hiranandani&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|NI]]'s investigations also exposed the ill-considered deployment of ''Ghazi'' when it was indicated that there was no indication that ''Ghazi's'' crew had ever practiced with mines.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;

In 2006, Pakistan, citing their evidences, vehemently rejected India's claim of sinking ''Ghazi'' and termed the claims as "false and utterly absurd".&lt;ref name="Times of India, 2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer|title=India did not sink Ghazi: Pak commander – Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-did-not-sink-Ghazi-Pak-commander/articleshow/914230.cms|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=The Times of India|agency=Times of India|publisher=Times of India, 2006|date=24 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404180651/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-did-not-sink-Ghazi-Pak-commander/articleshow/914230.cms|archive-date=2017-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutral witnesses and assessments===

An independent testimony stems from an [[Egyptian Navy]] officer, who claimed that the Indian ships were docked at the Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref name=egyptianwitness&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Ken|title=PNS Ghazi|journal=Hooter Hilites|issue=December 2007|page=6|url=http://ussseaowl.com/PDFFolder/Newsletter12-2007.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091200/http://ussseaowl.com/PDFFolder/Newsletter12-2007.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many independent writers and investigators maintained ''Ghazi'' was sunk mysteriously not by two depth charges alone– ''Ghazi'' may have sunk either by the hydrogen explosion produced when the batteries were charging, or by the detonation of a mine, or either by the sea floor impact while trying to avoid the depth charge released by INS ''Rajput''.&lt;ref name="wwiiafterwwii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, Azam" /&gt;

In 2012, Pakistani [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] from ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' who were affiliated with the [[Express News (Pakistan)|Express News USA]] based in the [[Washington D.C.]] were able to get in touch with ''Diablo's''' retired and now-aged former US Navy crew members who were allowed to study the sonar pictures and sketches of the sunken vessel where they believed that: "an explosion in the Forward Torpedo Room (FTR) destroyed the Ghazi."&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, 2012 Mulki" /&gt; This view is also shared by Indian journalist Sandeep Unnithan, who specializes in military and strategic analysis.&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, 2012 Mulki" /&gt;

===Recovery of sunken vessel===

In 1972, both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] offered to raise the submarine to the surface at their own expense.&lt;ref name=roy /&gt; The Government of India, however, rejected these offers and allowed the submarine to sink further into the mud off the fairway [[buoy]] of Visakhapatnam.&lt;ref name=roy /&gt;

In 2003, Indian Navy [[MARCOS|divers]] recovered few items from the submarine and brought up six bloated bodies of Pakistani servicemen when they blasted their way into the submarine.&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt; All six servicemen were given military honorary burial by the Indian Navy. Items recovered were the back-up tapes of the radar computers, war logs, broken [[Porthole|windshield]], top secret files, as well as one of the bodies of a [[Petty officer|Petty Officer]] [[Mechanical Engineer]] (POME) who had a wheel spanner tightly grasped in his fist.&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt; Another sailor had in his pocket a [[Love letter|letter]] written in [[Urdu]] to his [[fiancée]].&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt;

In 2003, additional photos were released by the Indian Navy of the vessel.&lt;ref name="India Today, 2003" /&gt;

{{for|the 2002 [[Ricky Fanté]] album|Soul Surfers}}

A '''soul surfer''' (coined in the 1960s) is a [[surfing|surfer]] who surfs for the sheer pleasure of surfing. Although they may still enter in competitions, winning is not the soul surfer's main motive, since they scorn the commercialization of surfing. The term denotes a [[spirituality]] of surfing. As Brad Melekian put it in a 2005 article in ''[[Surfer (magazine)|Surfer]]'' magazine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
to pursue surfing not just as an athletic endeavor or as a sunny day diversion, but to try to glean whatever lessons you can from the practice. It means being aware of your surroundings, and respectful of the people and places that you interact with. It means being patient, mindful, kind, compassionate, understanding, active, thoughtful, faithful, hopeful, gracious, disciplined and...good.&lt;ref name="goofyfoot"&gt;Melekian, Brad. March 2005, "Is God a Goofyfoot?", ''Surfer'', 46/3, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The term originates from a 1963 surf instrumental of the same name.

==History==
The first published mention of the term was in the 1963 surf guitar instrumental "Soul Surfer", by the [[Southern California]] [[Surf music|surf guitarist]] Johnny Fortune. The song was intended to reference the then-current [[soul music]] genre. The term "soul surfing" gained popularity in the late '60s, with the phrase most used in the mid- and late-'70s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfline.com/community/whoknows/whoknows.cfm?id=1114 Surfline | Who the F&amp;*K Knows&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 theologian Tom Blake penned an article entitled "Voice of the Wave", which examined the religious elements of surfing. By the early 70s, curious surfers began to experiment with various Eastern philosophies, such as [[yoga]] and meditation.&lt;ref name="goofyfoot" /&gt;

The concept of the soul surfer was the main focus for the 1987 film ''[[North Shore (film)|North Shore]]'', where the lead character fails to win a major surf competition because someone cheated, yet, unfazed, shrugs his shoulders and remarks that “it doesn’t matter to a soul surfer”. This was also a concept expounded in the 1994 film ''[[The Endless Summer II]]'', a documentary which sees two talented surfers go around the world to emulate the original film, ''[[The Endless Summer]]''. More recently, the phrase was used as the title of a book about [[Bethany Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton B (2004) Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family and Fighting to Get Back on the Board Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; a young female surfer who continued to surf after her arm was bitten off by a [[tiger shark]]. The book was made into a 2011 feature film, also called ''[[Soul Surfer (film)|Soul Surfer]]''.

Soul surfing has been described as “the highest level, the pinnacle of surfing spirituality equivalent to [[Nirvana]], [[Satori]], and [[buddhahood|total enlightenment]], but is rarely attained. The Soul Surfer expresses himself through his unity with the breaking wave. He borrows the wave's spirit for a short while and uses his body and equipment to translate the [[essence]] of the wave's spirit into Art”.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mitchell The Seven Levels of Surfers http://www.crowmountain.net/Surfing/sevenlevels.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angels Package==
As a result of a [[cancer]] diagnosis in October 2006, Binau began to consider other ways that she could put her experience and energy to work to help families of seriously ill patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristensen |first=Pernille |date=16 April 2009 |title=Ny bog gør op med dødens tabu |trans-title=New Book Confronts Death Taboo |url=http://gentofte.lokalavisen.dk/ny-bog-goer-op-med-doedens-tabu-/20090416/artikler/91877727/1226 |language=Danish |newspaper=Villabyerne -en dal aflokalavisen.dk |location=Denmark |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had envisioned how "easy", simple and important it would be to create a "hands on tool" that hospital staff could distribute to terminally ill patients and their loved ones. That vision became a reality when she developed the Angels Package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nyheder |first= DN|date= 22 February 2013|title=Ny hjælpepakke skal sikre mere plads til patienter |trans-title= New Rescue Package|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2013/02/22/Ny_hj_lpepakke_skal_sikre_mere_plads_til_patienter/ |language=Danish |newspaper=World News Network (wn.com) |location=Denmark |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When this project began, Binau did not have a budget to work with; she spray painted the first angels in her garage in Florida, then brought the first prototypes with her in a suitcase to Denmark.{{citation needed|reason=|date=October 2014}} At this time, her father was dying and Binau arrived just in time to say goodbye. As the first recipient of an Angel Package, he was surrounded by angels and calming music from [[MusiCure]] when he died. This loss taught Binau some important lessons that she later described in the national Danish [[newspaper]] ''[[Søndagsavisen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nielsen |first=Thomas |date=21 June 2013 |title=Jeg hviskede, at han skulle give slip |trans-title=I whispered that he should let go |url=http://sondagsavisen.dk/2013/25/jeg-hviskede-at-han-skulle-give-slip.aspx |language=Danish |newspaper=[[Søndagsavisen]] |location=Denmark |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life lessons learned through this difficult time were integral to the development of Binau's short publication "Dignity in the final hours" (Vaerdighed I sidste stund).&lt;ref name=dignity&gt;{{cite book |last=Binau|first=Susan |date= |title=Dignity in the final hours (English edition)|url=http://susanbinau.com/media/dignitynewest.pdf |location=Denmark |publisher= |isbn= |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building awareness==
In the following years, Binau embraced a role as "the voice of the families and children", advocating and participating as much as possible in the media, and on national television&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Binau, Susan (interviewee)  |date= 6 June 2011 |title=Angel Kit |url=http://www.tv2lorry.dk/artikel/58960 |format=video |medium=video, television news interview |publisher= |location=Denmark |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DR (broadcaster)|radio]]&lt;ref name="taboo2"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Binau, Susan; Binau, Alan; Anderson, Grethe (interviewees) |year=2009 |title=Sygdommens og sorgens sprog Tro og eksistens |trans-title=The language of disease &amp; sorrow.

After facing serious illness in their own relationship and understanding that sharing their own experience may help other couples with the difficult challenges encountered during the illness of a partner, Binau and her husband Alan Binau co-authored the book ''Till Sickness Do Us Part - How Love Survives in Difficult Times'', published by [[:da:Gads Forlag|Gads Forlag]].&lt;ref name="till sickness" /&gt;&lt;ref name="till sickness2"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 September 2009 |title=Parforholdet skranter, når den ene bliver syg |trans-title= Relationships can suffer when a spouse becomes ill |url=http://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/livsstil/familieliv/ECE790948/parforholdet-skranter-naar-den-ene-bliver-syg/|language=Danish |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |location= Denmark |accessdate= 26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the difficult topics of illness, death and dying in her books&lt;ref name="till sickness" /&gt; was a way to create awareness of harmful cultural [[taboo]]s.&lt;ref name="taboo2" /&gt; Sharing her own experiences and the experiences of her family opened much needed community and international dialog on this topic, ultimately leading to speaking engagements throughout Denmark and beyond. Through these engagements, Binau speaks to patients, patient families, and healthcare professionals to provide motivation, inspiration, and guidance.

==Cancer survivor and entrepreneur==
During chemotherapy Binau co-founded the company Vfactor A/S with Charlotte Alexandra Pedersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jobindex.dk/cms/stor_lykke_at_vaagne_om_morgenen_charlotte_alexandra_pedersen|title= Stor lykke at vågne om morgenen - Charlotte Alexandra Pedersen|author=Blankholm, Ulle Oppermann |date=2013-03-01 |website=www.jobindex.dk |publisher=JobIndex A/S |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was something that Binau and Pederson had planned and discussed for a long time, and they persisted in this work and vision despite the challenges presented by Binau's chemotherapy treatments and recovery from surgery.&lt;ref name="Richter" /&gt;

Binau is credited with developing new educational concepts including "Value Academy" and "Charter Academy", and building a strong mentor network of CEOs of some of the most prominent Danish companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bucchave |first=Gerd |date=14 January 2009 |title=Første lederuddannelse for kvinder |trans-title=The First Leadership Training For Women |url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/karriere/artikel/1/148855/foerste_lederuddannelse_for_kvinder.html  |language=Danish |newspaper=Borsen.dk  |location=Denmark|accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first couple of years, the client-base and vast network of Vfactor A/S had grown to include some of Denmark's largest corporations including AP Møller [[Mærsk]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 2009 Binau made the decision to fully focus on being an advocate for families dealing with terminal illness.{{citation needed|reason=|date=October 2014}} In an article written by Amy Patt, Binau emphasized how important it is to share experiences with like-minded people (patients, families, and friends) in order to avoid loneliness and isolation.&lt;ref name="Patt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Patt |first=Amy |date=20 August 2013 |title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH SUSAN BINAU, FOUNDER, ANGEL CARE FAMILY FOUNDATION |url=http://www.cbpmag.com/exclusive-interview-with-susan-binau-founder-angel-care-family-foundation/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823222508/http://www.cbpmag.com/exclusive-interview-with-susan-binau-founder-angel-care-family-foundation/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2013 |newspaper=CBP International Magazine |location= |accessdate=27 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was the driving motivator behind Binau's success in founding charities on two continents while working with minimal financial resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypresswire.com/dk/pressroom/20741/pressrelease/49531 |title=Døden er det sidste tabu [Death is the last taboo] |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 19 May 2011|website= |publisher=Angel Kit Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, Binau founded USA-based AngelKIT Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.angelkit.org/ |title=AngelKIT main page |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115082835/http://www.angelkit.org/ |archivedate=15 January 2012 |accessdate=11 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Binau founded and managed another charity, the Female Courage Foundation.&lt;ref name="Richter" /&gt;

==Kids helping kids==
In 2013, Binau's nine-year-old son Andy (Anders) handed her a book called ''Max the Super Dog's Pet Shop Adventures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramlow |first=Lars Sandager |date=20 October 2014 |title=Ni-årig bag bog til børn der mister |trans-title= 9 -year-old Anders writes book to help other children|url=http://hoersholm.lokalavisen.dk/9-aarige-anders-skriver-bog-for-at-hjaelpe-andre-boern-/Lokale-nyheder/20141029/artikler/710299879/1039 |language=Danish |newspaper=Ugebladet - en del af lakalavisen.dk |location=Denmark |accessdate=30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy said that he wanted to give his mother a helping hand: "My mother had created a book about cancer for the adults in the hospitals. So I thought that there was a lack of a book for children, who must lose one they care about, and then I started to do it."&lt;ref name="nov2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Restrup |first=Anne Katrine |date=8 November 2014 |title=Jeg syntes, at der manglede en bog til børnene om kræft |trans-title=I thought that there was a lack of a book for children about cancer |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/familieliv/2014-11-08/%E2%80%9Djeg-syntes-der-manglede-en-bog-til-b%C3%B8rnene-om-kr%C3%A6ft%E2%80%9D  |language=Danish |newspaper=[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]  |location=Copenhagen, Denmark|accessdate=10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This booklet, about a 'superpup', was created as an activity book to be given as a gift for hospitalized children. It later became an important part of a donation program, the AngelKID Heart Package (HJERTEPAKKE package),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stfa.dk/hjertepakken-til-born/ |title=Hjertepakke-donation til børn |trans-title=AngelKID Heart Package Donation for Children |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 June 2014 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children who have a [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] relative.

The AngelKID package program was launched through the Danish Charity founded by Binau, Landsforeningen Støtte Før Afskeden (National Association for Support Before Parting).&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stfa.dk/|title=Landsforeningen Støtte Før Afskeden |trans-title=National Association for Support Before Parting |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was publicized during a national bus campaign and on national television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Susan Binau |year=2014 |title=Go morgen Danmark: En sakaldt hjertepakke skau nu hjaelpe born med doende foraeldre |trans-title=Good Morning Denmark: Heart Packages are helping children of dying parents |medium=video |language=Danish |url=http://play.tv2.dk/programmer/nyheder-debat/magasiner/go-morgen-danmark/17-juni-2014-1-84367/ |accessdate=11 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708210422/http://play.tv2.dk/programmer/nyheder-debat/magasiner/go-morgen-danmark/17-juni-2014-2-84368/ |archivedate=8 July 2014 |format=video |time= |location=Denmark |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Ambassador Cecilie Lind (age 25) and her sister Fiona (age 9),  sisters who lost their mother in 2012 after a short battle with [[cancer]]. The book ''Max the Super Dog's Adventures'' and Heart Package Donations were further publicized by Susan and Andy Binau during a fall 2014 campaign in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timm |first=Mortem |date=29 October 2014 |title=9-årige Anders skriver bog for at hjælpe andre børn |trans-title=9 -year-old Anders writes book to help other children |url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/karriere/artikel/1/148855/foerste_lederuddannelse_for_kvinder.html  |language=Danish |newspaper=Borsen.dk  |location=Denmark|accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart Packages (Hjertepakken, Danish) have been donated to over 1000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stfa.dk/juni-2014-stfa-uddeler-1000-hjertepakker/ |title=Juni 2014: STFA uddeler 1000 Hjertepakker |trans-title= June 2014: STFA donates 1000 Heart Packages |last=Hasen |first=Kamilla Thirstrup |date=19 June 2014 |location=Denmark |language= Danish |accessdate= 25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Living Cosmos: Our Search for Life in the Universe''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by the [[astronomer]] [[Chris Impey]] that discusses the subject of [[astrobiology]] and efforts to discover life beyond [[Earth]]. It was published as a hardcover by [[Random House]] in 2007 and as a paperback by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2011.

==Summary==
The Living Cosmos is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[University of Arizona]] professor of [[astronomy]] [[Chris Impey]] on the status of [[astrobiology]]. It summarizes the state of research as scientists trying to address one of the most profound questions we can ask about nature: Is there [[life in the universe]] beyond the Earth? The author interviewed dozens of leading researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item5600535/?site_locale=en_US|title=Talking About Life|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he includes material from the interviews and vignettes of the researchers in the book. The companion web site to the book contains articles and video clips on astrobiology produced by the author, as well as a glossary and links to other relevant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelivingcosmos.com|title=The Living Cosmos|author=Hardegree-Ullman, K. K.|author2=Impey, C. D.|last-author-amp=yes|date=2011|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with a review of the cosmic setting for life and reviews the insights of astronomy since [[Copernicus]]. The discovery that we live in a “biological universe” would be a continuation of the progression where there is nothing exceptional about the setting of the Earth and the events that have occurred on this planet.

Subsequent chapters consider the [[origin of life on Earth]], and the physical extremes to which life as adapted. In [[astrobiology]], it pays to think “outside the box” and imagine how strange life might be or whether post-[[biological evolution]] is possible, where the basis is mechanical or computational. A chapter on evolution shows how it is affected by the cosmic environment.
 
Possibilities of life in the [[Solar System]] are considered next, with emphasis on [[Mars]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and outer [[moons]] harboring [[liquid water]]. Next is a summary of the rapidly changing state of play in the search for [[extrasolar planets]] or exoplanets. After centuries of speculation and decades of futile searching, planets around other stars were first discovered in 1995 and the number is now over 850, with several thousand more candidates from the [[Kepler mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoplanet.eu/|title=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia (Check here for an updated catalog of exoplanets)|author=Jean Schneider|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]) and the use of the [[Drake equation]] to frame discussions of cosmic companionship.

The web site for the book features images of a set of seven mixed media, boxed construction art pieces by Heather Green, commissioned specially for the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio5.org/about/experience-bio5|title=Experience BIO5|publisher=[[Arizona Board of Regents]]|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art is on permanent display in the BIO5 Institute at the University of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartagrafia.com|title=cartagrafia - projects|author=Heather Green|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on the collaboration between Heather Green and Chris Impey and the artistic and scientific themes of the work was published in the [[Leonardo Journal]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo.info/isast/journal/toc435.html|title=Leonardo Journal|issue=5|volume=43|author=Ellen K. Levy|date=2010|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Living Cosmos was generally very well received. It received a starred review from [[Kirkus Reviews]], referring to the book as a “Lively, clear, and up-to-date overview of [[astronomy]], [[cosmology]], [[biology]], and [[evolution]], specifically as related to the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chris-impey/the-living-cosmos/|title=The Living Cosmos by Chris Impey, Kirkus|author=Kirkus Review|date=2010|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular magazine [[Entertainment Weekly]] gave the book a grade of B+, saying it was “not an easy read” but calling it a “live, elegant overview”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20163350,00.html|title=The Living Cosmos Review|author=Wook Kim|date=2007|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Physics Today]]'', and ''[[New Scientist]]'', with the latter commenting on occasional digressions, but declaring the book “beautifully written”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626353.300-review-ithe-living-cosmos-by-chris-impey.html|title=Review: The Living Cosmos by Chris Impey|author=Lewis Dartnell|date=2007|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reader reviews are 85% five stars on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and over 90% like the book on [[Goodreads]]. The 2011 paperback edition has updates to help keep up with the accelerating pace of [[exoplanet]] discovery.

Maynard Smith and Szathmáry identified several properties common to the transitions:
# Smaller entities have often come about together to form larger entities. e.g. [[Chromosome]]s, [[eukaryote]]s, sex multicellular colonies.
# Smaller entities often become differentiated as part of a larger entity. e.g. [[DNA]] &amp; [[protein]], [[organelle]]s, [[anisogamy]], tissues, [[Eusociality|caste]]s
# The smaller entities are often unable to replicate in the absence of the larger entity. e.g. DNA, chromosomes, Organelles, tissues, castes
# The smaller entities can sometimes disrupt the development of the larger entity, e.g. [[Meiotic drive]] (selfish non-Mendelian genes), [[parthenogenesis]], [[cancer]]s, coup d’état
# New ways of transmitting information have arisen.e.g. DNA-protein, cell heredity, [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]], [[universal grammar]].

[[File:Памятник на могиле Неизвестного солдата Москва 0010 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Moscow]]]]
The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' refers to a monument dedicated to the services of an unknown soldier and to the common memories of all soldiers killed in any war. Such tombs can be found in many nations and are usually high-profile [[national monument]]s. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following [[World War I]], a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single [[tomb]], containing the body of one such unidentified soldier. It is a tomb for unknown people.

== History ==
=== France and the United Kingdom ===
During the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]), the Reverend [[David Railton]] had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the [[British Army]] as a [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], which bore the pencil-written legend "An Unknown British Soldier".&lt;ref name="Memorial"&gt;Henry Allingham, Dennis Goodwin (2011). "Kitchener's Last Volunteer:
The Life of Henry Allingham, the Oldest Surviving Veteran of the Great War". p. 132. Random House, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an "Unknown Warrior", proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the [[Dean of Westminster]], Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and later from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], responding to a wave of public support.&lt;ref name="Memorial" /&gt; At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of [[Le Souvenir français]] proposed the idea of burying "an ignored soldier" in the [[Panthéon]]. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law on September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Jean-Yves Le Naour, ''Le soldat inconnu : la guerre, la mort, la mémoire'', Gallimard, 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their 'monumental' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on [[Armistice Day]] 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Warrior]] was created at [[Westminster Abbey]], while in France ''[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (France)|La tombe du soldat inconnu]]'' was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.

=== Other countries ===
The idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the [[United States]] unveiled its own [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Arlington)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], Portugal its [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Portugal)|Túmulo do Soldado Desconhecido]], and Italy its [[Altare della Patria#Unknown soldier|La tomba del Milite Ignoto]]. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.

In Chile and Ukraine, second 'unknown tombs' were unveiled to commemorate ''The Unknown Sailor''.

== Symbolism ==
The Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a dead soldier who is unidentified (or "known but to God" as the stone is sometimes inscribed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kwon |first=Heonik |title=Ghosts of War in Vietnam |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-88061-0 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remains are considered impossible to be identified, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country's unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.

== Examples ==
Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:

[[Fidan Doğan]], [[Sakine Cansiz|Sakine Cansız]] and [[Leyla Söylemez|Leyla Şaylemez]], Kurdish women activists, were murdered by gunshots to the head during the night from 9 to 10 January 2013 in [[Paris]] (10th arrondissement).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/01/11/les-trois-militantes-kurdes-executees-a-paris-de-plusieurs-balles-dans-la-tete_1815662_3224.html] [[Le monde]] 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
During the night between Wednesday 9 and Thursday 10 January 2013, the bodies of Fidan Doğan, Sakine Cansız, co-founder of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) and Leyla Şaylemez – all three Kurdish women activists – were found in the premises of the Centre d'Information sur le Kurdistan located on 147 rue La Fayette in Paris. Each of them was shot execution-style with several bullets in the head.&lt;ref name="lemonde"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avec [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|title=Les trois militantes kurdes ont été assassinées de plusieurs balles dans la tête|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/01/11/les-trois-militantes-kurdes-executees-a-paris-de-plusieurs-balles-dans-la-tete_1815662_3224.html|date=11 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==
According to investigations by French authorities, it is possible that [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|MİT]] (Turkey's National Intelligence Organization) is involved in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/07/23/assassinat-de-militantes-kurdes-a-paris-la-justice-pointe-l-implication-des-services-secrets-turcs_4694801_1653578.html|title=Assassinat de militantes kurdes à Paris : la justice souligne l’implication des services secrets turcs|date=23 July 2015|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspected murderer, Ömer Güney, was a 34 year old Turkish maintenance employee at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle]] airport. Video cameras at the site of the murder show that he was inside the building between 00:11 and 00:56 when the deaths occurred. Gunpowder was found on his bag. Technical investigations were performed on his Nokia mobile phone and experts decrypted it and restored deleted files. They found images taken the day before (January 8) establishing that he was in the premises of a Kurdish association in Villers-le-Bel between 4:23 and 5:33 in the morning and took pictures of 329 memberships files. Two days before, he took pictures of accounting tracing alleged racketeering activity inside the Kurdish community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/kurdes-assassinees-la-piste-politique_1312649.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after these murders, an audio recording between Ömer Güney and some members of MiT, and some notes were anonymously released on the Internet. Omer Güney also had hundreds of pictures of Kurdish activists in his mobile phone. Antiterrorist judge Jeanne Duyé was in charge of investigations; in September 2013, her computer was stolen from her home in a burglary. Ömer Güney was in jail from January 21, 2013.

The judge considered the involvement of Turkish secret services in the murder to be a possibility, but didn't establish who ordered the operation and if the murderer acted according to the will of the top management or not (in theory, this may have been an attempt to stall peace talks that were occurring between Ankara and the PKK at that time). On December 13, 2016, Ömer Güney was moved to a hospital for urgent care connected to his brain tumor and he died the next day, five weeks before the scheduled start of his trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1982627-20161217-omer-gney-assassin-presume-trois-militantes-kurdes-paris-meurt-avant-proces « Omer Güney, assassin présumé de trois militantes kurdes à Paris, meurt avant son procès »], ''20minutes.fr'', accessed date 17 december 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/militantes-kurdes-assassinees-a-paris-le-suspect-renvoye-devant-les-assises-13-08-2015-5008789.php],[[le parisien]] 13 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fidan Doğan.png|thumb|Fidan Doğan in [[Strasbourg]] in 2012]]

Eyüp Doru, a representative of Turkish party [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]] in Europe, stated that he suspects Fidan Doğan was the main target{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} of the assassination. Lawyer Sylvie Boitel explained that this young woman was very clever and had three cultures: French, Turkish and Kurdish; one of her friends explained that she met French President [[François Hollande]] at least three times when he was leader of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and had active relationships with French authorities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Metin, the brother of Sakine Cansiz, says that France is responsible because she was killed in France and the murderer died in jail before trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.fr/story/133979/guerre-de-lombre], [[Slate (magazine)|slate.fr]], on 11 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

"Triple Assassinat au 147, Rue Lafayette" is a book by Laure Marchand, who spent three years investigating the murders and links with the Turkish secret services. It outlines the biographies of the three young women and discusses the politics of Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Retour-sur-l-assassinat-de-trois-militantes-kurdes-a-Paris-1172876 parismatch.com//Retour-sur-l-assassinat-de-trois-militantes-kurdes-a-Paris-]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a vivid blue pigment, and is the better known of the two extant species.  The species has been assessed as [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

== Biological characteristics ==
[[Image:Latimeria chalumnae embryo.jpg|thumb|left|''Latimeria chalumnae'' embryo with its yolk sac from the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]].]] 
The average weight of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' is 80 [[Kilogram|kg]] (176&amp;nbsp;lb), and they can reach up to 2&amp;nbsp;m (6.5&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. Adult females are slightly larger than males. ''L. chalumnae'' is widely but very sparsely distributed around the rim of the western [[Indian Ocean]], from South Africa northward along the east African coast to Kenya, the Comoros and Madagascar, seemingly occurring in small colonies.

==Population and conservation==
''L. chalumnae'' is listed as [[critically endangered]] by [[IUCN]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In accordance with the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species]] treaty, the coelacanth was added to Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in 1989. The treaty forbids international trade for commercial purposes and regulates all trade, including sending specimens to museums, through a system of permits. In 1998, the total population of the West Indian Ocean coelacanth was estimated to have been 500 or fewer, a number that would threaten the survival of the species.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;Jewett, Susan L., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/horizon/nov98/fishstory.htm "On the Trail of the Coelacanth, a Living Fossil"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1998-11-11, Retrieved on 2007-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First find in South Africa==
[[Image:Latimeria Chalumnae - Coelacanth - NHMW.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Preserved specimen of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' in the [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Natural History Museum]], Vienna, Austria (length: 170 cm - weight: 60 kg). This specimen was caught on 18 October 1974, next to Salimani/Selimani (Grand Comoro, Comoro Islands) {{coord|11|48|40.7|S|43|16|3.3|E}}.]]

On December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, the captain of the [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] ''Nerine'', returned to the harbour at [[East London, South Africa]], after a trawl between the [[Chalumna River|Chalumna]] and Ncera Rivers. As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]], curator at [[East London Museum]], to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he had set aside for her. Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen went to great lengths to avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum.  Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen but by the time the ''Nerine'' entered East London harbour many hours later the fish had become dark grey.

Failing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor [[J. L. B. Smith]], but he was away for Christmas.  Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]].  When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a coelacanth, known only from fossils. Smith named the fish ''Latimeria chalumnae'' in honor of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer and the waters in which it was found.  The two discoverers received immediate recognition, and the fish became known as a "[[living fossil]]". The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the [[East London, South Africa]], museum.

However, as the specimen had been stuffed, the [[gill]]s and [[skeleton]] were not available for examination, and some doubt therefore remained as to whether it was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that would take more than a decade.

==The second specimen, ''Malania anjouanae''==
A second specimen with a missing dorsal fin and deformed tail fin was captured in 1952 off the coast of Anjouan. At the time it was believed to be a new species and placed in a new genus as well, ''Malania'', named in honour of the [[Prime Minister of South Africa]] at the time, [[Daniel François Malan]], without whose help the specimen would not have been preserved with its muscles and internal organs more or less intact.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Samantha. 2006. A Fish Caught in Time: the Search for the Coelacanth, pages 63-82. HarperCollins Publishers, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
The [[genome]] of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' was sequenced in 2013 to provide insight into tetrapod evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The African coelacanth genome provides insight into tetrapod evolution  |vauthors=Amemiya CT, Alfoldi J, Lee AP, etal |journal=Nature |volume=496 |pages=311–316 |doi=10.1038/nature12027 |pmid=23598338 |issue=7445 |pmc=3633110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full sequence and annotation of the entry is available on the [[Ensembl]] genome browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensembl.org/Latimeria_chalumnae/Info/Index|title=Ensembl genome browser 78: Latimeria chalumnae - Description|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1974, '''''Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present''''' was French historian [[Philippe Ariès]]’ first major publication on the subject of [[death]]. Ariès was well known for his work as a [[medievalist]] and a historian of the [[family]], but the history of death was the subject of his work in his last decade of scholarly life. Ariès wrote several major books and articles on death [[History of mentalities|mentalities]] and is credited with introducing death as a topic for historical inquiry. ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'' began as a series of lectures presented to [[Johns Hopkins University]], which he gave for the express purpose of translation and publication. Because Ariès saw America as influential in changing the way the western world viewed death, he felt it was important to have his ideas circulating on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Ariès, ''Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974), x.&lt;/ref&gt; Covering over a millennia of history, Ariès divided ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'' into four separate periods, which make up the four major sections of the book: Tamed Death, One’s Own Death, Thy Death, and Forbidden Death.

==Tamed Death==

In his first chapter, he discusses the first period,   "Tamed Death", using a number of ancient texts and medieval [[Romance novel|romances]]. He argues that prior to the seventeenth century, people were acutely aware of their own imminent death, prepared for it, and accepted it. True to his roots as a medieval historian, he cites examples such as of [[King Ban]], [[Tristan]], and [[Lancelot]]—these characters are shown facing death while knowing that 'their time has come' and prepare themselves by following prescribed rituals. These rituals were often religious such as Lancelot positioning the body to be facing Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The dying man readied his body and soul for death and waited.

There were four general characteristics: first, the dying person would usually be lying in bed, or at least in a recumbent position. In the [[Christian]] tradition the dying person would lie on his or her back, facing the heavens. Second, the dying person in this period always presided over his death and understood its accompanying religious rituals and protocol. The priest was not brought until he was called for, and loved ones did not say goodbye until the dying person consented. Third, death was a public ceremony and parents, spouses, family, neighbors and even children were present at the bedside. Death was seen as [[Norm (sociology)|normal]] and it was customary for loved ones to witness the occasion. Finally,  while accepted and witnessed, it lacked "theatrics" and a "great show of emotions".&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès explains his choice of "Tamed Death" as a title is meant to contrast with the "wild" death of the twentieth century, in which people fear and avoid death.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this early medieval period people were not concerned with what would happen to their bodies after death. For superstitious reasons they did not want the dead to be buried in cities or near the houses of the living, but if the body was buried in a [[churchyard]] and remained under the church's protection, little else mattered. People did not believe that the grave should be permanent (especially the graves of the poor) and [[ossuaries]] were very common.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the burial grounds were common meeting places where dancing, gambling, and even commerce took place.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==One's Own Death==

Subtle changes in western people’s attitudes toward death occurred around the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Ariès titled this mentality shift: "One's Own Death". The defining feature of this era was a new [[personalization]] of death, in which the [[individual]] rather than the act of death itself came to the forefront. Ariès notes four major indicators that signify this change.

He explains that in the previous era, the Christian tradition of [[Last Judgment]] separated believers and non-believers after death. Christians alleged that during the [[second coming]] of Christ believers would be resurrected in [[Paradise]], while non-believers would cease to exist. However, by the twelfth century Ariès observes that Last Judgment had taken on new meaning. It came to signify judgment passed on one's [[soul]] after the moment of death. In the new Christian tradition, people believed that after death their good and bad deeds would be weighed against each other, and based on those deeds they would be either dammed or admitted immediately into heaven.  This made death more personal and individual.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès notes that the actual moment of death began to gain greater significance, as Christians believed that a person's [[Deathbed confession|deathbed]] behavior and personal reflection on their own deeds, at the moment of death, could influence heavenly judgment. As in the previous era friends and family were often present, but their presence became more closely tied to witnessing the moment before judgment rather than simply witnessing death.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in this era, depictions of [[corpses]] and [[skeletons]] became more prevalent, and individual [[tombs]] with inscriptions grew in popularity.  Although religious artwork had featured [[macabre]] themes in the past, by the seventeenth century there was an influx of artwork that featured decaying cadavers and the physical body after death. Ariès argues that this artwork was meant to warn against moral corruption and also express love of life. He states that men of that era felt a "love of life which we today can scarcely understand", due to our increased longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès also notes that by the thirteenth century individual tombs with inscriptions were becoming more typical, especially for the religious elite and royalty. Although during the [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman]] period individual graves had not been uncommon, this practice had faded during the [[middle ages]]. By the eighteenth century,   the middle and lower classes were also likely to have tombs, or at least plaques, marked with individual inscriptions. As people became more conscious of their individual place in the world, their death reflected that awareness &lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thy Death==

By the early eighteenth century, Ariès observed an abrupt change in the western person’s attitude toward death. Death was dramatized, exalted, feared, and in some cases worshipped.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking to themes in artwork from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, Ariès argues that death became categorically similar to sex, and was seen as a break from the ordinary. Although the erotic associations with death did not last beyond that short period, he maintains that death was no longer normalized. People did not look at death as a familiar occasion that was part of life, as they had in the past. Although people continued to participate socially and ritualistically in death, and crowds still flocked to the bedside of a dying person, their purpose had changed. Instead of witnessing death, they [[Mourning|mourned]] it.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[mourning]] was not completely new in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Ariès argues that it became unregulated. It was less of a ritualized social obligation, and more of a spontaneous and often excessive display of [[emotions]]. Ariès maintains that survivors no long accepted the death of friends and loved ones. He states that people of this period lamented that death was such a complete rupture from life and were consoled by preserving the [[memory]] of the deceased. Memorializing the dead became an important feature of the period of "thy death".&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a renewed interest in [[burial]] grounds and [[grave marker]]s. In the past Christians had been content to relinquish bodies to the care of the [[Catholic Church|church]]. Even when gravestones became more prevalent, Ariès argues that they were predominantly an expression of individuality or representative of individual donations to the church. However, by the eighteenth century, bodies were buried away from the church in individual [[cemetery]] plots, where people felt they could commiserate with the dead and cultivate their memory.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 70–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès also observes that while all western people celebrated cemeteries and their new role in society, France, Italy, and Germany are known for more elaborate tombs and burial sites when compared to the simplistic style of North America, the UK, and Northwestern Europe. He suggests that this trend is due to economic inequalities; poorer nations were more inclined to build elaborate tombs as a statement against the elegant simplicity that wealthier nations promoted.  Ariès also notes that because the countries that favored more ornate tombs were also [[Catholic]], it later became indicative of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forbidden Death==

The final period Ariès demarcates in the evolution of western attitudes toward death is the era of "forbidden death". Beginning in the very late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ariès argues that a "brutal revolution" occurred in western attitudes toward death, in which death became both shameful and forbidden. While this trend began in the United States – spreading to England, Northwestern Europe, and eventually the whole of the continent – the bulk of his analysis in this section deals primarily with England and Europe. Growing out of the [[sentimentality|sentimental]] era of "thy death" in which survivors mourned the death of loved ones openly, spontaneously, and with heightened displays of emotion, it soon became common practice to shield the people actually dying from the reality of their condition. The mourner, so moved by the gravity of death, wished to spare their dying loved one any emotional turmoil. Thus in the era of "forbidden death" the dying man no longer presided over his own death. Soon the extreme emotions that survivors expressed in the previous period were replaced with an equally extreme avoidance of death and suppression of emotion that became dominant in twentieth century. Ariès names two societal trends that he believes were very influential on shifting attitudes toward death: the advent of the [[hospital]] as a place of dying, and a growing sentiment that life should be, above all, [[Happiness|happy]].

Citing trends in [[literature]], such as the work of [[Tolstoy]], Ariès argues that the feeling surrounding death changed before its actual rituals did. By 1930–1950, he states that the displacement of the site of death from the home to the hospital accelerated changes in attitude. While for most of history the dying person took his or her last breath in bed, surrounded by loved ones, now, in era of "forbidden death" people are more likely to end their lives alone on a hospital bed.&lt;ref name="Aries"&gt;Ariès, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès writes that death is in the hospital is often a "technical cession" that is predetermined by a hospital team, frequently occurring after the dying person has already lost [[consciousness]]. He argues that the moment of death is difficult to distinguish for most survivors because they have already witnessed many "silent deaths" as the dying person loses different abilities – from [[Mechanical ventilation|breathing]] and [[Feeding tube|eating]] on their own, to [[Speech|verbal]] communication and eventually consciousness. He states that in this current period there is no great and dramatic act of death, which was what family, friends, and neighbors used to gather together to witness. Ariès writes: "No one any longer has the strength or patience to wait over a period of weeks for a moment which has lost its meaning."&lt;ref name="Aries" /&gt; Instead, doctors battle against death and when death finally comes it is usually considered a failure of medicine rather than a normal occurrence.

Ariès second observation regarding social changes over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was that happiness became the expected dominant emotion. He states that people began to believe "life is always happy or should always seem so."&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Death, being sorrowful and ugly, was therefore denied. Expressing [[sadness]] or emotional turmoil, Ariès argues, is likely to be equated with bad manners, mental instability, and unnecessary morbidity. Referencing anthropologist [[Geoffrey Gorer]], Ariès states that death has replaced [[sex]] as western society's greatest [[taboo]]. Children are less likely to be shielded from the notion of sex in the modern era, but they are not taught about death. When death occurs a child is told the deceased are "resting" and every effort is made to distract them from the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès also argues that the prevalence of [[cremation]] in England and parts of Europe reflects the western world's denial of death. He states that the act of cremation, with its usual lack of formality, associated rituals, and permanent location for remains is the ultimate expression of "forbidden death".&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ariès states that many of the recent trends regarding death originated in the United States, he argues that Americans have a unique death culture that is an amalgamation of the two extreme periods "thy death" and "forbidden death". He maintains that Americans do deny death as a part of life, and they are equally likely to die alone in a hospital, but once death actually occurs Americans have rituals that are all their own. [[Embalming]] became common practice in America by the early to mid-twentieth century, and American funerals are distinguished by the "[[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]" or viewing of the deceased. Ariès maintains that both practices are far less frequent in the rest of the western world. He argues that the embalmed body is not seen as fully dead and Americans believe they can communicate their last words and goodbyes to the deceased at this moment. [[Funeral directors]], he states, market themselves as "doctors of grief" who can see people through the period of mourning and return them to normalcy after the rituals of death (funeral, wake, burial/cremation) are complete. In this way, Ariès argues, death is sold like any other [[consumer good]]. Ariès concludes by stating that the current consensus toward death is that while we are vaguely aware of it, "at heart we feel we are nonmortals".&lt;ref&gt;Ariès, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and influence==

Ariès' ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'' has been applauded in both the field of [[history]] and the wider world of [[academia]]. Initial reviews celebrated this work as eye-opening, thought-provoking, and the first of its kind. Historian [[David Stannard]], writing for the ''American Historical Review'' noted the book was similar in structure, style and "panoramic vision" to Ariès' earlier works in the history of childhood. Like his earlier works, scholars predicted that Ariès would again ignite a new subfield in history.&lt;ref&gt;David Stannard, review of ''Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present'', by Philippe Ariès, ''The American Historical Review'' 80, no. 5 (1975): 1297.&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer stated that prior to Ariès’ study of death, scholars almost universally projected their own fear of death onto the historical record, believing revulsion toward death was a static mainstay of western history.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Mathe, review of ''Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present'', by Philippe Ariès, ''Social Science and Medicine'' 10, no. 5 (1976): 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer congratulated Ariès for his masterful application of the “history of mentalities,” to a shockingly overlooked subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Mazlish]], review of ''Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present'', by Philippe Ariès, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 5, no. 4 (1975): 751.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not everyone agreed with the Ariès’ exact methods and conclusions, reviewers acknowledged the history of death as deserving of further study. Philipe Ariès published frequently on the subject for the remainder of his career, including a revision of ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'', titled ''The Hour of Our Death'', which further separated the period he called “One’s Own Death,” into two separate categories: “The Death of Self,” and “Remote and Imminent Death.” This was done to take into consideration certain economic disparities in the period as well as the impact of the Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Ariès, ''The Hour of Our Death'', New York: Knopf, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariès works on the history of death are now considered seminal and current historians of death rely heavily on his frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, “Classics Revisited: The Hour of Philippe Ariès,” ''Mortality'' 4, no. 1 (1999): 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ariès is credited with opening the history of death up to further inquiry, many critics found that his short book spanning over a millennia of subject matter treated the subject too lightly, leaving more questions than answers.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of overgeneralization on a number of counts. Reviewers critiqued his broad treatment of large geographic areas, not accounting for any cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Mazlish"&gt;Mazlish, 752.&lt;/ref&gt; One critic found that Ariès did not adequately differentiate between rich, poor, rural, and urban groups, and also that he relied to heavily on literature, which can sometimes distort reality.&lt;ref name="Mazlish" /&gt; Historians of science and medicine felt their discipline had been overlooked and that changes in medical practice impacted death more than Ariès implied. [[Roy Porter]] noted that while Ariès was critical of hospital death, calling it cruel and impersonal, in the nineteenth century many people felt that dying in the care of a doctor was a “[[good death]],” and doctors were heralded for their ability to ease patients’ pain in their final hour.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Porter, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Porter argues that the way people die is very much dependant on the [[disease]] they are suffering from, and it is difficult to make comparisons and generalize a single mode of death. Finally, although Ariès periodization of western attitudes toward death was one of his biggest contributions, many critics questioned the periods he established, finding them “vague” or unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;Mazlish, 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'', Ariès, even by his critics has been hailed “the [[doyen]] of the historians of death.”&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; As predicted by early reviewers, Ariès’ work has helped present death as a subject for serious historical inquiry. Generations of historians have since examined attitudes toward death from many vantage points – [[cultural]], [[racial]], socio-economic – providing sharper explanations for attitude shifts in various geographic locations and time periods. The notion of “Forbidden Death” has received particular attention from scholars and critiques of the American funeral industry were popular in the 1960s and 70s. [[Jessica Mitford]]’s ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' exposed high profit margins for funeral directors and the large manufacturers that supply the material necessities related to burial (caskets, grave markers, etc.) &lt;ref&gt;Jessica Mitford, ''The American Way of Death'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Ivan Illich]], a well-known critic of modern medicine, devoted a chapter in his famed work ''Medical Nemesis'' to the horrors of hospital death. This chapter, he states “leans heavily on the masterful essays by Philippe Ariès."&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich, ''Limits to Medicine, Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health'' (New York: Marion Boyars, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Although many historians have commented on Ariès’ depiction of hospital death, few have commented on Ariès’ notion that the modern age is oppressed by its obsession with happiness. Historian Gary Laderman agreed that death has become a “forbidden” subject in recent years, but challenged Ariès, stating: “perhaps the experience of two world wars, particularly the mass destruction of the holocaust in Europe and the dropping of the atomic bomb in Japan, contributed to this reticence to discuss the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Laderman, ''The Sacred Remains: American Attitudes Toward Death, 1799-1883'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

American historians, in the years that followed the publication of Western Attitudes Toward Death, became particularly interested in the deviation Ariès noted between Americans and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;David Charles Sloane, ''The Last Great Necessity: Cemeteries in American History'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991),  173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Stannard]], an early reviewer of Ariès’ work, penned ''The [[Puritan]] Way of Death'' a few short years after Ariès' publication. He maintained that American religious practices strongly influenced their attitudes toward death. While he hoped to clarify some of the comments Ariès made about changes in American attitudes, he applauded Ariès [[Social influence|seminal]] work as both “profound and insightful.” Although ''Western Attitudes Toward Death'' has been heavily critiqued, historians of death have venerated it as a [[classic]] and foundational work on the subject.

{{About|Taoist religion||Xian (disambiguation)}}
{{Taoism}}
'''Xian''' ({{Zh|c=仙/仚/僊|p=''xiān''|w=''hsien''}}) is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable in English as:
*"spiritually immortal; transcendent; super-human; celestial being" (in [[Daoist]] philosophy and cosmology)
*"physically immortal; immortal person; immortalist; saint" (in Daoist religion and pantheon)
*"alchemist; one who seeks the [[elixir of life]]; one who practices longevity techniques" or by extension "(alchemical, dietary, [[qigong]]) methods for attaining [[immortality]]" (in [[Alchemy#Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemy]])
*"wizard; magician; shaman" (in [[Chinese mythology]])
*  "genie; elf, fairy; nymph" (in popular [[Chinese literature]], 仙境 xian jing is "fairyland", [[faery]])
*"sage living high in the mountains; mountain-man; hermit; recluse" ([[folk etymology]] for the character 仙)
*"immortal (talent); accomplished person; celestial (beauty); marvelous; extraordinary" (metaphorical modifier)
''Xian'' semantically developed from meaning spiritual "immortality; enlightenment", to physical "immortality; longevity" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and [[tai chi]], and eventually to legendary and figurative "immortality".

The ''xian'' archetype is described by [[Victor H. Mair]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as ''ṛṣi'' who possessed similar traits.1994:376 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the [[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]], Chinese ''xian'' (仙) can mean Sanskrit ''ṛṣi'' (''[[rishi]]'' "inspired sage in the [[Vedas]]").

==The word ''xian''==
[[Image:Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.2|"The [[Eight Immortals]] Crossing the Sea"&lt;ref name =werner&gt;{{cite book | first=E. T. C. | last=Werner|authorlink=E. T. C. Werner| year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }} ([[Project Gutenberg]] eText 15250)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most famous Chinese [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''xiān'' is ''Bāxiān'' (八仙 "the [[Eight Immortals]]"). Other common words include ''xiānrén'' (仙人 [[sennin]] in Japanese, "immortal person; transcendent", see ''[[Xianren Cave|Xiānrén Dòng]]''), ''xiānrénzhăng'' (仙人掌 "immortal's palm; [[cactus]]"), ''xiānnǚ'' (仙女 "immortal woman; female celestial; angel"), and ''shénxiān'' (神仙 "gods and immortals; divine immortal"). Besides humans, ''xiān'' can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological [[Huli jing|''húlijīng'']] 狐狸精 (lit. "fox spirit") "fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress" has an alternate name of ''húxiān'' 狐仙 (lit. "fox immortal").

The [[etymology]] of ''xiān'' remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE ''[[Shiming]]'', a [[Chinese dictionary]] that provided word-pun "etymologies",  defines ''xiān'' (仙) as "to get old and not die," and explains it as someone who ''qiān'' (遷 "moves into") the mountains."

[[Edward H. Schafer]] (1966:204) defined ''xian'' as "transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)" Schafer noted ''xian'' was cognate to ''xian'' 䙴 "soar up", ''qian'' 遷 "remove", and ''xianxian'' 僊僊 "a flapping dance movement"; and compared Chinese ''yuren'' 羽人 "feathered man; ''xian''" with English [[peri]] "a fairy or supernatural being in [[Persian mythology]]" ([[Persian language|Persian]] [[wikt:ری#Persian|pari]] from ''par'' "feather; wing").

Two linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of ''xian'' involve [[Arabic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. Wu and Davis (1935:224) suggested the source was ''[[jinn]]'', or ''jinni'' "genie" (from Arabic ''جني'' ''jinnī''). "The marvelous powers of the ''Hsien'' are so like those of the ''jinni'' of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, ''jinn'', may not be derived from the Chinese ''Hsien''." Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary (2007:527) suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between ''xiān'' (Old Chinese *''san'' or *''sen'') "'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air" and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''gšen'' &lt; ''g-syen'' "shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air".

==The character and its variants==
[[File:仙-bw.png|thumb|[[Stroke order]] for ''xian'' 仙]]
The word ''xiān'' is written with three characters [[Wikt:僊|僊]], [[Wikt:仙|仙]], or [[Wikt:仚|仚]], which combine the logographic "[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]" ''rén'' (人 or 亻 "person; human") with two "phonetic" elements (see [[Chinese character classification]]). The oldest recorded ''xiān'' character 僊 has a ''xiān'' ("rise up; ascend") phonetic supposedly because immortals could "ascend into the heavens". (Compare ''qiān'' 遷 "move; transfer; change" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern ''xiān'' character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a ''shān'' (山 "mountain") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper (1993:164) interprets "'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain.' The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature."

The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as ''xiānxiān'' (僊僊 "dance lightly; hop about; jump around"), and rhymed with ''qiān'' (遷). "But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering." (tr. [[James Legge]])[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005113/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?lang=fr&amp;no=220&amp;l=Shijing] [[Joseph Needham|Needham]] and [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang]] (1956:134) suggest ''xian'' was cognate with ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' 巫 "shamanic" dancing. Paper (1995:55) writes, "the function of the term ''xian'' in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, "to live for a long time" has no etymological relation to ''xian'', it may be a later accretion."

The 121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|偓佺}}}} ({{linktext|Wòquán}} "name of an ancient immortal"). It defines 僊 as "live long and move away" and 仚 as "appearance of a person on a mountaintop".

==Textual references==
This section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe ''xian'' "immortals; transcendents". While the early ''Zhuangzi'', ''Chuci'', and ''Liezi'' texts allegorically used ''xian'' immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the ''Shenxian zhuan'' and ''Baopuzi'' took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity. On one the hand, ''[[neidan]]'' (內丹 "internal alchemy") techniques included ''taixi'' (胎息 "embryo respiration") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and [[Tao Yin]] exercises (which later evolved into [[Qigong]] and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]). On the other hand, ''[[waidan]]'' (外丹 "external alchemy") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like [[inedia]].

The earliest representations of Chinese immortals, dating from the [[Han Dynasty]], portray them flying with feathery wings (the word ''yuren'' 羽人 "feathered person" later meant "Daoist") or riding dragons. In [[Chinese art]], ''xian'' are often pictured with symbols of immortality including the dragon, crane, fox, white deer, pine tree, peach, and mushroom. [[File:Dragon gods - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|''Xian'' riding dragons&lt;ref name=werner/&gt;]]
[[File:蝦蟇・鉄拐仙人図 曾我蕭白.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Paintings of ''xian'' by Soga Shōhaku 曾我蕭白, ca. 1760.]]

Besides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of ''xian''. ''Xian'' (仙) occurs in the ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'', ''[[Fengsu Tongyi]]'', ''[[Qian fu lun]]'', ''Fayan'', and ''Shenjian''; ''xian'' (僊) occurs in the ''Caizhong langji'', ''Fengsu Tongyi'', ''Guanzi'', and ''Shenjian''.

===''Zhuangzi''===
Two circa 3rd century BCE "Outer Chapters" of the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (莊子 "[Book of] Master Zhuang") use the archaic character ''xian'' 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about "Cloud Chief" (雲 將)  and "Big Concealment" (鴻濛) that uses the ''Shijing'' compound ''xianxian'' ("dance; jump"):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Big Concealment said, "If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!"&lt;br&gt;"Then what should I do?" said Cloud Chief.&lt;br&gt;"Ah," said Big Concealment, "you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!"&lt;br&gt;Cloud Chief said, "Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!"&lt;br&gt;"Well, then—mind‑nourishment!" said Big Concealment. "You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves."&lt;br&gt;Cloud Chief said, "The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11, tr. [[Burton Watson]] 1968:122-3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 12 uses ''xian'' when mythical [[Emperor Yao]] describes a ''shengren'' (聖 人 "sagely person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;The true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12, tr. Watson 1968:130)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Without using the word ''xian'', several ''Zhuangzi'' passages employ ''xian'' imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE "Inner Chapters", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1, tr. Watson 1968:32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second is this description of a ''shenren'' (神人 "divine person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the [[Four Seas]]. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1, tr. Watson 1968:33) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors of the ''Zhuangzi'' had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complimentary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (''changshengbulao'' 長生不老 "live forever and never age") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. "You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old," said Hui Tzu. "It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?"

Chuang Tzu said, "You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter."&lt;br&gt;"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18, tr. Watson 1968:191–2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the ''Zhuangzi''. (1995:100) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chuci''===
[[File:WuXianGuan-Immortals-footprint-0519.jpg|thumb|The supposed "footprint of a ''xian''", a little pond in Guangzhou's Temple of the Five Immortals]]
The 3rd-2nd century BCE ''[[Chuci]]'' (楚辭 "Lyrics of Chu") anthology of poems uses ''xian'' 仙 once and ''xian'' 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist ''xian'' immortals [[Chisongzi|Chi Song]] (赤松 "[[Red Pine (disambiguation)|Red Pine]]", see Kohn 1993:142–4) and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under [[Shennong]], the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of [[King Ling of Zhou]] (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen.

The "''[[Yuan You]]''" (遠遊 "Far-off Journey") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.
&lt;blockquote&gt;My spirit darted forth and did not return to me,&lt;br&gt;And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.&lt;br&gt;Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,&lt;br&gt;And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.&lt;br&gt;In emptiness and silence I found serenity;&lt;br&gt;In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.&lt;br&gt;I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:&lt;br&gt;I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.&lt;br&gt;I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,&lt;br&gt;And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.&lt;br&gt;They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,&lt;br&gt;Leaving a famous name that endures after them. (tr. Hawkes 1985:194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Sorrow for Troth Betrayed|Xi shi]]''" (惜誓 "Sorrow for Troth Betrayed") resembles the "''Yuan You''", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. "Though unoriginal in theme," says Hawkes (1985:239), "its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive."
&lt;blockquote&gt;We gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad people&lt;br&gt;As we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.&lt;br&gt;In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:&lt;br&gt;There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.&lt;br&gt;The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:&lt;br&gt;I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.&lt;br&gt;In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,&lt;br&gt;Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.&lt;br&gt;But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,&lt;br&gt;Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning. (tr. Hawkes 1985:240) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Ai shi ming]]''" (哀時命 "Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Far and forlorn, with no hope of return:&lt;br&gt;Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.&lt;br&gt;Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;&lt;br&gt;Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.&lt;br&gt;I enter into friendship with Red Pine;&lt;br&gt;I join Wang Qiao as his companion.
We send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;&lt;br&gt;The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.&lt;br&gt;Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;&lt;br&gt;Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure. tr. Hawkes 1985:266) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Li Sao]]''" (離騷 "On Encountering Trouble"), the most famous ''Chuci'' poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist ''xian''.

Some other ''Chuci'' poems refer to immortals with synonyms of ''xian''. For instance, "''Shou zhi''" (守志 "Maintaining Resolution), uses ''[[zhenren]]'' (真人 "true person", tr. "Pure Ones" above in "''Yuan You''"), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as ''zhen xianren'' (真仙人 "true immortal person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;I visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,&lt;br&gt;Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,&lt;br&gt;Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,&lt;br&gt;Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,&lt;br&gt;Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,&lt;br&gt;Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life. (tr. Hawkes 1985:318) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Liezi''===
The ''[[Liezi]]'' (列子 "[Book of] Master Lie"), which Louis Komjathy (2004:36) says "was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)", uses ''xian'' four times, always in the compound ''xiansheng'' (仙聖 "immortal sage").

Nearly half of Chapter 2 ("The [[Yellow Emperor]]") comes from the ''Zhuangzi'', including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. (tr. Graham 1960:35) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 5 uses ''xiansheng'' three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] (湯) of the [[Shang Dynasty]] and Ji (革) of the [[Xia Dynasty]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;T'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'&lt;br&gt;—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named "The Entry to the Void". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles  carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.&lt;br&gt;'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' (tr. Graham 1960:97–8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Penglai Mountain]] became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the [[elixir of life]] supposedly grew, and is known as [[Horai]] in Japanese legends. The first emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent his court alchemist [[Xu Fu]] on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).

Holmes Welch (1957:88–97) analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a "hygiene school" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]] philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of "immortality". This is what he concludes about ''xian''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word ''hsien'', or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the ''hsien'' in later times, nonetheless the ''hsien'' ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the ''natural'' powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a ''genre'' which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it. (Welch 1957:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Shenxian zhuan''===
[[File:Nanyang-Xijiao-Qilingang-Xianren-cheng-gui-tu.jpg|thumb|An immortal riding a tortoise. A [[Han Dynasty]] painting]]
The ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals") is a [[hagiography]] of ''xian''. Although it was traditionally attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283–343 CE), Komjathy (2004:43) says, "The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest."

According to the ''Shenxian zhuan'', there are four schools of immortality:

'''''[[Ch'i|Qì]]''''' (气—“energy”): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.&lt;br&gt;But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation]." (Campany 2002:21) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Fàn''''' (饭—“Diet”): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the ''Sān Shī Fàn'' (三尸饭—“Three-Corpses food”)—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, [[leeks]], and [[scallions]]) and [[grain]]s. The ''Shenxian zhuan'' uses this story to illustrate the importance of ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' "grain avoidance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"During the reign of [[Emperor Cheng of Han|Emperor Cheng of the Han]], hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] [[Ziying|Emperor Ziying]]. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']&lt;br&gt;The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent." (Campany 2002:22–23) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Fángzhōng Zhī Shù''''' (房中之术—“Arts of the Bedchamber”): [[Taoist sexual practices|Sexual yoga]]. (Campany 2002:30–31) According to a discourse between the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the immortaless ''Sùnǚ'' (素女—“Plain Girl”), one of the three daughters of [[Hsi Wang Mu]],
&lt;blockquote&gt; “The sexual behaviors between a man and woman are identical to how the universe itself came into creation. Like Heaven and Earth, the male and female share a parallel relationship in attaining an immortal existence. They both must learn how to engage and develop their natural sexual instincts and behaviors; otherwise the only result is decay and traumatic discord of their physical lives. However, if they engage in the utmost joys of sensuality and apply the principles of yin and yang to their sexual activity, their health, vigor, and joy of love will bear them the fruits of longevity and immortality. (Hsi 2002:99–100) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress "Toppest") Manual'', a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,
&lt;blockquote&gt; “A female can completely restore her youthfulness and attain immortality if she refrains from allowing just one or two men in her life from stealing and destroying her [sexual] essence, which will only serve in aging her at a rapid rate and bring about an early death. However, if she can acquire the sexual essence of a thousand males through absorption, she will acquire the great benefits of youthfulness and immortality.” (Hsi 2001:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Dān''''' (丹—"[[Alchemy#Chinese alchemy|Alchemy]]", literally "[[Cinnabar]]"): [[Elixir of life#China|Elixir of Immortality]].(Campany 2002:31)

===''Baopuzi''===
The 4th century CE ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (抱朴子 "[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity"), which was written by [[Ge Hong]], gives some highly detailed descriptions of ''xian''.

The text lists three classes of immortals:

*'''''Tiānxiān''''' (天仙—“Celestial Immortal”): The highest level.
*'''''Dìxiān''''' (地仙—“Earth Immortal”): The middle level.
*'''''[[Shijie (Daoism)|Shījiě]] xiān''''' (尸解仙—"Escaped-by-means-of-a-stimulated-corpse-simulacrum Immortal", literally "[[Shi (personator)|Corpse]] Untie Immortal"): The lowest level. This is considered the lowest form of immortality since a person must first “fake” their own death by substituting a bewitched object like a bamboo pole, sword, [[Amulet|talisman]] or a shoe for their corpse or slipping a type of [[Death certificate]] into the coffin of a newly departed paternal grandfather, thus having their name and "allotted life span" deleted from the ledgers kept by the ''Sīmìng'' (司命—"Director of allotted life spans", literally "Controller of Fate"). [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]] and folktales abound of people who seemingly die in one province, but are seen alive in another. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact the ''Ling bao tai xuan yin sheng zhi fu'' (靈寳太玄隂生之符—“Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding”) to protect themselves from heavenly retribution (Campany 2002:52–60). However, this is not a true form of immortality. For each misdeed a person commits, the Director of allotted life spans subtracts days and sometimes years from their allotted life span. This method allows a person to live out the entirety of their allotted lifespan (whether it be 30, 80, 400, etc.) and avoid the agents of death. But the body still has to be transformed into an immortal one, hence the phrase ''Xiānsǐ hòutuō'' (先死後脱—“The ‘death’ is apparent, [but] the sloughing off of the body’s mortality remains to be done.”). Sometimes the ''Shījiě'' are employed by heaven to act as celestial peace keepers. Therefore, they have no need for hiding from retribution since they are empowered by heaven to perform their duties. There are three levels of heavenly ''Shījiě'':
**'''''Dìxià zhǔ''''' (地下主—“Agents Beneath the Earth”): Are in charge of keeping the peace within the [[Diyu|Chinese underworld]]. They are eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality after 280 years of faithful service.
**'''''Dìshàng zhǔzhě''''' (地上主者—"Agents Above the Earth"): Are given magic talismans which prolong their lives (but not indefinitely) and allow them to heal the sick and exorcize demons and evil spirits from the earth. This level was ''not'' eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality.
**'''''Zhìdì jūn''''' (制地君—"Lords Who Control the Earth"): A heavenly decree ordered them to "disperse all subordinate junior demons, whether high or low [in rank], that have cause afflictions and injury owing to blows or offenses against the Motion of the Year, the Original Destiny, Great Year, the Kings of the Soil or the establishing or breaking influences of the chronograms of the tome. Annihilate them all." This level was also ''not'' eligible for promotion to immortality.

These titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was '''Fei Changfang''', who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution. (Campany 2002:52–60)

[[Ge Hong]] wrote in his book ''The Master Who Embraces Simplicity'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death. (Hsi 2001:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji''===
[[Image:Changchun-Temple-Small-statue-0301.jpg|thumb|[[He-He er xian|Hé (和) and Hé (合)]],  the two "Immortals of Harmony and Unity", associated with happy marriage, depicted in Changchun Temple, a Taoist temple in [[Wuhan]]]]
The ''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji'' (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 "Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]") is associated with [[Zhongli Quan]] (2nd century CE?) and [[Lü Dongbin]] (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called “Zhong-Lü” (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (''neidan''). Komjathy (2004:57) describes it as, "Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods."

The ''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji'' lists five classes of immortals:

*'''''Guǐxiān''''' (鬼仙—"Ghost Immortal"): A person who cultivates too much [[Yin and Yang|yin]] energy. These immortals are likened to [[Vampires]] because they drain the life essence of the living, much like the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. Ghost immortals do not leave the realm of ghosts.
*'''''Rénxiān''''' (人仙—Human Immortal”): Humans have an equal balance of yin and yang energies, so they have the potential of becoming either a ghost or immortal. Although they continue to hunger and thirst and require clothing and shelter like a normal human, these immortals do not suffer from aging or sickness. Human immortals do not leave the realm of humans. There are many sub-classes of human immortals, as discussed above under '''''[[Xian (Taoism)#Baopuzi|Shījiě xiān]]'''''.
*'''''Dìxiān''''' (地仙—“Earth Immortal”): When the yin is transformed into the pure yang, a true immortal body will emerge that does not need food, drink, clothing or shelter and is not affected by hot or cold temperatures. Earth immortals do not leave the realm of earth. These immortals are forced to stay on earth until they shed their human form.
*'''''Shénxiān''''' (神仙—"Spirit Immortal"): The immortal body of the earthbound class will eventually change into vapor through further practice. They have supernatural powers and can take on the shape of any object. These immortals must remain on earth acquiring merit by teaching mankind about the [[Tao]]. Spirit immortals do not leave the realm of spirits. Once enough merit is accumulated, they are called to heaven by a celestial decree.
*'''''Tiānxiān''''' (天仙—“Celestial Immortal”): Spirit immortals who are summoned to heaven are given the minor office of water realm judge. Over time, they are promoted to oversee the earth realm and finally become administrators of the celestial realm. These immortals have the power to travel back and forth between the earthly and celestial realms.

===''Śūraṅgama Sūtra''===
The ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of ''xian'' who exist between the world of [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] ("gods") and that of human beings. This position, in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] literature, is usually occupied by [[Asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s ("[[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s", "antigods"). These ''xian'' are not considered true cultivators of ''[[samadhi]]'' ("unification of mind"), as their methods differ from the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' ("meditation").&lt;ref&gt;Benn, James A. 2008, "[https://www.academia.edu/12082377/Another_Look_at_the_Pseudo-%C5%9A%C5%ABra%E1%B9%83gama_S%C5%ABtra Another Look at the Pseudo-Śūraṃgama sūtra]" pgs. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/Shurangama.htm Shurangama Sutra: Text, Commentaries, and Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Dìxiān''''' ({{zh|地(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Dìxíng xiān}}'', "earth-travelling immortals")&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly ingest special food called ''fuer'' (服餌).
*'''''Fēixiān''''' ({{zh|飛(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Fēixíng xiān}}'', “flying immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly ingest certain herbs and plants.
*'''''Yóuxiān''''' ({{zh|遊(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Yóuxíng xiān}}'', “roaming immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who “transform” by constantly ingesting metals and minerals.
