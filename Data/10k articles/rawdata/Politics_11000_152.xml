'''Abraham Guillén''' (13 March 1913 &amp;ndash; 1 August 1993), was a Spanish author, [[economist]] and educator. He was a veteran of [[Spanish Civil War]], influenced by [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. One of the most prolific revolutionary writers in Latin America during the 1960s and intellectual mentor of Uruguay's revolutionary Movement of National Liberation ([[Tupamaros]]). He is most widely known as the author of ''[[Strategy of the Urban Guerrilla]]'', which played an important role in the activities of urban guerrillas in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]].

==Biography==

Guillen was born in [[Guadalajara]] on March 13, 1913. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] he fought against the [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces, operating within the [[National Confederation of Labour]] (CNT), the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (FAI), and the [[General Union of Workers]] (UGT). At the end of the war, he was arrested by Franco's forces, condemned to death, and ultimately was sentenced to ten years in prison. He escaped from prison in 1945, fled Spain, and spent three years in France.

In 1948, he emigrated to Argentina. During the [[Juan Perón|Perón]] era, he worked as an editor for ''Economia y finanzas'' ("Economy and Finance"), and his contributions were published under the pseudonym, Jaime de las Heras. Under another pseudonym, that of Fernando Molina, he contributed to the [[Buenos Aires]] newspaper ''El Laborista''. His 1957 publication ''The Agony of Imperialism'', resulted in the loss of his job and his barring from employment as a journalist in Argentina. In 1960, he was employed briefly as an economic consultant to the Argentine government.
In 1961, he was imprisoned for a few months on the charge that he was a member of the Uturuncos, guerrillas active in northwest Argentina during 1960 and 1961. Following his imprisonment he sought political asylum in [[Montevideo]] in 1962 and soon made contact with revolutionary elements in that country. The first edition of ''Strategy of the Urban Guerrilla'' was published in 1966. It served as a counter to the rural insurrectionist methods espoused by [[Che Guevara]], although Guillen did agree with Guevara on several key issues and even authored the introduction to the Uruguayan edition of Guevara's ''Guerrilla Warfare''.

Guillen continued to publish frequently during this time period. He took a position as a journalist for the Montevideo newspaper ''Accion'', often using the pseudonym of Arapey. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was a constant subject of investigations both by Latin America police and by the [[CIA]]. In addition to Argentina and Uruguay, he also lived and worked in [[Peru]] and eventually returned to Madrid, Spain, where he taught theories of self-management and communal action. He died on August 1, 1993.

The political [[doctrine]] of '''anacyclosis''' (or ''anakyklosis'' from {{lang-el|ἀνακύκλωσις}}) is a cyclical theory of political evolution.  The theory of anacyclosis is based upon the Greek typology of constitutional forms of rule by the one, the few, and the many.  Anacyclosis states that three basic forms of "benign" government ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[democracy]]) are inherently weak and unstable, tending to degenerate rapidly into the three basic forms of "malignant" government ([[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[ochlocracy]]). "Ochlocracy" refers to mob rule, not the concept of democracy created in the late-18th century.  

According to the doctrine, "benign" governments have the interests of all at heart, whereas "malignant" governments have the interests of a select few at heart. However, all six are considered unworkable because the first three rapidly transform into the latter three due to political corruption. 

The idea of anacyclosis influenced theorists of [[republicanism]]. Some of them, including [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] and [[Kant]] suggested that [[mixed government]] might help to stabilize republics and prevent permanent anacyclosis. 

== Polybius' sequence ==
[[Polybius]]' sequence of anacyclosis proceeds in the following order:  1. monarchy, 2. kingship, 3. tyranny, 4. aristocracy, 5. oligarchy, 6. democracy, and 7. ochlocracy.  

According to Polybius' elaboration of the theory, the state begins in a form of primitive monarchy.  The state will emerge from monarchy under the leadership of an influential and wise king; this represents the emergence of "kingship".  Political power will pass by hereditary succession to the children of the king, who will abuse their authority for their own gain; this represents the degeneration of kingship into "tyranny".

Some of the more influential and powerful men of the state will grow weary of the abuses of tyrants, and will overthrow them; this represents the ascendancy of "aristocracy" (as well as the end of the "rule by the one" and the beginning of the "rule by the few").

Just as the descendants of kings, however, political influence will pass to the descendants of the aristocrats, and these descendants will begin to abuse their power and influence, as the tyrants before them; this represents the decline of aristocracy and the beginning of "oligarchy".  As Polybius explains, the people will by this stage in the political evolution of the state decide to take political matters into their own hands.

This point of the cycle sees the emergence of "democracy", as well as the beginning of "rule by the many". In the same way that the descendants of kings and aristocrats abused their political status, so too will the descendants of democrats.  Accordingly, democracy degenerates into "ochlocracy", literally, "mob-rule".  In an ochlocracy, according to Polybius, the people of the state will become corrupted, and will develop a sense of entitlement and will be conditioned to accept the [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] of demagogues.

Eventually, the state will be engulfed in chaos, and the competing claims of demagogues will culminate in a single (sometimes virtuous) demagogue claiming absolute power, bringing the state full-circle back to monarchy.

== Origin ==
This theory was developed in stages by the ancient Greek philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], but is mainly attributable to the ancient Greek historian [[Polybius]].  Polybius' explanation of anacyclosis is found in Book VI of ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]''.

== Historical references ==
[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] describes anacyclosis in his philosophical work ''[[De re publica]].''

[[Machiavelli]] references anacyclosis in Book I, Chapter II in his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]''.

[[Francesco Sansovino]] described anacyclosis his 1583 work ''Propositioni, Overo Considerationi in Materia di Cose di Stato Sotto Titolo di Avvertimenti, Avvedimenti Civili &amp; Concetti Politici''.

John Adams described anacyclosis in Letter XXXI (Ancient Republics, and Opinions of Philosophers) of his 1787 work ''Defense of the Constitutions of the United States''.

== Modern analysis ==
{{unref section|date=October 2017}}
Anacyclosis was evaluated in detail by F. W. Walbank in his ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius'' (Oxford, 1957) (see Volume I, Book VI).

Anacyclosis was also analyzed at length by G. W. Trompf in ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'' (University of California, 1979) (see Chapter 1: The Polybian Anacyclosis or Cycle of Governments).  

In 2013, The Institute for Anacyclosis, a nonpartisan, nonprofit corporation, was incorporated to research anacyclosis and related ideas. The Institute for Anacyclosis has developed an updated model of anacyclosis based on the classical Polybian version.&lt;!--???--&gt;

[[Jean-Claude Milner]] in his 2016 book ''Rereading the Revolution'' uses anacyclosis to read the French Revolution&lt;!--what does this mean? to read the French Revolution?--&gt; and its consequences.

'''Armando Valladares Perez''' (born May 30, 1937) is a Cuban poet, diplomat, and human rights activist. In 1960, he was arrested by the Cuban government for conflicting reasons; the Cuban government alleged that he had been complicit in anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[terrorism]],&lt;ref name="GranmaTerror"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allard|first1=Jean-Guy|title=And when will Miami’s terrorist nest be cleared out?|url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/juev11/Miami.html|website=Digital Granma Internacional|accessdate=11 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622101247/http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/juev11/Miami.html|archivedate=2011-06-22|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while foreign sources regarded his arrest as being due to his protesting communism,&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-09/magazine/tm-24022_1_political-prisoners |title=A Conversation With Armando Valladares |author=David Devoss |date=November 9, 1986 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher= |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Amnesty International]] to name him a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref name=RH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-humanity.com/?q=node/65 |title=Armando Valladares |author= |date=October 5, 2011 |work= |publisher=Radio Humanity |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release in 1982, he wrote a book detailing his imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Cuban government, and was appointed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to serve as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

==Arrest and imprisonment==
Valladares is from [[Pinar del Rio]], Cuba.&lt;ref name=BIO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armandovalladares.com/bio/ |title=About |year=2012 |work=www.armandovalladares.com |publisher=Armando Valladares Gallery |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his own account, he was initially a supporter of [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuban Revolution]], later becoming an employee of the Office of the Ministry of Communications for the Revolutionary Government, for which he worked at a post office.&lt;ref name=BIO /&gt;&lt;ref name=OFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/armando_valladares.html |title=Armando Valladares |publisher=Oslo Freedom Forum |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829085353/http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/armando_valladares.html |archivedate=August 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, at the age of 23, he reportedly refused to put an "I'm with Fidel" sign on his desk at work.&lt;ref name=OFF /&gt; Shortly after, he was arrested by political police at his parents' home.&lt;ref name=DH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/12/4/173407.shtml |title=Armando Valladares: Human Rights Hero |author=David Horowitz |date=5 December 2003 |work= |publisher=Newsmax |accessdate=12 April 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016220652/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/12/4/173407.shtml| archive-date= October 16, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently given a thirty-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=BIO /&gt; The Cuban government stated that his arrest was on charges of terrorism, and that he had previously worked for the secret police of [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s dictatorship.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/28/world/us-charges-cuba-smears-delegate.html |title=U.S. Charges Cuba Smears Delegate |author=Paul Lewis |date=February 28, 1988 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international human rights organizations [[Oslo Freedom Forum]], [[PEN International]], and [[Amnesty International]], in contrast, stated their belief that Valladares had been imprisoned solely for his anti-Castro stance, and the latter organization named him a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFF/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/books/surviving-castro-s-tortures.html?pagewanted=all |title=Surviving Castro's Tortures |author=Ronald Radosh |date=April 13, 2012 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valladares states that he was offered "political rehabilitation" early in his prison term, but refused. According to Valladares, this led to his being abused and tortured by his guards, including being forced to eat other people's excrement&lt;ref name=DH/&gt; and imprisonment in cramped "drawer cells" in which multiple prisoners were confined in a space too small to lie down, without being allowed toilet access.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

Describing his incarceration later, Valladares wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For me, it meant 8,000 days of hunger, of systematic beatings, of hard labor, of solitary confinement and solitude, 8,000 days of struggling to prove that I was a human being, 8,000 days of proving that my spirit could triumph over exhaustion and pain, 8,000 days of testing my religious convictions, my faith, of fighting the hate my atheist jailers were trying to instill in me with each bayonet thrust, fighting so that hate would not flourish in my heart, 8,000 days of struggling so that I would not become like them.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Describing his thoughts on [[Che Guevara]] later, Valladares stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was a man full of hatred ... Che Guevara executed dozens and dozens of people who never once stood trial and were never declared guilty … In his own words, he said the following: "At the smallest of doubt we must execute." And that's what he did at the Sierra Maestra and the prison of Las Cabanas.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing and release==
During his time in prison, Valladares went on multiple hunger strikes. The longest, a 49-day hunger strike in 1974, left him using a wheelchair several years&lt;ref name=MH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IEmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VAEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1133,2889693&amp;dq=prisoner-of-conscience+armando+valladares&amp;hl=en |title=83 Congressmen ask Castro to free poet Valladares |author=Ana Veciana-Suarez |date=March 19, 1982 |work=The Miami News |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an attack of [[polyneuritis]].&lt;ref name=IACHR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/81.82eng/cuba2300.htm |title=Resolution No 2/82: Case 2300 |date=March 8, 1982 |publisher=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valladares subsequently appealed to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] of the [[Organization of American States]], stating that he was being denied important medical care, including a functioning wheelchair.&lt;ref name=IACHR /&gt; The IACHR found that Cuba had violated a number of Valladares's rights, including the right to a fair trial, the right to protection against arbitrary arrest and the right to humane treatment during the time the individual is in custody, and the right to due process and protection from cruel, infamous, or unusual punishment.&lt;ref name=IACHR /&gt;

Believing that "poetry is a weapon," Valladares also began smuggling his poems out of jail, which brought him a measure of international attention.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; His first published collection, ''From My Wheelchair'', detailed prison abuses and was released in 1974. After the book's publication, PEN France awarded him its Freedom Prize.&lt;ref name=MH/&gt;

In 1981, Valladares's wife Marta – who had met and married him while he was imprisoned – traveled to Europe to meet with government officials regarding her husband's case, and in 1982, 83 [[U.S. Congressmen]] joined a call for Valladares's release.&lt;ref name=MH/&gt; Valladares was released that year after 22 years' imprisonment after a direct appeal by [[French President]] [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; 

The Cuban government has made unconfirmed, unsubstantiated claims that Valladares was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent prior to his arrest and after his release from prison.&lt;ref name="GranmaTerror" /&gt;

==''Against All Hope'' and ambassadorship==
After his release, Valladares resettled in the U.S. In 1986, [[Alfred A. Knopf]] released Valladares's memoir ''Against All Hope'', in which he detailed his prison experiences. One year later, U.S. President Ronald Reagan appointed Valladares to serve as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. The move was widely seen as an attempt to dramatize and draw new attention to Cuban human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The Cuban government reacted by calling Valladares a "traitor and a fake,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:S17NO9-1592: |title=Castro Laments `Very Sad Things' in Bloc |author= |date=November 9, 1989 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including stating that he had faked his paralysis while imprisoned. The [[U.S. State Department]] responded by accusing Cuba of "mounting a massive defamation campaign against Armando Valladares" to deflect attention from its human rights record.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; In 1985, he signs a petition in support for the far-right paramilitary [[Contras]] ([[Nicaragua]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/document/bhlnicaragua|title=Quand Bernard-Henri Lévy pétitionnait contre le régime légal du Nicaragua|author=|date=1 October 2009|website=monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valladares served as the ambassador from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Tones Down Strategy to Fight Cuba on Human Rights | newspaper=[[Miami Herald]] | date=February 28, 1988 |page = 1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sims Flap Shows Miami at Divisive Worst | newspaper=[[Miami Herald]] | date=January 8, 1991 |page=  1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vigorously argued for UN attention to Cuban human rights abuses during his tenure, leading [[Human Rights Watch]] to criticize him for appearing to have "little interest in pursuing other violators, particularly of the non-Communist sort," such as US allies Iraq or Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Cuba.htm |title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989 |year=1989 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|Draft of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], also from 1789]]
A '''bill of rights''', sometimes called a '''declaration of rights''' or a '''charter of rights''', is a list of the most important [[rights]] to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against [[Civil and political rights|infringement from public officials and private citizens]]. 

Bills of rights may be ''[[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]'' or ''unentrenched''. An entrenched bill of rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure, instead requiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments. A bill of rights that is ''not entrenched'' is a normal [[statute law]] and as such can be modified or repealed by the legislature at will. 

In practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights articulated in its bill of rights.

==History==

The history of legal [[charter]]s asserting certain  rights for particular groups goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. An example is [[Magna Carta]], an English legal charter agreed between the King and his barons in 1215.&lt;ref name=Rau2016&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rau|editor1-first=Zbigniew|editor2-last=Żurawski vel Grajewski|editor2-first=Przemysław|editor3-last=Tracz-Tryniecki|editor3-first=Marek|title=Magna Carta: A Central European Perspective of Our Common Heritage of Freedom|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=1317278593|page=xvi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBHeCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Britain in its history proposed many pioneering documents - not only Magna Carta, 1215 but those such as the Provisions of Oxford 1258, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right 1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]], there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Petition of Right 1628]], the [[Declaration of Right, 1689]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] established certain rights in statute.

In America, the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]], which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|United States Declaration of Independence]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Maier|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Maier|title=American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence|year=1997|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-45492-6|pages=126-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] asserted the universality of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs78fI7vzYAhWJLsAKHdOID1kQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271040130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1789 by France's [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], during the period of the [[French Revolution]].

After the [[Constitution of the United States]] was adopted in 1789, the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was ratified in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d52OVwT_6PYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Rights of Mankind: A History of the American Bill of Rights|last=Schwartz|first=Bernard|date=1992|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780945612285|pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yyQXl4LmdAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Bill of Rights and the States: The Colonial and Revolutionary Origins of American Liberties|last=Conley|first=Patrick T.|last2=States|first2=U.

The 20th century saw different groups draw on these earlier documents for influence when drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions in Western democracies==
The [[constitution of the United Kingdom]] remains uncodified,&lt;ref name=Rau2016/&gt; however the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.

'''Calculus of voting''' refers to any [[mathematical model]] which predicts voting behaviour by an electorate, including such features as participation rate.  A calculus of voting represents an hypothesized decision-making process.

These models are used in [[political science]] in an attempt to capture the relative importance of various factors influencing an elector to vote (or not vote) in a particular way.

==Example==

One such model was proposed by [[Anthony Downs]] (1957) and is adapted by [[William H. Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook]], in “A Theory of the Calculus of Voting” (Riker and Ordeshook 1968)

:''V'' = ''pB'' &amp;minus; ''C'' + ''D''

where
:''V'' = the proxy for the probability that the voter will turn out 
:''p'' = probability of vote “mattering”
:''B'' = “utility” benefit of voting--differential benefit of one candidate winning over the other 
:''C'' = costs of voting (time/effort spent)
:''D'' = citizen duty, goodwill feeling, psychological and civic benefit of voting (this term is not included in Downs's original model)

A [[political science]] model based on [[rational choice]] used to explain why citizens do or do not vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}.

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001).

"'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009).

''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

Physical or [[Corporal punishment|''corporal'' punishment]] by a [[parent]] or other [[legal guardian]] is any act causing deliberate physical [[pain]] or discomfort to a [[minor child]] in response to some undesired behavior. It typically takes the form of [[spanking]] or slapping the child with an open hand or striking with an implement such as a belt, slipper, [[Caning|cane]], hairbrush or [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle]], and can also include shaking, pinching, forced ingestion of substances, or forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions. 
 
Social acceptance of corporal punishment is high in countries where it remains lawful, particularly among more traditional groups. In many cultures, parents have historically been regarded as having the right, if not the duty, to physically [[punish]] misbehaving children in order to teach appropriate [[behavior]]. Researchers, on the other hand, point out that corporal punishment typically has the opposite effect, leading to more [[aggressive]] behavior in children and less long-term [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Other adverse effects, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[anti-social behavior]] and increased risk of [[physical abuse]], have also been linked to the use of corporal punishment by parents. Evidence shows that spanking and other physical punishments, while nominally for the purpose of [[child discipline]], are inconsistently applied, often being used when parents are angry or under [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]. Severe forms of corporal punishment, including kicking, biting, scalding and burning, can also constitute unlawful [[child abuse]].

International human-rights and treaty bodies such as the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] have advocated an end to all forms of corporal punishment, arguing that it violates children's dignity and right to [[bodily integrity]]. Many existing laws against [[battery (crime)|battery]], assault, and/or child abuse make exceptions for "reasonable" physical punishment by parents, a defence rooted in [[common law]] and specifically [[English law]]. During the late 20th and into the 21st century, some countries began removing legal defences for adult guardians' use of corporal punishment, followed by outright bans on the practice. Most of these bans are part of [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and therefore do not impose [[criminal law|criminal]] penalties unless a charge of assault and/or battery is justified. Since [[Sweden]] outlawed all corporal punishment of children in 1979, an increasing number of countries have enacted similar bans, particularly following international adoption of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. However, domestic corporal punishment of children remains legal in most of the world.

== Forms of punishment ==

The [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] defines ''corporal punishment'' as "any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light".&lt;ref name=ViolenceStudy3/&gt; [[Paulo Sergio Pinheiro]], reporting on a worldwide study on violence against children for the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]], writes:

{{quote |Corporal punishment involves hitting ('smacking', 'slapping', 'spanking') children, with the hand or with an implement – whip, stick, belt, shoe, wooden spoon, etc. But it can also involve, for example, kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion (for example, washing children's mouths out with soap or forcing them to swallow hot spices).&lt;ref name=ViolenceStudy3&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinheiro, Paulo Sérgio |date=2006 |chapter=Violence against children in the home and family |chapterurl=http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/3.%20World%20Report%20on%20Violence%20against%20Children.pdf |title=World Report on Violence Against Children |location=Geneva, Switzerland |publisher=United Nations Secretary-General's Study on Violence Against Children |isbn=92-95057-51-1 |url=http://www.unviolencestudy.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], "Corporal punishment involves the application of some form of physical pain in response to undesirable behavior", and "ranges from slapping the hand of a child about to touch a hot stove to identifiable [[child abuse]], such as beatings, scaldings and burnings. Because of this range in the form and severity of punishment, its use as a discipline strategy is controversial".&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"/&gt; The term "corporal punishment" is often used interchangeably with "physical punishment" or "physical discipline". In the context of causing pain in order to punish, it is distinct from physically restraining a child to protect the child or another person from harm.&lt;ref name=Phoenix&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Among various pre-existing factors that influence whether parents use physical punishment are: experience with physical punishment as a child, knowledge about [[child development]], [[socioeconomic]] status, parental education and religious [[ideology]]. Favorable attitudes toward the use of physical punishment are also a significant predictor of its use.&lt;ref name=RisksAlternatives&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Ateah C.A. |author2=Secco M.L. |author3=Woodgate R.L. |title=The risks and alternatives to physical punishment use with children |journal=J Pediatr Health Care |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=126–32 |year=2003 |pmid=12734459 |doi=10.1067/mph.2003.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child-development researcher [[Elizabeth Gershoff]] writes that parents are more likely to use physical punishment if:

{{quote|They strongly favor it and believe in its effectiveness; they were themselves physically punished as children; they have a cultural background, namely their religion, their ethnicity, and/or their country of origin, that they perceive approves of the use of physical punishment; they are socially disadvantaged, in that they have low income, low education, or live in a disadvantaged neighborhood; they are experiencing stress (such as that precipitated by financial hardships or marital conflict), mental health symptoms, or diminished emotional well-being; they report being frustrated or aggravated with their children on a regular basis; they are under 30 years of age; the child being punished is a preschooler (2-5 years old); [and] the child's misbehavior involves hurting someone else or putting themselves in danger.&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt;}}

Parents tend to use corporal punishment on children out of a desire for obedience, both in the short and long term, and especially to reduce children's aggressive behaviors. This despite a significant body of evidence that physically punishing children tends to have the opposite effect, namely, a decrease in long-term compliance and an increase in aggression. Other reasons for parents' use of physical punishment may be to communicate the parent's displeasure with the child, to assert their authority and simple tradition.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gershoff, Elizabeth T. |date=Spring 2010 |title=More Harm Than Good: A Summary of Scientific Research on the Intended and Unintended Effects of Corporal Punishment on Children |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/3/ |journal=Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke University School of Law |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=31–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents also appear to use physical punishment on children as an outlet for anger. The American Academy of Pediatrics notes that "Parents are more likely to use aversive techniques of discipline when they are angry or irritable, depressed, fatigued, and stressed", and estimates that such release of pent-up anger makes parents more likely to hit or spank their children in the future.&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"/&gt; Parents commonly resort to spanking after losing their temper and most parents surveyed expressed significant feelings of anger, remorse and agitation while physically punishing their children. According to the AAP, "These findings challenge most the notion that parents can spank in a calm, planned manner".&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"/&gt;

== Society and culture ==

In a 2005 study, findings from [[China]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]] revealed differences in the reported use of corporal punishment, its acceptance in society and its relation to children’s social adjustment. Where corporal punishment was perceived as being more culturally accepted, it was less strongly associated with [[aggression]] and [[anxiety]] in children. However, corporal punishment was still positively associated with child aggression and anxiety in all countries studied.&lt;ref name=SocialSciences/&gt; Associations between corporal punishment and increased child aggression have been documented in the countries listed above as well as in [[Jamaica]], [[Jordan]] and [[Singapore]],  as have links between corporal punishment of children and later antisocial behavior in [[Brazil]],
[[Hong Kong]], [[Jordan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. According to Elizabeth Gershoff, these findings appear to challenge the notion that corporal punishment is "good" for children, even in [[culture]]s with histories of violence.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt;

Researchers have found that while the use of corporal punishment predicts variation in children's aggression less strongly in countries where there is more social acceptance of it, cultures in which corporal punishment is more accepted have higher overall levels of societal [[violence]].&lt;ref name=SocialSciences/&gt;

A 2013 study by [[Murray A. Straus]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]] found that children across numerous cultures who were spanked committed more [[crimes]] as adults than children who were not spanked, regardless of the quality of their relationship to their parents.&lt;ref name="Science Daily 22-11-13"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131122103621.htm |title= College students more likely to be lawbreakers if spanked as children |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 November 2013 |publisher= Science Daily |access-date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions vary across cultures on whether spanking and other forms of physical punishment are appropriate techniques for child-rearing. For example, in the United States and United Kingdom, social acceptance of spanking children maintains a majority position, from approximately 61% to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Reaves |first= Jessica |title= Survey Gives Children Something to Cry About

By 1996, the rate was 11%&lt;ref name=SocialSciences/&gt; and less than 34% considered it acceptable in a national survey.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics  Sweden. (1996). Spanking and other forms of physical punishment. Stockholm: Statistics Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gershoff posits that corporal punishment in the United States is largely supported by "a constellation of beliefs about family and child rearing, namely that children are property, that children do not have the right to negotiate their treatment by parents, and that behaviors within families are private".&lt;ref name=Burden/&gt;

Social acceptance toward, and prevalence of, corporal punishment by parents in some countries remains high despite a growing scientific consensus that the risks of substantial harm outweigh the potential benefits.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt; Social psychologists posit that this divergence between popular opinion and empirical evidence may be rooted in [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sanderson | first1 = Catherine Ashley | title = Social psychology | year = 2010 | publisher = Wiley | location = Hoboken, NJ. | isbn = 0-471-25026-0 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Marshall |first1= Michael J. |title= Why spanking doesn't work: stopping this bad habit and getting the upper hand on effective discipline |year=2002 |publisher= Bonneville Books |location= Springville, Utah |isbn= 1-55517-603-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="progressive-parenting.com"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kirby |first= Gena |title= Confessions of an AP Mom Who Spanked - Progressive Parenting |url= http://progressive-parenting.com/2012/06/28/confessions-of-an-ap-mom-who-spanked/ |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as the US and UK, spanking is legal but overt [[child abuse]] is both illegal and highly stigmatized socially.  Because of this, any parent who has ever spanked a child would find it extremely difficult to accept the research findings. If they did acknowledge, even in the smallest way, that spanking was harmful, they would likely feel they are admitting they harmed their own child and thus are a child abuser.  Similarly, adults who were spanked as children often face similar cognitive dissonance, because admitting it is harmful might be perceived as accusing their parents of abuse and might also be admitting to having been [[Victimization#Self-image of victimisation .28victim mentality.29|victimized]] in a situation where they were helpless to stop it. Such feelings would cause intense emotional discomfort, driving them to dismiss the scientific evidence in favor of weak [[anecdotal evidence]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distorted self-reflection]].&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; This is commonly expressed as "I spanked my children and they all turned out fine" or "I was spanked and I turned out fine."&lt;ref name="progressive-parenting.com" /&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2017}}

Traditionally, corporal punishment of minor children is legal unless it is explicitly outlawed. According to a 2014 estimate by [[Human Rights Watch]], "Ninety percent of the world’s children live in countries where corporal punishment and other physical violence against children is still legal".&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/17/25th-anniversary-convention-rights-child "25th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child"]. Human Rights Watch. 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries' laws provide for a defence of "reasonable chastisement" against charges of assault and other crimes for parents using corporal punishment. The defence is ultimately derived from [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal defences for corporal punishment of children derived from English law |date=10 November 2015 |publisher=Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/assets/pdfs/miscellaneous/English%20legal%20defences.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Nepal]] banned corporal punishment in September 2018, corporal punishment of children by parents (or other adults) is banned in 58 countries.&lt;ref name="States which"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/ |title=States which have prohibited all corporal punishment |publisher=Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of countries banning all forms of corporal punishment against children has grown significantly since the 1989 adoption of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], when only four countries had such bans.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Elizabeth Gershoff writes that {{as of|2008|lc=y}}, most of these bans are written into various countries' [[civil code]]s, rather than their [[criminal code]]s; they largely do not make a special crime of striking a child, but instead establish that assaults against persons of all ages are to be treated similarly. According to Gershoff, the intent of such bans on corporal punishment is not typically to prosecute parents, but to set a higher social standard for caregiving of children.&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt;

===Religious views===

[[Pope Francis]] has declared his approval of the use of corporal punishment by parents, as long as punishments do not "demean" children.  The [[Holy See|Vatican]] commission appointed to advise the Pope on [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse within the church]] criticized the Pope for his statement, contending that physical punishments and the infliction of pain were inappropriate methods for disciplining children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://m.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2015/0207/Spanking-OK-Why-Vatican-sex-abuse-commission-disagrees-with-Pope-video |title=Spanking OK? Why Vatican sex abuse commission disagrees with Pope |author=Laine, Samantha |date=7 February 2015 |website= Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] of the [[Council of Europe]] asserts that "While freedom of religious belief should be respected, such beliefs cannot justify practices which breach the rights of others, including children’s rights to respect for their physical integrity and human dignity". They maintain that "Mainstream faith communities and respected leaders are now supporting moves to prohibit and eliminate all violence against children", including corporal punishment.&lt;ref name="Commissioner Human Rights"/&gt; In 2006, a group of 800 religious leaders at the World Assembly of [[Religions for Peace]] in [[Kyoto, Japan]] endorsed a statement urging governments to adopt legislation banning all corporal punishment of children.&lt;ref name="Abolishing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abolishing corporal punishment of children : questions and answers.|date=2007 |publisher=Council of Europe|location=Strasbourg|isbn=978-9-287-16310-3|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/corporalpunishment/pdf/EnglishQuestionAnswer_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809054408/http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/corporalpunishment/pdf/EnglishQuestionAnswer_en.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}

===Children's reactions===

Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, referring to the UN Study on Violence Against Children, commented that "Throughout the study process, children have consistently expressed the urgent need to stop all this violence. Children testify to the hurt&amp;mdash;not only physical, but ‘the hurt inside’&amp;mdash;which this violence causes them, compounded by adult acceptance, even approval of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--Full citation elsewhere in text--&gt; |title=Abolishing corporal punishment of children: Questions and answers |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/corporalpunishment/pdf/EnglishQuestionAnswer_en.pdf |page=31
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bernadette Saunders of [[Monash University]], "Children commonly tell us that physical punishment hurts them physically and can escalate in severity; arouses negative emotions, such as resentment, confusion, sadness, hatred, humiliation, and anger; creates fear and impedes learning; is not constructive, children prefer reasoning; and it perpetuates violence as a means of resolving conflict. Children's comments suggest that children are sensitive to inequality and double standards, and children urge us to respect children and to act responsibly".&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saunders | first1 = B.

When children aged between five and seven in the [[United Kingdom]] were asked to describe being smacked by parents, their responses included such remarks as, "it feels like someone banged you with a hammer", "it hurts and it’s painful inside&amp;mdash;it’s like breaking your bones", and "it just feels horrid, you
know, and it really hurts, it stings you and makes you horrible inside".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willow |first1=Carolyne |last2=Hyder |first2=Tina |date=1998 |title=It Hurts You Inside: Children talking about smacking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgj3V4pTG-EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=National Children's Bureau |location=London |pages=46, 47 |isbn=1905818610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gershoff writes that "The pain and distress evident in these first-hand accounts can accumulate over time and precipitate the mental-health problems that have been linked with corporal punishment".&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt; Other comments by children such as, "you [feel] sort of as though you want to run away because they’re sort of like being mean to you and it hurts a lot" and "you feel you don’t like your parents anymore" are consistent with researchers' concerns that corporal punishment can undermine the quality of parent-child relationships, according to Gershoff.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt;

== Relationship to child abuse ==

Overlapping definitions of [[physical abuse]] and physical punishment of children highlight a subtle or non-existent distinction between abuse and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Saunders, Bernadette |author2=Goddard, Chris |date=2010 |title=Physical Punishment in Childhood: The Rights of the Child |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=2–3 |isbn=978-0-470-72706-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Durrant and Ron Ensom write that most physical abuse is physical punishment "in intent, form, and effect".&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt; Incidents of confirmed physical abuse often result from the use of corporal punishment for purposes of [[Child discipline|discipline]], for instance from parents' inability to control their anger or judge their own strength, or from not understanding children’s physical vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=SocialSciences&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html "Corporal Punishment"] (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]] of the [[United Kingdom]] remarked in a 2009 policy statement that "corporal punishment of children in the home is of importance to pediatricians because of its connection with child abuse... all pediatricians will have seen children who have been injured as a result of parental chastisement. It is not possible logically to differentiate between a smack and a physical assault since both are forms of violence. The motivation behind the smack cannot reduce the hurtful impact it has on the child."  They assert that preventing child maltreatment is of "vital importance", and advocate a change in the laws concerning corporal punishment.  In their words, "Societies which promote the needs and rights of children have a low incidence of child maltreatment, and this includes a societal rejection of physical punishment of children".&lt;ref name=RCPCH/&gt;

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "The only way to maintain the initial effect of spanking is to systematically increase the intensity with which it is delivered, which can quickly escalate into abuse". They note that "Parents who spank their children are more likely to use other unacceptable forms of corporal punishment".&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"/&gt;

In the United States, interviews with parents reveal that as many as two thirds of documented instances of physical abuse begin as acts of corporal punishment meant to correct a child's behavior.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt; In Canada, three quarters of substantiated cases of physical abuse of children have occurred within the context of physical punishment, according to the [[Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect]].&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt; According to Elizabeth Gershoff, "Both parental acts involve hitting, and purposefully hurting, children.  The difference between the two is often degree (duration, amount of force, object used) rather than intent".&lt;ref name=Gershoff2013&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gershoff |first=Elizabeth T. |date= September 2013 |title= Spanking and Child Development: We Know Enough Now to Stop Hitting Our Children |journal= Child Development Perspectives |publisher= The Society for Research in Child Development |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=133–137 |doi=10.1111/cdep.12038 |pmid=24039629 |pmc=3768154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 retrospective report study in New Zealand showed that physical punishment of children was quite common in the 1970s and 80s, with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents at some time during childhood.  Among this sample, 29% reported being hit with an empty hand, 45% with an object, and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse.  The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child's head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millichamp |first=Jane |author2=Martin J |author3=Langley  J |year=2006 |title=On the receiving end: young adults describe their parents' use of physical punishment and other disciplinary measures during childhood |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=119 |issue=1228 |pmid=16462926 |page= U1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diana Baumrind]] and colleagues argued in a 2002 paper that parents who are easily frustrated or inclined toward [[controlling behavior]] "should not spank", but that existing research did not support a "blanket injunction" against spanking.&lt;ref name="Baumrind Larzelere Cowan 2002"/&gt;  Gershoff characterized Baumrind et al.'s solution as unrealistic, since it would require potentially abusive parents to monitor themselves.  She argues that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] should be high for advocates of corporal punishment as a disciplinary strategy, asserting that "unless and until researchers, clinicians, and parents can definitively demonstrate the presence of [beneficial] effects of corporal punishment [and] not just the absence of negative effects, we as psychologists cannot responsibly recommend its use".&lt;ref name=Burden/&gt;

A 2008 study at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] found that mothers who reported spanking their children were three times more likely to also report using forms of punishment considered abusive to the researchers "such as beating, burning, kicking, hitting with an object somewhere other than the buttocks, or shaking a child less than 2 years old" than mothers who did not report spanking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Zolotor A.J. |author2=Theodore A.D. |author3=Chang J.J. |author4=Berkoff M.C. |author5=Runyan D.K. |title=Speak softly--and forget the stick.

Adam Zolotor, the study's lead author, noted that "increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse, and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object–such as a belt or a switch–are nine times more likely to report abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.unc.edu/www/newsarchive/2008/august/unc-study-shows-link-between-spanking-and-physical-abuse |title=UNC study shows link between spanking and physical abuse |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=19 August 2008 |publisher=UNC School of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study reported by Murray Straus in 2001 found that 40% of 111 mothers surveyed were worried that they could possibly hurt their children by using corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray, ''Beating the Devil out of Them: Corporal Punishment in American Families and Its Effects on Children.''

==Effects on behavior and development==

Numerous studies have found increased risk of impaired [[child development]] from the use of corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporal punishment by parents has been linked to increased [[aggression]], [[Mental illness|mental health problems]], impaired [[cognitive development]], and [[Substance abuse|drug and alcohol abuse]].&lt;ref name=RisksAlternatives/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt; Many of these results are based on large [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] controlling for various confounding factors.  Joan Durrant and Ron Ensom write that "Together, results consistently suggest that physical punishment has a direct causal effect on externalizing behavior, whether through a reflexive response to pain, modeling, or coercive family processes".&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt; No peer-reviewed research has shown improvements in developmental health as a result of parents' use of corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt; [[Randomized controlled trial]]s, the benchmark for establishing causality, are not commonly used for studying physical punishment because of ethical constraints against deliberately causing pain to study participants.  However, one existing randomized controlled trial did demonstrate that a {{em|1=reduction}} in harsh physical punishment was followed by a significant drop in children's aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt;

The few existing [[randomized controlled trials]] used to investigate physical punishment have shown that it is not more effective than other methods in eliciting children's [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]].&lt;ref name="Lessons"/&gt; 
A 2002 [[meta-analysis]] indicated that spanking did increase children's immediate compliance with parents' commands.&lt;ref name="Gershoff review 2002"/&gt;  However, according to Gershoff, those findings were overly influenced by one study, which found a strong relationship but had a small sample size (only sixteen children studied).&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt; A later analysis found that spanking children was not more effective than giving children [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]]s in eliciting immediate  compliance, and that spanking led to a reduction in long‑term compliance.&lt;ref name="Gershoff2013"/&gt;

Gershoff suggests that corporal punishment may actually decrease a child's "moral internalization" of positive values.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010/&gt; According to research, corporal punishment of children predicts weaker internalization of values such as empathy, altruism and resistance to temptation.&lt;ref name=Professionals/&gt; According to Joan Durrant, it should therefore not be surprising that corporal punishment "consistently predicts increased levels of antisocial behavior in children, including aggression against siblings, peers, and parents, as well as dating violence".&lt;ref name=Professionals&gt;{{cite journal |author=Durrant, Joan |title=Physical Punishment, Culture, and Rights: Current Issues for Professionals |date=March 2008 |journal=Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=55–66 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5551171_Physical_Punishment_Culture_and_Rights_Current_Issues_for_Professionals |pmid=18300726 |doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e318135448a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining several longitudinal studies that investigated the path from spanking to aggression in children from [[preschool]] age through [[adolescence]], Gershoff concluded: "In none of these longitudinal studies did spanking predict reductions in children’s aggression [...] Spanking consistently predicted increases in children’s aggression over time, regardless of how aggressive children were when the spanking occurred".&lt;ref name=Gershoff2013/&gt; A 2010 study at [[Tulane University]] found a 50% greater risk of aggressive behavior two years later in young children who were spanked more than twice in the month before the study began.&lt;ref name="Taylor-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Taylor | first1 = CA. | last2 = Manganello | first2 = JA. | last3 = Lee | first3 = SJ. | last4 = Rice | first4 = JC. | title = Mothers' spanking of 3-year-old children and subsequent risk of children's aggressive behavior | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = e1057–65 |date=May 2010 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2009-2678 | pmid = 20385647 | pmc=5094178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study controlled for a wide variety of confounding variables, including initial levels of aggression in the children.  According to the study's leader, Catherine Taylor, this suggests that "it's not just that children who are more aggressive are more likely to be spanked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1983895,00.html |title=The Long-Term Effects of Spanking |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location =New York |date=3 May 2010 |author=Park, Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 [[Meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] review by Gershoff that combined 60 years of research on corporal punishment found that corporal punishment was linked with nine negative outcomes in children, including increased rates of aggression, delinquency, mental health problems, problems in relationships with parents, and likelihood of being physically abused.&lt;ref name="Gershoff review 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gershoff E.T.

According to Gershoff, the Conflict Tactics Scale is "the closest thing to a standard measure of corporal punishment".&lt;ref name=Burden&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gershoff |first=Elizabeth T. |date=2002 |title=Corporal Punishment, Physical Abuse, and the Burden of Proof: Reply to Baumrind, Larzelere, and Cowan (2002), Holden (2002), and Parke (2002) |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1284602.pdf&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHJLFdgYZbzalJCdv9tA7eySz4zw&amp;sig2=cGh53XCncRUPDGiO_A0hPg |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Pschological Association |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=602–611 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study at the [[University of Manitoba]] indicated that people who reported being "pushed, grabbed, shoved, slapped or hit" even "sometimes" as children suffered more [[mood disorder]]s, such as depression, anxiety, and mania, along with more [[Substance abuse|dependence on drugs]] or [[alcoholism|alcohol]] in adulthood.  Those who reported experiencing "severe physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, or exposure to intimate partner violence" were not included in the results.  According to the researchers, the findings "provide evidence that harsh physical punishment independent of child maltreatment is related to mental disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/spanking-kids-leads-adult-mental-illnesses/story?id=16695697 |title=Spanking Kids Leads to Adult Mental Illnesses |last=Smith |first=Michael |date=2 July 2012 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier Canadian study gave similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Preliminary results from [[neuroimaging]] studies suggest that physical punishment may cause a reduction of [[grey matter]] in brain areas associated with performance on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]], as well as certain alterations to brain regions which secrete or are sensitive to the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], linked with a risk of drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt;

Corporal punishment also has links with [[domestic violence]]. According to Gershoff, research indicates that the more corporal punishment children receive, the more likely they are as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners.&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt;

A 2013 [[meta-analysis|meta&amp;#8209;analysis]] by Dr. Chris Ferguson employed an alternative statistical analysis that still showed negative outcomes in children subjected to spanking and corporal punishment, but found the overall relationship to be "trivial" or nearly so. However, Ferguson acknowledged this still indicates harmful outcomes and noted some limitations of his analysis, stating "On the other hand, there was no evidence from the current meta-analysis to indicate that spanking or CP held any particular advantages. There appears, from the current data, to be no reason to believe that spanking/CP holds any benefits related to the current outcomes, in comparison to other forms of discipline."&lt;ref name="Ferguson -2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ferguson | first1 = C.

== Statements by professional associations ==

The pediatric division of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] has urged that physical punishment of children be outlawed in Australia, stating that is a violation of children's human rights to exempt them from protection against physical assault. They urge support for parents to use "more effective, non-violent methods of discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Cassie |date=29 August 2013 |title=Why doctors are telling us not to smack our children |url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2013/08/29/3836505.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Psychological Society]] holds that corporal punishment of children is an ineffective method of deterring unwanted behavior, promotes undesirable behaviors and fails to demonstrate an alternative desirable behavior.  They assert that corporal punishment often promotes further undesirable behaviors such as defiance and attachment to "delinquent" peer groups and encourages an acceptance of aggression and violence as acceptable responses to conflicts and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/lc/qalc.nsf/ad22cc96ba50555dca257051007aa5c8/ca25707400260aa3ca25706f0001d5c8!OpenDocument |title=Legislative assembly questions #0293 - Australian Psychological Society:  Punishment and Behaviour Change|accessdate=6 August 2008|date=30 October 1996|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Canadian Paediatric Society]], "The research that is available supports the position that spanking and other forms of physical punishment are associated with negative child outcomes.  The Canadian Paediatric Society, therefore, recommends that physicians strongly discourage disciplinary spanking and all other forms of physical punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/pp/pp04-01.htm#Forms%20of%20discipline|title=Effective discipline for children|author1=Psychosocial Paediatrics Committee |author2=Canadian Paediatric Society |journal=Paediatrics &amp; Child Health|year=2004|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–41|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]] of the United Kingdom opposes corporal punishment of children in all circumstances, stating that "it is never appropriate to hit or beat children".&lt;ref name="pmid12949335"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynch M.

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) has stated that "Corporal punishment is of limited effectiveness and has potentially deleterious side effects". They recommend that parents be "encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing undesired behavior". In particular, the AAP believes that any corporal punishment methods other than open-hand spanking on the buttocks or extremities, including striking with an object, striking which leaves marks lasting longer than a few minutes, pulling by the hair, jerking a child's arm and shaking a child, "should never be used".

In the AAP's opinion, such punishments, as well as "physical punishment delivered in anger with intent to cause pain", are "unacceptable and may be dangerous to the health and well-being of the child." They also point out that "The more children are spanked, the more anger they report as adults, the more likely they are to spank their own children, the more likely they are to approve of hitting a spouse, and the more marital conflict they experience as adults" and that "spanking has been associated with higher rates of physical aggression, more substance abuse, and increased risk of crime and violence when used with older children and adolescents".&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health

The AAP believes that corporal punishment polarizes the parent-child relationship, reducing the amount of spontaneous cooperation on the part of the child.  In their words, "[R]eliance on spanking as a discipline approach makes other discipline strategies less effective to use".  The AAP believes that spanking as a form of discipline can easily lead to [[child abuse|abuse]], noting also that spanking children younger than 18 months of age increases the chance of physical injury.&lt;ref name="pmid9521967"/&gt;

== Children's rights ==

Paulo Pinheiro asserts that "The [UN study] should mark a turning point—an end to adult justification of violence against children, whether accepted as 'tradition' or disguised as 'discipline' [...] Children’s uniqueness—their potential and vulnerability, their dependence on adults—makes it imperative that they have more, not less, protection from violence".&lt;ref name=Pinheiro1&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--Full citation elsewhere in text--&gt; |title=Abolishing corporal punishment of children: Questions and answers |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/corporalpunishment/pdf/EnglishQuestionAnswer_en.pdf |page=16 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report to the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] recommends prohibition of all forms of violence against children, including corporal punishment in the family and other settings.&lt;ref name=Pinheiro1/&gt;

The [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] remarked in 2006 that all forms of corporal punishment, along with non-physical punishment which "belittles, humiliates, denigrates, scapegoats, threatens, scares or ridicules" children were found to be "cruel and degrading" and therefore incompatible with the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. In the Committee's view, "Addressing the widespread acceptance or tolerance of corporal punishment of children and eliminating it, in the family, schools and other settings, is not only an obligation of States parties under the Convention. It is also a key strategy for reducing and preventing all forms of violence in societies".&lt;ref name=UNCommittee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/460bc7772.html |title= General comment No. 8 (2006): The right of the child to protection from corporal punishment and or cruel or degrading forms of punishment (articles 1, 28(2), and 37, inter alia) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2 March 2007 |publisher= United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, 42nd Sess., U.N.

The Committee on the Rights of the Child advocates legal reform banning corporal punishment that is educational rather than punitive:

{{quote |The first purpose of law reform to prohibit corporal punishment of children within the family is prevention: to prevent violence against children by changing attitudes and practice, underlining children’s right to equal protection and providing an unambiguous foundation for child protection and for the promotion of positive, non-violent and participatory forms of child-rearing [...] While all reports of violence against children should be appropriately investigated and their protection from significant harm assured, the aim should be to stop parents from using violent or other cruel or degrading punishments through supportive and educational, not punitive, interventions.&lt;ref name=UNCommittee/&gt;}}

The office of Europe's [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] notes that the defence of "reasonable chastisement" is based on the view that children are property, equating it with former legal rights of husbands to beat wives and masters to beat servants. The Commissioner stresses that human rights, including the right to physical integrity, are the primary consideration in advocating an end to corporal punishment:

{{quote |The imperative for removing adults’ assumed rights to hit children is that of human rights principles. It should therefore not be necessary to prove that alternative and positive means of socializing children are more effective. However, research into the harmful physical and psychological effects of corporal punishment in childhood and later life and into the links with other forms of violence do indeed add further compelling arguments for banning the practice and thereby breaking the cycle of violence.&lt;ref name="Commissioner Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web |author=Commissioner for Human Rights |title=Children and corporal punishment: 'The right not to be hit, also a children's right' |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1237635 |website=coe.int |publisher=Council of Europe |date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] maintains that corporal punishment is a breach of children's "fundamental right to human dignity and physical integrity", and violates children's "equally fundamental right to the same legal protection as adults". The Assembly urges a total ban on "all forms of corporal punishment and any other forms of degrading punishment or treatment of children" as a requirement of the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref name=Parliamentary/&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has found corporal punishment to be a violation of children's rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], stating that bans on corporal punishment did not violate religious freedom or the right to private or family life.&lt;ref name=Parliamentary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=17235&amp;lang=en |title=Recommendation 1666 (2004): Europe-Wide Ban on Corporal Punishment of Children |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 June 2004 |publisher= Parliamentary Assembly, Council of Europe (21st Sitting) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] concluded in 2009 that corporal punishment "constitutes a form of violence against children that wounds their dignity and hence their human rights", asserting that "the member states of the Organization of American States are obliged to guarantee children and adolescents special protection against the use of corporal punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/Ninez/CastigoCorporal2009/CASTIGO%20CORPORAL%20ENGLISH%20FINAL.pdf |format= PDF |title= Report on Corporal Punishment and Human Rights of Children and Adolescents |date=5 August 2009 |page= 38 |publisher= Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Rapporteurship on the Rights of the Child, Organization of American States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] also recommends that corporal punishment be prohibited in schools, homes and institutions as a form of discipline, and contends that it is a violation of human rights as well as counterproductive, ineffective, dangerous and harmful to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stuart N. |last=Hart |title=Eliminating Corporal Punishment: The Way Forward to Constructive Child Discipline |series=Education on the move |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |location=Paris |year=2005 |pages=64–71 |isbn=92-3-103991-1 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swedish ban ==

Sweden was the world's first nation to outlaw all forms of corporal punishment of children. In 1957, the section permitting parents to use force in reprimanding their children (as long as it did not cause any severe injury) was completely removed from the Penal Code. The intent of this change was to provide children with the same protection from assault that adults receive and to clarify the grounds for criminal prosecution of parents who abused their children. However, parents' right to use corporal punishment of their children was not completely eliminated, but parents might use mild forms of physical discipline that would not constitute assault under the Penal Code, until 1966 when the section permitting parents to use it was removed and fully replaced by the constitution of assault under the Penal Code.&lt;ref name="Durrant 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Joan E. |editor1=Frehsee, Detlev |editor2=etal |title=Family Violence Against Children: A Challenge for Society |date=1996 |location=Berlin |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=3-11-014996-6 |page=20 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Family_Violence_Against_Children.html?id=8IyJkWAAXjkC&amp;q=%22swedish+ban+on+corporal+punishment%22 |chapter=The Swedish Ban on Corporal Punishment:  Its History and Effects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though parents' right to use corporal punishment of their children was no longer supported by law, many parents believed the law allowed it. Therefore, it was necessary with a more clear law which supported children's rights and protected children from violence or other humiliating treatment. On 1 July 1979, Sweden became the world's first nation to explicitly ban corporal punishment of children through an amendment to the Parenthood and Guardianship Code which stated:

Some critics in the [[Swedish Parliament]] predicted that the amendment would lead to a large-scale criminalization of Swedish parents. Others asserted that the law contradicted the Christian faith. Despite these objections, the law received almost unanimous support in Parliament. The law was accompanied by a public education campaign by the Swedish Ministry of Justice, including brochures distributed to all households with children, as well as informational posters and notices printed on milk cartons.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|p=13}}

In 1982, a group of Swedish parents brought a complaint to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] asserting that the ban on parental physical punishment breached their right to respect for family life and religious freedom; the complaint was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Seven Individuals v Sweden, European Commission of Human Rights, Admissibility Decision, 13 May 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Swedish Institute]], "Until the 1960s, nine out of ten [[preschool]] children in Sweden were spanked at home. Slowly, though, more and more parents voluntarily refrained from its use and corporal punishment was prohibited throughout the educational system in 1958". {{as of|2014}}, approximately 5 percent of Swedish children are spanked illegally.&lt;ref name=Banned1979&gt;{{cite web |title=First Ban on Smacking Children |url=https://sweden.se/society/smacking-banned-since-1979/ |publisher=Swedish Institute |date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, professionals working directly with children are obliged to report any suggestion of maltreatment to social services. Allegations of assault against children are frequently handled in special "children's houses", which combine the efforts of police, prosecutors, social services, forensic scientists and child psychologists. The Children and Parents Code does not itself impose penalties for smacking children, but instances of corporal punishment that meet the criteria of assault may be prosecuted.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|pp=14–15}}

From the 1960s to the 2000s, there was a steady decline in the numbers of parents who use physical punishment as well as those who believe in its use. In the 1960s, more than 90 percent of Swedish parents reported using physical punishment, even though only approximately 55 percent supported its use. By the 2000s, the gap between belief and practice had nearly disappeared, with slightly more than 10 percent of parents reporting that they use corporal punishment. In 1994, the first year that Swedish children were asked to report their experiences of corporal punishment, 35 percent said they had been smacked at some point. According to the Swedish [[Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry of Health and Social Affairs]], this number was considerably lower after the year 2000. Interviews with parents also revealed a sharp decline in more severe forms of punishment, such as punching or the use of objects to hit children, which are likely to cause injury.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|pp=16–17}}

The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and [[Save the Children]] ascribe these changes to a number of factors, including the development of Sweden's welfare system; greater equality between the sexes and generations than elsewhere in the world; the large number of children attending daycare centers, which facilitate the identification of children being mistreated; and efforts by neonatal and children's medical clinics to reduce family violence.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|pp=17–18}}

While cases of suspected assault on children have risen since the early 1980s, this rise can be attributed to an increase in reporting due to reduced tolerance of violence against children, rather than an increase in actual assaults. Since the 1979 ban on physical punishment, the percentage of reported assaults that result in prosecution has not increased; however, Swedish social services investigate all such allegations and provide supportive measures to the family where needed.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|p=18}}
 
According to Joan Durrant, the ban on corporal punishment was intended to be "educational rather than punitive".&lt;ref name="Durrant 2000"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Durrant |first=Joan E. |title=A Generation Without Smacking: The impact of Sweden's ban on physical punishment |date=2000 |publisher=Save the Children |location=London |page=6 |url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/documents/4616.pdf |isbn=1-84-187019-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1979 change to the Parenthood and Guardianship Code, there was no increase in the number of children removed from their families; in fact, the number of children entering state care significantly decreased. There have also been more social-service interventions done with parental consent and fewer compulsory interventions.{{sfnp|Durrant|2000|p=6}} Durrant writes that the authorities had three goals, namely: to bring about a change in public attitudes away from support for corporal punishment, to facilitate the identification of children likely to be physically abused, and to enable earlier intervention in families with the intention of supporting, rather than punishing, parents. According to Durrant, data from various official sources in Sweden show that these goals are being met.{{sfnp|Durrant|2000|p=27}} She writes:

{{Quote |Since 1981, reports of assaults against children in Sweden have increased—as they have worldwide, following the 'discovery' of child abuse.  However, the proportion of suspects who are in their twenties, and therefore raised in a no-smacking culture, has decreased since 1984, as has the proportion born in the Nordic nations with corporal punishment bans.{{sfnp|Durrant|2000|p=6}}}}

Contrary to expectations of an increase of [[juvenile delinquency]] following the ban of corporal punishment, youth crime remained steady while [[theft]] convictions and suspects in [[narcotics]] crimes among Swedish youth significantly decreased; youth drug and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] use and youth [[suicide]] also decreased. Durrant writes: "While drawing a direct causal link between the corporal punishment ban and any of these social trends would be too simplistic, the evidence presented here indicates that the ban has not had negative effects".{{sfnp|Durrant|2000|p=6}}

Further research has shown no sign of a rise in crimes by young people. From the mid-1990s into the 2000s, youth crime decreased, primarily owing to fewer instances of theft and vandalism, while violent crime remained constant. Most young people in Sweden who commit offences do not become habitual criminals, according to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.{{sfnp|Modig|2009|p=22}} While there has been an increase in reports of assaults by youth against others of similar age, official sources indicate that the increase has been largely due to a "zero-tolerance" approach to [[school bullying]] resulting in increased reporting, rather than an increase in actual assaults.&lt;ref name=Phoenix/&gt;{{sfnp|Durrant|2000|p=27}}

[[File:Poster of Azerbaijan 1938. Constitutions.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet Poster featuring Stalin, [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]], 1938]] 

A '''cult of personality''' arises when a country's regime &amp;ndash; or, more rarely, an individual &amp;ndash; uses the techniques of [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], the [[big lie]], [[spectacle]], [[the arts]], [[patriotism]], and [[government-organized demonstration]]s and rallies to create an idealized, heroic, and worshipful image of a leader, often through unquestioning [[flattery]] and [[praise]].  A cult of personality is similar to [[apotheosis]], except that it is established by modern [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering techniques]], usually by the state or the party in [[one-party state]]s. It is often seen in [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] countries. 

The term came to prominence in 1956, in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s secret speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'', given on the final day of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].  In the speech, Khrushchev, who was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary of the Communist Party]] &amp;ndash; in effect, the leader of the country &amp;ndash; criticized the [[Stalin's cult of personality|lionization and idealization]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], and, by implication, his Communist contemporary [[Mao Zedong]], as being [[Revisionism (Marxism)|contrary]] to [[Marxism|Marxist doctrine]].  The speech was later made public and was part of the "[[de-Stalinization]]" process the Soviet Union went through.

==Background==
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Augustus of Prima Porta]], 1st century AD]]
{{See also|Imperial cult}}
The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified [[emperors]] and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority ([[auctoritas]]) of the [[Roman State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Imperial cult of ancient Rome|date=2018-08-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperial_cult_of_ancient_Rome&amp;oldid=854819458|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, [[monarch]]s and other [[Head of state|heads of state]] were often held in enormous reverence and imputed super-human qualities. Through the principle of the [[divine right of kings]], in medieval Europe for example, rulers were said to hold office by the will of [[God]]. [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Imperial Japan]], the [[Inca]], the [[Aztecs]], [[Tibet]], Siam (now [[Thailand]]), and the [[Roman Empire]] are especially noted for redefining monarchs as "god-kings".

The spread of democratic and secular ideas in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 18th and 19th centuries made it increasingly difficult for monarchs to preserve this aura. However, the subsequent development of [[mass media]], such as [[radio]], enabled political leaders to project a positive image of themselves onto the masses as never before. It was from these circumstances in the 20th century that the most notorious personality cults arose. Often these cults are a form of [[political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Plamper. The Stalin Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press. 2012. pp.13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cult of personality" probably appeared in English around 1800–1850, along with the French and German use.&lt;ref name="Heller2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Klaus|title=Personality Cults in Stalinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CreuLAI0c9sC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=7 September 2018|year=2004|publisher=Isd|isbn=978-3-89971-191-2|pages=23–33|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At first it had no political connotations but was instead closely related to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] "cult of genius".&lt;ref name="Heller2004"/&gt; The political use of the phrase came first in a letter from [[Karl Marx]] to German political worker, Wilhelm Blos, 10 November 1877:&lt;ref name="Heller2004"/&gt;

''Personenkultus''] that at the time of the International, when plagued by numerous moves [...] to accord me public honor, I never allowed one of these to enter the domain of publicity [...]&lt;ref name="Heller2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blos|first=Wilhelm|title=Brief von Karl Marx an Wilhelm Blos|url=http://www.zeno.org/nid/20003602281|website=Denkwürdigkeiten eines Sozialdemokraten|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Characteristics==
There are various views about what constitutes a cult of personality in a leader. Historian [[Jan Plamper]] has written that modern-day personality cults display five characteristics that set them apart from "their predecessors": The cults are secular and "anchored in popular sovereignty"; their objects are all males; they target the entire population, not only the well-to-do or just the ruling class; they use mass media; and they exist where the mass media can be controlled enough to inhibit the introduction of "rival cults".&lt;ref&gt;The Stain Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power. p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''What is character and why it really does matter'', Thomas A. Wright states, "The cult of personality phenomenon refers to the idealized, even god-like, public image of an individual consciously shaped and molded through constant propaganda and media exposure. As a result, one is able to manipulate others based entirely on the influence of public personality...the cult of personality perspective focuses on the often shallow, external images that many public figures cultivate to create an idealized and heroic image."&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"&gt;What is character and why it really does matter. p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Teodor Popan defines cult of personality as a "quantitatively exaggerated and qualitatively extravagant public demonstration of praise of the leader". He also identifies three causal "necessary, but not sufficient, structural conditions, and a path dependent chain of events which, together, lead to the cult formation: a particular combination of patrimonialism and clientelism, lack of dissidence, and systematic falsification pervading the society’s culture."&lt;ref&gt;See Adrian Teodor Popan, ''The ABC of Sycophancy. Structural Conditions for the Emergence of Dictators’ Cults of Personality'' (PhD dissertation U of Texas 2015). Bibliography pp 196-213.[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf  online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The ABC of sycophancy : structural conditions for the emergence of dictators' cults of personality |date=August 2015 |doi=10.15781/T2J960G15 |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en |id=|hdl=2152/46763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the media==
The media has played an instrumental role in forging national leaders' cults of personality.

Thomas A. Wright reports that "It is becoming evident that the charismatic leader, especially in politics, has increasingly become the product of media and self-exposure."&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"/&gt; And, focusing on the media in the United States, Robert N. Bellah adds that, "It is hard to determine the extent to which the media reflect the cult of personality in American politics and to what extent they have created it. Surely they did not create it all alone, but just as surely they have contributed to it. In any case, American politics is dominated by the personalities of political leaders to an extent rare in the modern world...in the personalised politics of recent years the "charisma" of the leader may be almost entirely a product of media exposure."&lt;ref&gt;California Law Review. p.747&lt;/ref&gt;

Enjoying repeated electoral success; particularly his third election victory in 2008, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], an Italian [[media proprietor|media tycoon]] and politician who served as Prime Minister of Italy in four governments, was the most controversial head of government in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial Politics, Populism and 'post-fascism' Carlo Ruzza, Stefano Fella, Political Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuzzaFella2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruzza|first1=Carlo|last2=Fella|first2=Stefano|title=Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial Politics, Populism and 'post-fascism'|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4cVgOb7fsNcC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=berlusconi+populism+media&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5ihaT7fOHKSt0QWqyoXmDQ&amp;redir_esc=y%23v=onepage&amp;q=berlusconi%20populism%20media&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2018|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34461-6|pages=227–|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the controlling shareholder of [[Mediaset]] and owned the [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club [[A.C. Milan]] from 1986 to 2017. [[Forbes]] magazine ranked him 12th in the [[Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People|List of The World's Most Powerful People]] due to his domination of [[Politics of Italy|Italian politics]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_Silvio-Berlusconi_9SKC.html |work=Forbes |title=#12 Silvio Berlusconi |date=11 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111021540/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_Silvio-Berlusconi_9SKC.html |archivedate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Often, a single leader became associated with this revolutionary transformation and came to be treated as a benevolent "guide" for the nation without whom the transformation to a better future could not occur. This has been generally the justification for personality cults that arose in totalitarian societies, such as those of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong]]. Jan Plamper argues while [[Napoleon III]] made some innovations it was  [[Benito Mussolini]] in  Italy in the 1920s who originated the model of dictator-as-cult-figure that was emulated  by Hitler, Stalin and the others, using the propaganda powers of a totalitarian state.&lt;ref&gt; Jan Plamper, ''The Stalin Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power'' (Yale UP, 2012), pp 4, 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre du Bois argues that the Stalin cult was elaborately constructed to legitimize his rule. Many deliberate distortions and falsehoods were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=du Bois |first1=Pierre |title=Stalin – Genesis of a Myth |journal=Survey.

Photographs were altered and  documents were invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strong |first1=Carol |last2=Killingsworth |first2=Matt |title=Stalin the Charismatic Leader?: Explaining the 'Cult of Personality' as a legitimation technique |journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology |date=2011 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=391–411 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who knew Stalin were forced to provide  "official" accounts to meet the ideological demands of the cult, especially as Stalin himself presented it in 1938 in ''[[the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)|Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] '', which became the official history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maslov |first1=N.

Historian [[David L. Hoffmann]] states "The Stalin cult was a central element of [[Stalinism]], and as such it was one of the most salient features of Soviet rule...Many scholars of Stalinism cite the cult as integral to Stalin's power or as evidence of Stalin's megalomania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffmann |first1=David L. |title=The Stalin Cult |journal=The Historian |date=2013 |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=909 |accessdate=7 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The American band [[Living Colour]] won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 1990 for their song "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0hYpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=woQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6625,4056376&amp;dq ''Here's List of Nominees from all 77 Categories.''] [[The Deseret News]]. Salt Lake City, Utah. 12 January 1990. page W7. Accessed 8 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The song includes references to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Malcolm X]].

'''Decarcerate PA''' is a [[grassroots]], all-volunteer coalition seeking to challenge mass [[incarceration]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. Decarcerate PA's platform (No New Prisons, Decarceration, Community Reinvestment) has been endorsed by almost 100 organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mar 29 2014 - 9:00am |url=http://decarceratepa.info/decarcerate-pa-platform |title=Decarcerate PA Platform &amp;#124; Decarcerate PA |publisher=Decarceratepa.info |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decarcerate PA is an intentionally democratic organization that follows a [[ACT UP#Structure of ACT UP|committee structure]], with each committee dedicated to separate tasks.

Since Arafat's death, factionalism within the ideologically diverse movement has become more apparent.

In the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 election for the PLC]], the party lost its majority in the PLC to [[Hamas]]. However, the Hamas legislative victory led to a [[Fatah–Hamas conflict|conflict between Fatah and Hamas]], with Fatah retaining control of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in the [[West Bank]] through its President.

==Etymology==
The full name of the movement is حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني '''''ḥa'''rakat al-'''ta'''ḥrīr al-waṭanī al-'''F'''ilasṭīnī'', meaning the "Palestinian National Liberation Movement". From this was crafted the [[Backronym|reverse acronym]] ''Fatḥ'' (''Fatah'') meaning "opening", "conquering", or "victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033809|title=Fatah|quote=Fatah&amp;nbsp;[...] inverted acronym of Harakat al-Tahrir al-Watani al-Filastini&amp;nbsp;[...]|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129222152/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033809|archive-date=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "fatḥ" or "fatah" is used in religious discourse to signify the [[History of Islam#The spread of Islam|Islamic expansion]] in the first centuries of Islamic history&amp;nbsp;–as in ''Fatḥ [[Syria (region)|al-Sham]]'', the "conquering of the [[Levant]]". "Fatah" also has religious significance in that it is the name of the [[Al-Fath|48th ''sura'' (chapter)]] of the [[Quran]] which, according to major Muslim commentators, details the story of the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]]. (During the peaceful two years after the Hudaybiyyah treaty, many converted to Islam, increasing the strength of the Muslim side. It was the breach of this treaty by the [[Quraysh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, P.J. Bearman|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume X (Tā'-U[..])|year=2000|publisher=Brill|page=539|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; that triggered the [[conquest of Mecca]]. This Islamic precedent was cited by Yasser Arafat as justification for his signing the [[Oslo Accords]] with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabic.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2074 |title=معهد واشنطن - معهد واشنطن لسياسة الشرق الأدنى |publisher=Arabic.washingtoninstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=1725 |title=Thursday, May 21, 1998 Arafat Again Calls Oslo Accords A Temporary Truce |publisher=IMRA |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
[[File:Yasser-arafat-1999.jpg|thumb|[[Yasser Arafat]] was the main founder of Fatah and led the movement until his death in 2004.]]
The Fatah movement, which espoused a Palestinian nationalist ideology in which [[Palestinians|Palestinian Arabs]] would be liberated by their own actions, was founded in 1959 by members of the [[Palestinian diaspora]]{{spaced ndash}}more specifically, principally by professionals working in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf States]] who had studied in [[Cairo]] or [[Beirut]] and had been refugees in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. The founders included [[Yasser Arafat]], then head of the [[General Union of Palestinian Students]] (GUPS) at [[Cairo University]]; [[Salah Khalaf]]; [[Khalil al-Wazir]]; and [[Khaled Yashruti]], then GUPS head in Beirut.&lt;ref name="Aburish"&gt;Said K. AbusrishAburish, Said K. (1998) ''Arafat, From Defender to Dictator''. New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, pp.41–90. {{ISBN|978-1-58234-049-4}}. {{OCLC|61189464}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–93===
Fatah became the dominant force in Palestinian politics after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.

Fatah joined the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in 1967. It was immediately allocated 33 of 105 seats in the [[Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO Executive Committee]]. Founder Yasser Arafat became [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Chairman of the PLO]] in 1969, after the position was ceded to him by [[Yahya Hammuda]].&lt;ref name="Aburish"/&gt; According to the [[BBC]], "Mr Arafat took over as chairman of the executive committee of the PLO in 1969, a year that Fatah is recorded to have carried out 2,432 [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/profiles/1371998.stm|title=Fatah: Political heavyweight floored|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 January 2007|date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Karameh====
{{main|Battle of Karameh}}
Throughout 1968, Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) operation in the Jordanian village of [[Karameh]], where the Fatah headquarters{{spaced ndash}}as well as a mid-sized [[Palestinian refugees|Palestinian refugee camp]]{{spaced ndash}}were located. The town's name is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "dignity", which elevated its [[symbol]]ism to the Arab people, especially after the Arab defeat in 1967. The operation was in response to attacks against Israel, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias into the occupied West Bank. Knowledge of the operation was available well ahead of time, and the government of Jordan (as well as a number of Fatah commandos) informed Arafat of Israel's large-scale military preparations. Upon hearing the news, many guerrilla groups in the area, including George Habash's newly formed group the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and [[Nayef Hawatmeh]]'s breakaway organization the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), withdrew their forces from the town. Fatah leaders were advised by a pro-Fatah Jordanian divisional commander to withdraw their men and headquarters to nearby hills, but on Arafat's orders, Fatah remained, and the [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordanian Army]] agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued.&lt;ref name="Aburish"/&gt;

On the night of 21 March, the IDF attacked Karameh with heavy weaponry, armored vehicles and fighter jets.&lt;ref name="Aburish"/&gt; Fatah held its ground, surprising the Israeli military. As Israel's forces intensified their campaign, the Jordanian Army became involved, causing the Israelis to retreat in order to avoid a full-scale war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulloch|first=John|title=Final Conflict|year=1983|publisher=Faber Publishing|page=165|isbn=978-0-7126-0171-9|oclc=9803075}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the battle, nearly 150 Fatah militants had been killed, as well as twenty Jordanian soldiers and twenty-eight Israeli soldiers. Despite the higher Arab death toll, Fatah considered themselves victorious because of the Israeli army's rapid withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Aburish"/&gt;

====Black September====
{{further|Black September}}
In the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Arab resistance elements had created a virtual ''"state within a state"'' in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes – all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Sayigh, Yezid (1997). Armed Struggle and the Search for State, the Palestinian National Movement, 1949–1993. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-829643-0}}. {{OCLC|185547145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black September"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aburish |first=Said K.|authorlink=Said K. Aburish|title=From Defender to Dictator|year=1998|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=100–112|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58234-049-4|oclc=61189464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the Jordanian government moved to regain control over its territory, and the next day, King Hussein declared [[martial law]].&lt;ref name="Black September" /&gt; By 25 September, the Jordanian army achieved dominance in the fighting, and two days later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a series of ceasefires. The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties upon the Palestinians – including civilians – who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. Two thousand Fatah fighters managed to enter [[Syria]]. They crossed the border into Lebanon to join Fatah forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters. A large group of guerrilla fighters led by Fatah field commander [[Abu Ali Iyad]] held out the Jordanian Army's offensive in the northern city of [[Ajloun|Ajlun]] until they were decisively defeated in July 1971. Abu Ali Iyad was executed and surviving members of his commando force formed the [[Black September Organization]], a splinter group of Fatah. In November 1971, the group assassinated Jordanian prime minister [[Wasfi al-Tal]] as retaliation to Abu Ali Iyad's execution.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, 1992, pp.81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and the 1970s, Fatah provided training to a wide range of European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African militant and insurgent groups, and carried out numerous attacks against Israeli targets in Western Europe and the Middle East during the 1970s. Some militant groups that affiliated themselves to Fatah, and some of the ''fedayeen'' within Fatah itself, carried out civilian-[[aircraft hijacking]]s and terrorist attacks, attributing them to Black September, [[Abu Nidal]]'s [[Abu Nidal Organization|Fatah-Revolutionary Council]], [[Said al-Muragha|Abu Musa]]'s group, the PFLP, and the PFLP-GC. Fatah received weapons, explosives and training from the [[Soviet Union]] and some of the [[communist state]]s of [[East Europe]]. [[China]] and [[Algeria]] also provided munitions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

====Lebanon====
{{further|Lebanese Civil War}}
Since the death of [[Khalil al-Jamal|Eljamal]] in 1968, the Palestinian cause had a large base of supporters in Lebanon.

Although hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF), Fatah aligned itself with the communist and [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM). Although originally aligned with Fatah, [[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the [[Syria]]n-backed Palestinian factions of [[as-Sa'iqa]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command]] (PFLP-GC) led by [[Ahmed Jibril|Ahmad Jibril]] to fight alongside the Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary component of the Christian militias was the [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] [[Kataeb Party|Phalangists]].&lt;ref name="Lebanese Civil War"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aburish |first=Said K.|authorlink=Said K. Aburish|title=From Defender to Dictator|year=1998|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages=150–175|isbn=978-1-58234-049-4|oclc=61189464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phalangist forces killed twenty-six Fatah trainees on a bus in April 1975, marking the official start of the 15-year-long Lebanese civil war. Later that year, an alliance of Christian militias overran the Palestinian refugee camp of [[Karantina massacre|Karantina]] killing over 1,000 civilians.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=William |title=Faces of Lebanon. Sects, Wars, and Global Extensions|year=1996|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|pages=162–165|isbn=978-1-55876-115-5|oclc=34753518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of [[Damour massacre|Damour]], a Phalangist and Tigers (Ahrar) stronghold, killing 684 civilians.&lt;ref name="Lebanese Civil War"/&gt; As the civil war progressed over 2 years of urban warfare, both parties resorted to massive artillery duels and heavy use of sniper nests, while atrocities and war crimes were committed by both sides.

In 1976, with strategic planning help from the Lebanese Army, the alliance of Christian militias, spearheaded by the National Liberal Party of former President Cammille Chamoun militant branch, the noumour el ahrar (NLP Tigers), took a pivotal refugee camp in the Eastern part of Beirut, the Tel al-Zaatar camp, after a six-month siege, also known as [[Siege of Tel al-Zaatar|Tel al-Zaatar massacre]] in which hundreds perished.&lt;ref&gt;Disputed; in ''Faces of Lebanon. Sects, Wars, and Global Extensions'' pp.&amp;nbsp;162–165, William Harris states "Perhaps 3,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, died in the siege and its aftermath." [http://www.111101.net/facts/history/chronology/index.html?http://www.111101.net/facts/history/chronology/phase.php?year=1976 This source], however, states that 2,000 were killed; while [http://www.laa.org/tours/thewar.htm this page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020142835/http://www.laa.org/tours/thewar.htm |date=20 October 2013 }} suggests several thousand.&lt;/ref&gt; Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.&lt;ref name="Lebanese Civil War"/&gt;

PLO cross-border raids against Israel grew somewhat during the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One of the most severe{{spaced ndash}}known as the [[Coastal Road massacre]]{{spaced ndash}}occurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of [[Haifa]] with [[Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv-Yafo]]. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1977-1979/133%20Statement%20to%20the%20press%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin |title=133 Statement to the press by Prime Minister Begin on the massacre of Israelis on the Haifa – Tel Aviv Road- 12 March 1978|date=12 May 1978|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the IDF launched [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|Operation Litani]] three days later, with the goal of taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the [[Litani River]]. The IDF achieved this goal, and Fatah withdrew to the north into [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/819200.stm|title=Time Line: Lebanon Israel Controls South|work=BBC News|date=9 October 2007|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=BBC MMVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel [[1982 Lebanon War|invaded Lebanon again]] in 1982. Beirut was soon besieged and bombarded by the IDF;&lt;ref name="Lebanese Civil War"/&gt; to end the siege, the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and Fatah{{spaced ndash}}guarded by a multinational force{{spaced ndash}}to exile in [[Tunis]]. Despite the exile, many Fatah commanders and fighters remained in Lebanon, and they faced the [[War of the Camps]] in the 1980s in their fight with the Shia [[Amal Movement]] and also in connection with internal schisms within the Palestinian factions.&lt;ref name="Lebanese Civil War"/&gt;
&lt;!---The following recaps the above?:
When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, the faction was dispersed to several Middle Eastern countries with the help of US and other Western governments: [[Tunisia]], Yemen, [[Algeria]], Iraq and others. In the period 1982–1993, Fatah's leadership resided in [[Tunisia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
----&gt;

===After 1993===
====Presidential and legislative elections====
Until his death, Arafat was the head of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], the provisional entity created as a result of the Oslo Accords. [[Farouk Kaddoumi]] is the current Fatah chairman, elected to the post soon after Arafat's death in 2004.

Fatah nominated [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in the [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|Palestinian presidential election of 2005]].

In 2005, [[Hamas]] won in nearly all [[Palestinian local elections, 2004–2005|the municipalities it contested]]. Political analyst [[Salah Abdel-Shafi]] told the BBC about the difficulties of Fatah leadership: "I think it's very, very serious{{spaced ndash}}it's becoming obvious that they can't agree on anything." Fatah is "widely seen as being in desperate need of reform," as "the PA's performance has been a story of corruption and incompetence{{spaced ndash}}and Fatah has been tainted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4386355.stm|title=Fatah faces reform crossroads|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 January 2007|date=27 March 2005 |first=Alan |last=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal discord====
&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:Marwan-barghouti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marwan Barghouti]] is the founder of the [[Al-Mustaqbal (electoral list)|al-Mustaqbal]] political party and leader of the [[Tanzim]] and [[al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]] {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]]--&gt;
In December 2005, jailed [[Second Intifada|Intifada]] leader [[Marwan Barghouti]] broke ranks with the party and announced that he had formed a new political list to run in the elections called the ''[[Al-Mustaqbal (electoral list)|al-Mustaqbal]]'' ("The Future"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's "Young Guard." These younger leaders have repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party, which has been run by the "Old Guard" who returned from exile in [[Tunisia]] following the [[Oslo Accords]]. Al-Mustaqbal was to campaign against Fatah in the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]], presenting a list including [[Mohammed Dahlan]], [[Qadura Fares|Kadoura Fares]], Samir Mashharawi and [[Jibril Rajoub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1134309581046&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605010641/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1134309581046&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 June 2012|title=Fatah officials negotiate with Barghouti |publisher=Jerusalam Post |accessdate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 28 December 2005, the leadership of the two factions agreed to submit a single list to voters, headed by Barghouti, who began actively campaigning for Fatah from his jail cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reut-institute.org/Publication.aspx?PublicationId=1225|title=Crisis of Representation|publisher=Reut-institute.org|date=|accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/international/middleeast/15cnd-mide.html?ex=1168318800&amp;en=19dddb2093472ac9&amp;ei=5070|title=Main Palestinian Faction Splits Sharply Ahead of Election|work=New York Times|accessdate=7 January 2007|first=Steven|last=Erlanger|date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous other expressions of discontent within Fatah, which is just holding its first general congress in two decades. Because of this, the movement remains largely dominated by aging cadres from the pre-Oslo era of Palestinian politics. Several of them gained their positions through the patronage of Yasser Arafat, who balanced above the different factions, and the era after his death in 2004 has seen increased infighting among these groups, who jockey for influence over future development, the political line, funds, and constituencies. The prospect of Abbas leaving power in the coming years has also exacerbated tensions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

There have been no open splits within the older generation of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, [[Farouk Kaddoumi|Faruq al-Qaddumi]] (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and has intensified his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in [[Tunis]]. Since Arafat's death, he is formally head of Fatah's political bureau and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and [[Mohammed Dahlan]], but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, [[Hani al-Hassan]], has also openly criticized the present leadership.

Fatah's internal conflicts have also, due to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, merged with the turf wars between different PA security services, e.g., a longstanding rivalry between the West Bank ([[Jibril Rajoub]]) and Gaza (Muhammad Dahlan) branches of the powerful Preventive Security Service. Foreign backing for different factions contribute to conflict, e.g., with the United States generally seen as supportive of Abbas's overall leadership and of Dahlan's security influence, and Syria alleged to promote Faruq al-Qaddumi's challenge to the present leadership. The younger generations of Fatah, especially within the militant [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], have been more prone to splits, and a number of lesser networks in Gaza and the West Bank have established themselves as either independent organizations or joined Hamas. However, such overt breaks with the movement have still been rather uncommon, despite numerous rivalries inside and between competing local Fatah groups.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

====2009 6th General Assembly====
The Sixth General Assembly of the Fatah Movement began on 4 August 2009 in [[Bethlehem]], nearly 16 years after the [[Oslo I Accord]] and 20 years since the last Fatah convention, after being repeatedly postponed over conflicts ranging from who would be represented, to what venue would be acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708043824/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249275691810&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull editiorial.jpost.com Fatah's goals].

The internal dissension was immediately obvious.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] told Fatah delegates meeting in Bethlehem that divisions among the Palestinians were more damaging to their cause of an independent state than the Israeli "enemy".&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418529052&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706010736/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418529052&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 July 2013|title=Disputes break out at Fatah conference in Bethlehem|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatah delegates resolved not to resume [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Israeli-Palestinian peace talks]] until preconditions were met. Among the 14 preconditions were the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, freezing all [[Israeli settlement]] construction, and lifting the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|Gaza blockade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/EditionFrancaise/Home.aspxservlet/Satellite?cid=1249418545003&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120708225643/http://www.jpost.com/EditionFrancaise/Home.aspxservlet/Satellite?cid=1249418545003&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|deadurl=yes|title=Israel News - Online Israeli News Covering Israel &amp; The Jewish World …|date=8 July 2012|archivedate=8 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 400 Fatah members from the [[Gaza Strip]] were unable to attend the conference in [[Bethlehem]] after Hamas barred them from traveling to the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"/&gt;

Fatah was appealing to Palestinians who want a more hardline response to Israel by reaffirming its option for "armed resistance" against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25897575-15084,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912144608/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25897575-15084,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 September 2012|work=The Australian|first1=John|last1=Lyons|title=Israel to blame for Arafat death: Fatah|date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials on the third day of the Fatah convention in Bethlehem unanimously accepted the proposal put forth by the chairman of the Araft Institute stating that Israel had been behind the "assassination" of the late Palestinian Authority Chairman and affirmed Fatah's request for international aid to probe the issue. Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, [[Danny Ayalon]], said the conference was a "serious blow to peace" and "was another lost opportunity for the Palestinian leadership to adopt moderate views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Arafat-assassination-accusation-irks-Israel|work=Jerusalem Post|title=Arafat assassination accusation irks Israel|date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elections to Central Committee and Revolutionary Council====
On 9 August 2009, new members of the [[Central Committee of Fatah]] and the Revolutionary Council were chosen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=217680 ''Abdul-Rahim: Fatah conference 90 percent over'']. Ma'an News Agency, 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates voted to fill 18 seats on the 23-seat Central Committee, and 81 seats on the 128-seat Revolutionary Council after a week of deliberations. At least 70 new members entered the latter, with 20 seats going to Fatah representatives from the Gaza Strip, 11 seats filled by women (the highest number of votes went to one woman who spent years in Israeli jails for her role in the resistance), four seats went to Christians, and one was filled by a Jewish-born convert to Islam, [[Uri Davis]], the first Jewish-born person to be elected to the Revolutionary Council since its founding in 1958. Fatah activists from the [[Palestinian diaspora]] were also represented and included [[Samir Rifai]], Fatah's secretary in Syria, and Khaled Abu Usba.

Elected to the central council was Fadwa Barghouti, the wife of [[Marwan Barghouti]] who was serving five life sentences in Israel for his role in terrorist attacks on civilians in Israel during the [[Second Intifada]].

====Reconciliation process with Hamas====
{{main|Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process}}
A meeting of the Revolutionary Council was held in Ramallah from 18–19 October 2014. Many important questions were discussed, including reconciliation with Hamas. Opinion was divided on this issue.&lt;ref name=al-mon_growing_issues&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/10/fatah-revolutionary-council-meeting-hamas-dahlan.html ''Fatah's Revolutionary Council grapples with growing issues'']. Adnan Abu Amer, Al-Monitor, 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 7th Congress====
In December 2016, more than 1400 members of Fatah’s 7th Congress elected 18 members of the Central Committee and 80 for the Revolutionary Council. Six new members were added to the Central Committee while 12 were reelected. Outgoing members included Nabil Shaath, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Zakaria al-Agha and Tayib Abdul Rahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=hWTZzja51779170212ahWTZzj|title=Fatah Congress elects Central Committee and Revolutionary Council members|editor=WAFA|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Fatah has "Member Party" status at the [[Socialist International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticlePageID=1697|title=XXIV Congress of the Socialist International: Decisions on Membership}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has "Observer Party" status within the [[Party of European Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pes.eu/en/about-pes/pes-members/parties |title=PES member parties &amp;#124; PES |publisher=Pes.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503194245/http://www.pes.eu/en/about-pes/pes-members/parties |archivedate=3 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 1959 edition of Fatah's underground journal ''Filastinuna Nida al-Hayat'' indicated that the movement was motivated by the status of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab world:&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The youth of the catastrophe (''shibab al-nakba'') are dispersed... Life in the tent has become as miserable as death... [T]o die for our beloved Motherland is better and more honorable than life, which forces us to eat our daily bread under humiliations or to receive it as charity at the cost of our honour... We, the sons of the catastrophe, are no longer willing to live this dirty, despicable life, this life which has destroyed our cultural, moral and political existence and destroyed our human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;32.)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the beginning, the armed struggle{{spaced ndash}}as manifested in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] and the military role of Palestinian fighters under the leadership of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]{{spaced ndash}}was central to Fatah's ideology of liberating Palestine.&lt;ref name="Aburish"/&gt;

==Structure==
Fatah's two most important decision-making bodies are the [[Central Committee of Fatah|Central Committee]] and Revolutionary Council. The Central Committee is mainly an executive body, while the Revolutionary Council is Fatah's [[Legislature|legislative]] body.&lt;ref name=al-mon_growing_issues/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/12/content_11871601.htm Xinhua News Agency.

===Armed factions===
Fatah has maintained a number of militant groups since its founding. Its mainstream military branch is [[al-'Asifah]]. Fatah is generally considered to have had a strong involvement in terrorism in the past,&lt;ref name="Terrorism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Terrorism in Tel Aviv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Fatah Al-`Asifa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arafat's means’ failed in the end"/&gt; though unlike its rival [[Islamism|Islamist]] faction [[Hamas]], Fatah is no longer regarded as a terrorist organization by any government. Fatah used to be designated terrorist under [[Israel]]i law and was considered terrorist by the [[United States Department of State]] and [[United States Congress]] until it renounced terrorism in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/general/teror.asp|title=Israel ministry of Defense|publisher=Mod.gov.il|date=|accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kushner |first=Harvey W.|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|publisher=SAGE|year=2003|edition=illustrated|pages=13–15, 281–83|isbn=978-0-7619-2408-1|oclc=50725450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Rules PLO Can Retain Office|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|date=30 June 1988|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine Information Office v.

Fatah has, since its inception, created, led or sponsored a number of armed groups and militias, some of which have had an official standing as the movement's armed wing, and some of which have not been publicly or even internally recognized as such. The group has also dominated various PLO and Palestinian Authority forces and security services which were/are not officially tied to Fatah, but in practice have served as wholly pro-Fatah armed units, and been staffed largely by members. The original name for Fatah's armed wing was al-'Asifah ("The Storm"), and this was also the name Fatah first used in its communiques, trying for some time to conceal its identity. This name has since been applied more generally to Fatah armed forces, and does not correspond to a single unit today. Other militant groups associated with Fatah include:
*[[Force 17]]. Plays a role akin to the Presidential Guard for senior Fatah leaders.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Created by Yasser Arafat.
*[[Black September Organization]]. A group formed by leading Fatah members in 1971, following the events of the "[[Black September]]" in Jordan, to organize clandestine attacks with which Fatah did not want to be openly associated. These included strikes against leading Jordanian politicians as a means of exacting vengeance and raising the price for attacking the Palestinian movement; and also, most controversially, for "international operations" (e.g. the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympics massacre]]), intended to put pressure on the US, Europe and Israel, to raise the visibility of the Palestinian cause and to upstage radical rivals such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]]. Fatah publicly disassociated itself from the group, but it is widely believed that it enjoyed Arafat's direct or tacit backing. It was discontinued in 1973–1974, as Fatah's political line shifted again, and the Black September operations and the strategy behind them were seen as having become a political liability, rather than an asset.
*[[Fatah Hawks]]. An armed militia active mainly until the mid-1990s.
*[[Tanzim]]. A branch of Fatah under the leadership of Marwan Barghouti, with roots in the activism of the [[First Intifada]], which carried out armed attacks in the early days of the Second Intifada. It was later subsumed or sidelined by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
*[[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]]. Created during the Second Intifada to bolster the organization's militant standing vis-à-vis the rival Hamas movement, which had taken the lead in attacks on Israel after 1993, and was gaining rapidly in popularity with the advent of the Intifada. The Brigades are locally organized and have been said to suffer from poor cohesion and internal discipline, at times ignoring ceasefires and other initiatives announced by the central Fatah leadership. They are generally seen as tied to the "young guard" of Fatah politics, organizing young members on the street level, but it is not clear that they form a faction in themselves inside Fatah politics; rather, different Brigades units may be tied to different Fatah factional leaders.

During the Second Intifada, the group was a member of the [[Palestinian National and Islamic Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmcc.org/banner/banner1/bayan/aqsbayan14.htm Statement issued by the National and Islamic Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425165617/http://www.jmcc.org/banner/banner1/bayan/aqsbayan14.htm |date=25 April 2006 }} 10 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution===
In August 2009, at Fatah's Sixth General Conference in [[Bethlehem]], Fatah delegates drew up a new "internal charter".&lt;ref name="utpba.net"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/dni/osc/fatah-charter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an American citizen sued the Ethiopian government for surreptitiously installing FinSpy onto his computer in America and using it to wiretap his private Skype calls and monitor his entire family’s every use of the computer for a period of months.&lt;ref name="Kopstein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.eff.org/press/releases/american-sues-ethiopian-government-spyware-infection|title = American Sues Ethiopian Government for Spyware Infection|last = |first = |date = February 18, 2014|work = Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate = 2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lench IT Solutions plc has a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based branch, [[Gamma International]] Ltd in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], England, and a Germany-based branch, Gamma International GmbH in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="RSF-Corporate_Enemies"&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/gamma-international/ "Corporate Enemies: Gamma International"], ''The Enemies of the Internet, Special Edition: Surveillance'', Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B72512&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyber Attacks on Activists Traced to FinFisher Spyware of Gamma|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-25/cyber-attacks-on-activists-traced-to-finfisher-spyware-of-gamma.html|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=July 25, 2012|author=Vernon Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma International is a subsidiary of the [[Gamma Group]], specializing in surveillance and monitoring, including equipment, software, and training services.&lt;ref name="RSF-Corporate_Enemies" /&gt; It was reportedly owned by William Louthean Nelson through a [[shell corporation]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. The shell corporation was signed by a nominee director in order to withhold the identity of the ultimate beneficiary, which was Nelson, a common system for companies that are established offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/the-2014-finfisher-leaks-were-a-precursor-to-both-vault-7-and-panama-papers-finfishervault7-wikileaks/|title=The 2014 FinFisher Leaks were a precursor to both Vault 7 and Panama Papers|website=wikileaksdecrypted.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2014, FinFisher source code, pricing, support history, and other related data were retrieved from the Gamma International internal network and made available on the Internet.&lt;ref name="breach"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gamma FinFisher hacked: 40 GB of internal documents and source code of government malware published |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/ |date=August 6, 2014 |publisher=Netzpolitik.org |accessdate=August 6, 2014 |author=Andre Meister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the FinFisher suite==
In addition to [[spyware]], the FinFisher suite offered by Gamma to the intelligence community includes monitoring of ongoing developments and updating of solutions and techniques which complement those developed by intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=FFPortfolioupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio|url=http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/portfolio.php|work=FinFisher IT Intrusion|publisher=Gamma Group|accessdate=August 31, 2012|quote=Gamma addresses ongoing developments in the IT Intrusion field with solutions to enhance the capabilities of our clients. Easy to use high-end solutions and techniques complement the intelligence community’s knowhow enabling it to address relevant Intrusion challenges on a tactical level.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software suite, which the company calls "Remote Monitoring and Deployment Solutions", has the ability to take control of target computers and to capture even encrypted data and communications. Using "enhanced remote deployment methods" it can install software on target computers.&lt;ref name=FFPortfoliosoftware&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio|url=http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/portfolio.php|work=FinFisher IT Intrusion|publisher=Gamma Group|accessdate=August 31, 2012|quote=The Remote Monitoring and Deployment Solutions are used to access target Systems to give full access to stored information with the ability to take control of target systems' functions to the point of capturing encrypted data and communications. When used in combination with enhanced remote deployment methods, the Government Agencies will have the capability to remotely deploy software on target systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "IT Intrusion Training Program" is offered which includes training in methods and techniques and in the use of the company-supplied software.&lt;ref name=FFPortfoliotraining&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio|url=http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/portfolio.php|work=FinFisher IT Intrusion|publisher=Gamma Group|accessdate=August 31, 2012|quote=The IT Intrusion Training Program includes courses on both, products supplied as well as practical IT Intrusion methods and techniques. This program transfers years of knowledge and experience to endusers, thus maximizing their capabilities in this field.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suite is marketed in Arabic, English, German, French, Portuguese, and Russian and offered worldwide at trade shows offering an intelligence support system, ISS, training, and products to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=GGNews&gt;{{cite web|title=News|url=http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/news.php|publisher=Gamma Group|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of infection==
FinFisher malware is installed in various ways, including fake software updates, [[email]]s with fake [[Email attachment|attachments]], and security flaws in popular software. Sometimes the surveillance suite is installed after the target accepts installation of a fake update to commonly used software.&lt;ref name=Wsj2011-11-21 /&gt; Code which will install the [[malware]] has also been detected in emails.&lt;ref name=NYT81312 /&gt; The software, which is designed to evade detection by antivirus software, has versions which work on mobile phones of all major brands.&lt;ref name=NYT83012 /&gt;

A security flaw in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]] allowed unauthorized third parties to use iTunes online update procedures to install unauthorized programs.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph2011-11-28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DerSpiegel2011-11-22 /&gt; Gamma International offered presentations to government security officials at security software trade shows where they described how to covertly install the FinFisher spy software on suspects' computers using iTunes' update procedures.

The security flaw in iTunes that FinFisher is reported to have exploited was first described in 2008 by security software commentator [[Brian Krebs]].&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph2011-11-28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DerSpiegel2011-11-22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krebs&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple did not patch the security flaw for more than three years, until November 2011. Apple officials have not offered an explanation as to why the flaw took so long to patch. Promotional videos used by the firm at trade shows which illustrate how to infect a computer with the surveillance suite were released by [[WikiLeaks]] in December, 2011.&lt;ref name=B72512 /&gt;

In 2014, the Ethiopian government was found to have installed FinSpy on the computer of an American citizen via a fake email attachment that appeared to be a [[Doc (computing)|Microsoft Word document]].&lt;ref name="Kopstein" /&gt;

FinFisher has also been found to engage in politically motivated targeting. In Ethiopia, for instance, photos of a political opposition group are used to "bait" and infect users.&lt;ref name=Citizen03132013 /&gt;

Technical analysis of the malware, methods of infection and its persistence techniques has been published in Code And Security blog in four parts.&lt;ref name=CodeAndSec&gt;{{cite news

==Use by repressive regimes==
* FinFisher's wide use by governments facing political resistance was reported in March 2011 after Egyptian protesters raided [[State Security Investigations Service]] and found letters from Gamma International UK Ltd., confirming that SSI had been using a trial version for five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restrictions on freedom of communication|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/columns/view.aspx?cdate=23102012&amp;id=c5b92fd7-d56e-484c-865b-f7856fde2a48#.UIgxY6rEuk5.facebook|work=shorouknews.com|publisher=Sunrise Gateway|accessdate=25 March 2014|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* A similar report in August 2012 concerned e-mails received by Bahraini activists and passed on (via a [[Bloomberg News]] reporter) to University of Toronto computer researchers Bill Marczak and [[Morgan Marquis-Boire]] in May 2012. Analysis of the e-mails revealed code (FinSpy) designed to install  spyware on the recipient's computer.&lt;ref name=NYT83012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT81312&gt;{{cite news|title=Elusive FinSpy Spyware Pops Up in 10 Countries|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/elusive-finspy-spyware-pops-up-in-10-countries/|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012|author=Nicole Perlroth|format=blog by reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Gamma claims no software was sold to Bahrain and that the software detected by the researchers was not a legitimate copy but perhaps a stolen, reverse-engineered or modified demonstration copy.&lt;ref name=BN72712&gt;{{cite news|title=Gamma Says No Spyware Sold to Bahrain; May Be Stolen Copy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-27/gamma-says-no-spyware-sold-to-bahrain-may-be-stolen-copy.html|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=July 27, 2012|author=Vernon Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 [[Bahrain Watch]] claimed that the leak of FinFisher data contained evidence suggesting that the Bahraini government was using the software to spy on opposition figures, highlighting communications between Gamma International support staff and a customer in Bahrain, and identifying a number of human rights lawyers, politicians, activists and journalists who had apparently been targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bahrainwatch.org/blog/2014/08/07/uk-spyware-used-to-hack-bahrain-lawyers-activists/ |title=Bahrain Government Hacked Lawyers and Activists with UK Spyware |last1=Desmukh |first1=Fahad |date=7 August 2014 |website=[[Bahrain Watch]] |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to a document dated 7 December 2012 from the Federal Ministry of the Interior to members of the Finance Committee of the German Parliament, the German "Bundesnachrichtendienst", the Federal Surveillance Agency, have licensed FinFisher/FinSpy, even though its legality in Germany is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Secret Government Document Reveals: German Federal Police Plans To Use Gamma FinFisher Spyware |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2013/secret-government-document-reveals-german-federal-police-plans-to-use-gamma-finfisher-spyware/ |accessdate=19 July 2013 |author=Andre Meister |publisher=Netzpolitik.org |date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, an America citizen sued the Ethiopian government for installing and using FinSpy to record a vast array of activities conducted by users of the machine, all whilst in America. Traces of the spyware inadvertently left on his computer show that information – including recordings of dozens of Skype phone calls – was surreptitiously sent to a secret control server located in Ethiopia and controlled by the Ethiopian government. FinSpy was downloaded on the plaintiff's computer when he opened an email with a Microsoft Word document attached. The attachment contained hidden malware that infected his computer.&lt;ref name=Kopstein&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hackers-without-borders|title = Hackers Without Borders|last = Kopfstein|first = Janus|date = March 10, 2014|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, FinFisher was reported to have been in use since 2012 for the 'Fungua Macho' surveillance programme of [[Uganda]]'s [[President Museveni]], spying upon the Ugandan opposition party, the [[Forum for Democratic Change]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporters Without Borders==
On 12 March 2013 [[Reporters Without Borders]] named Gamma International as one of five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet" and “digital era mercenaries” for selling products that have been or are being used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. FinFisher technology was used in [[Bahrain]] and Reporters Without Borders, together with [[Privacy International]], the [[European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights]] (ECCHR), the [[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]], and Bahrain Watch filed an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) complaint, asking the National Contact Point in the United Kingdom to further investigate Gamma’s possible involvement in Bahrain. Since then research has shown that FinFisher technology was used in Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Britain, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Qatar, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="RSF-Corporate_Enemies"/&gt;&lt;ref name=B72512 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/finfisher-mobile-spyware-tracking-politi/240006620 "FinFisher Mobile Spyware Tracking Political Activists"], Mathew J. Schwartz, ''Information Week'', 31 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/researchers-find-25-countries-using-surveillance-software/ "Researchers Find 25 Countries Using Surveillance Software"],  Nicole Perlroth, ''The New York Times'', 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://citizenlab.org/2013/04/for-their-eyes-only-2/ "For Their Eyes Only: The Commercialization of Digital Spying"], Morgan Marquis-Boire with Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, and John Scott-Railton, Citizen Lab and Canada Centre for Global Security Studies, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, 1 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firefox masquerading==
FinFisher is capable of masquerading as other more legitimate programs, such as [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]]. On April 30, 2013, [[Mozilla]] announced that they had sent Gamma a cease-and-desist letter for trademark infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/30/protecting-our-brand-from-a-global-spyware-provider/ "Protecting our brand from a global spyware provider"], Mozilla Foundation, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma had created an espionage program that was entitled firefox.exe and even provided a version number and trademark claims to appear to be legitimate Firefox software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/01/mozilla-fights-against-spyware-company-and-its-exploits/ June, Daniel, "Mozilla Fights Against Spyware Company and its Exploits"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
In an article of ''[[PC Magazine]]'', Bill Marczak (member of Bahrain Watch and computer science PhD student at [[University of California, Berkeley]] doing research into FinFisher) said of FinSpy Mobile (Gamma's mobile spyware): "As we saw with respect to the desktop version of FinFisher, antivirus alone isn't enough, as it bypassed antivirus scans".&lt;ref name=pcmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/none/302174-lessons-learnt-from-finfisher-mobile-spyware|title=Lessons Learnt From FinFisher Mobile Spyware|author=Sara Yin|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article's author Sara Yin, an analyst at ''PC Magazine'', predicted that antivirus providers are likely to have updated their signatures to detect FinSpy Mobile.&lt;ref name=pcmag /&gt;

According to announcements from [[ESET]], FinFisher and FinSpy are detected by ESET antivirus software as "Win32/Belesak.D" [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan]].&lt;ref name=ESET1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/08/30/finfisher-helps-people-spy-on-you-via-your-cellphone-for-good-or-evil/|title=FinSpy and FinFisher spy on you via your cellphone and PC, for good or evil?|date=August 31, 2012|author=Cameron Camp|publisher=WeLiveSecurity|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESET2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/08/31/finfisher-and-the-ethics-of-detection/|title=Finfisher and the Ethics of Detection|date=August 31, 2012|author=David Harley|publisher=WeLiveSecurity|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other security vendors claim that their products will block any spyware they know about and can detect (regardless of who may have launched it), and [[Eugene Kaspersky]], head of IT security company [[Kaspersky Lab]], stated, "We detect all malware regardless its purpose and origin".&lt;ref name=IW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/tech-center/mobile-security/finfisher-mobile-spyware-tracking-politi/240006620|title=FinFisher Mobile Spyware Tracking Political Activists|date=August 31, 2012|author=Mathew J. Schwartz|publisher=[[Information Week]]|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years after that statement by Eugene Kaspersky in 2012 a description of the technique used by FinFisher to evade Kaspersky protection was published in Part 2 of the relevant blog at Code And Security.

The '''First Civil Service Commissioner''' heads the '''[[Civil Service Commissioners (United Kingdom)|Office of Civil Service Commissioners]]''', which ensures that the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service in the United Kingdom]] is effective and impartial and that appointments are made on merit, and hears appeals under the [[Civil Service Code]].

The post was created in 1855 following publication of the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] by [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] and [[Stafford Northcote]] that advocated the decoupling of appointments of senior civil servants from ministers to insure the impartiality of the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Walker | first =David | title = Fair game| pages = | work=The Guardian | date = 2003-07-09| url =https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement | accessdate =2003-07-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]], ''"Defining the Boundaries within the Executive: Ministers, special advisers and the permanent Civil Service"'' in 2003, the appointment of the First Civil Service Commissioner is made by Government after consultation with the leaders of the main opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Government publishes response to the ninth report of the committee on standards in public life |publisher=10 Downing Street |date=2003-09-11 |url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page4447.asp |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611003421/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page4447.asp |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are then appointed by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] under Royal Prerogative.&lt;ref name=Janet /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">'''General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France''' ("Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France", DGLFLF) is, in [[France]], a unit of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture and Communication]]. Its mission is to lead, at the interdepartmental level, the language policy of France, concerning both the French and regional languages.

== History ==

Created in 1989 under the name "General Delegation for the French language" (DGLF), it became in 2001 the "General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France" to take into account regional languages.

It was the successor of the ''Commissioner General to the French language'' (aka ''High Commissioner to the French language''), created in 1984 to replace the ''High Committee for defense and expansion of the French language'', itself created in 1966 by General [[Charles de Gaulle]] and renamed "High Committee of the French language" in 1973.

== Missions ==

The DGLFLF ensures compliance with the Act of August 4, 1994 in France, called the Toubon law and, in particular, the implementing decree of 1996 to enrich the French language and its provisions on the use of language. It coordinates with the General Commission of Terminology and Neologisms the development of terminology lists by the specialized committees of terminology and the French Academy. Specifically, it participated in the implementation of "FranceTerme", a terminological dictionary available to the general public on the internet.

It participates in programs teaching French to migrants. It supports the use of regional languages in the media and entertainment.

Until 2005, it assisted the secretariat of the Supreme Council of the French language.

It organizes an annual "Week of the French language and French speakers" in March.

Under the departmental plan for overseas, the General Delegation of the French language and the languages of France / Ministry of Culture and Communication, held in [[Cayenne, French Guiana]], from 14 to 18 December 2011, the congress of multilingualism overseas (EGM-OM). The event brought together some 250 participants from throughout the [[French overseas territories]] and overseas [[metropolitan France]] and neighboring countries with the objective to make general recommendations for the implementation of a policy for languages overseas. The DGLFLF chose to draft acts of EGM-OM on Wikibooks.

== List of Delegates General ==

General delegates to the French language, then to the French language and the languages of France, were successively:
* 1989: Bernard Cerquiglini
* 1993: Anne Magnant
* 2001: Bernard Cerquiglini
* 2004: North Xavier

In Iran, demonstrations such as the anniversary of [[Islamic revolution]], are organized by government. In the past, people at these demonstrations have chanted "Down with Israel" and "[[Death to America]]" .&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003136464_mideast19.html The Seattle Times: Nation &amp; World: Israel, Hezbollah continue attacks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline///tehran/axis/nafisi.html How should Americans understand phrases like "Death to America" and "Great Satan"?] ''PBS'', an interview with [[Azar Nafisi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Korea]]n government regularly organizes demonstrations against [[South Korea]] or the US or in support of government policies.

Following the North Korean example, on 16 November 2013 the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Oresharski Government]] and the ruling [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (formerly [[Communism|communist]]) organized a pro-government demonstration in support of their own governance, which had at the time the lowest-ever popularity amongst the Bulgarian population since the end of [[One-party state|one-party rule]].

A similar example happened in Poland on 13 December 2015 when [[Jarosław Kaczyński]]'s party, [[Law and Justice]], changed their annual unofficial celebrations of the anniversary of the [[Martial law in Poland|introduction of the Martial Law]] into a pro-government rally &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nto.pl/polska-i-swiat/art/9186343,warszawa-marsz-wolnosci-i-solidarnosci-2015-manifestacja-pis-13-grudnia-w-warszawie-zdjecia,id,t.html&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance a 50 000 strong "prodemocratic demonstration" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/marsz-kod-wazna-sprawa-panstwo-prawa,602314.html&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[Democracy Defence Committee]], protesting against what they called the breaking of the [[Constitution of Poland|constitution]] by Law and Justice' [[President of Poland|president]] [[Andrzej Duda]] and [[Beata Szydło]]'s government.

A '''grand jury''' is a [[jury]] – a group of [[citizen]]s – empowered by law to conduct [[legal proceedings]] and investigate potential [[crime|criminal conduct]], and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may [[subpoena]] physical evidence or a person to testify. A grand jury is separate from the [[court]]s, which do not preside over its functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/36 112 S.Ct. 1735 504 U.S. 36 118 L.Ed.2d 352 UNITED STATES, Petitioner v. John H. WILLIAMS, Jr. No. 90-1972. Argued Jan. 22, 1992. Decided May 4, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] and [[Liberia]] are the only countries that retain grand juries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nestmann|first1=Mark|title=The Lifeboat Strategy|year= 2011|publisher=The Nestmann Group|isbn=9781891266409|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5VSQl5L78C&amp;pg=PT110&amp;lpg=PT110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zapf|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Roesch|first2=Ronald|last3=Hart|first3=Stephen D.|title=Forensic Psychology and Law|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-57039-5|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hOslS-NSCVEC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other [[common law]] jurisdictions formerly employed them, and most others now employ some other form of [[preliminary hearing]]. Grand juries perform both accusatory and investigatory functions. The investigatory functions of grand juries include obtaining and reviewing documents and other evidence, and hearing sworn testimonies of witnesses who appear before it; the accusatory function determines whether there is [[probable cause]] to believe that one or more persons committed a certain offence within the venue of a district court.

A grand jury in the United States is usually composed of 16 to 23 citizens, though in Virginia it has fewer members for regular or special grand juries. In [[Ireland]], they also functioned as local government authorities. In Japan, the Law of July 12, 1948 created the ''Kensatsu Shinsakai'' (Prosecutorial Review Commission or PRC system), inspired by the American system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1699&amp;context=cilj|title=e Rebirth of Japan’s Petit Quasi-Jury and Grand Jury Systems: A Cross-National Analysis of Legal Consciousness and the Lay Participatory Experience in Japan and the U.S.|last=Fukurai|first=Hiroshi|date=August 4, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury is so named because traditionally it has more jurors than a trial [[jury]], sometimes called a [[petit jury]] (from the French word ''petit'' meaning "small").&lt;ref name="LawDict"&gt;A Law Dictionary by Henry Campbell Black 2nd ed , publ. by West, St Paul, Minnesota,1910.

==Purpose==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
The function of a grand jury is to accuse persons who may be guilty of an offense, but the institution is also a shield against unfounded and oppressive prosecution. It is a means for lay citizens, representative of the community, to participate in the administration of justice. It can also make presentments on crime and maladministration in its area. The traditional number of the grand jury is 23.

The mode of accusation is by a written statement in solemn form (indictment) describing the offense with proper accompaniments of time and circumstances, and certainty of act and person or by a mode less formal, which is usually the spontaneous act of the grand jury, called presentment.&lt;ref name=Blackstone1&gt;Commentaries on the Laws of England, by William Blackstone, Book 4,  Ch.23   (p. 586 in 1840 ed. of John Bethune Bayly)&lt;/ref&gt; No indictment or presentment can be made except by concurrence of at least twelve of the jurors. The grand jury may accuse upon their own knowledge, but it is generally done upon the testimony of witnesses under oath and other evidence heard before them. The proceedings of grand jury are, in the first instance, at the instigation of the government or other prosecutor, and ex parte and in secret deliberation. The accused has no knowledge nor right to interfere with their proceedings.&lt;ref name=britcyclop&gt;British Cyclopedia of Literature, History,Geography, Law and Politics, publ. by Orr and Smith, London, 1836,  Vol 2, p.591&lt;/ref&gt;

If they find the accusation true, which is usually drawn up in form by the prosecutor or an officer of the court, they write upon the indictment the words "a true bill" which is signed by the foreman of the grand jury and presented to the court publicly in the presence of all the jurors. If the indictment is not proven to the satisfaction of the grand jury, the word [[Wiktionary:ignoramus|"ignoramus"]] &lt;ref&gt;In [[Latin language|Latin]], "ignoramus" literally means “we are ignorant of” or “we do not know” - in the context of a Grand Jury it effectively means “we do not know of any reason why this person should be indicted on these charges”. This use of "ignoramus" long predates its more common English meaning of an ignorant person or dunce.&lt;/ref&gt; or "not a true bill" is written upon it by the grand jury, or by their foreman and then said to be ignored, and the accusation is dismissed as unfounded.  (The potential defendant is said to have been "no-billed" by the grand jury.)  If the grand jury returns an indictment as a true bill ("billa vera"), the indictment is said to be founded and the party to stand indicted and required to be put on trial.&lt;ref name=harris1&gt;The Criminal Law. by Seymour F. Harris, 7th ed., publ. Stevens &amp; Haynes, London, 1896. Book 3, Ch 7  Grand Jury (4th para)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The first instance of a grand jury can be traced back to the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166, an Act of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aclarendon.html Medieval Sourcebook: Assize of Clarendon 1166]&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's chief impact on the development of the English monarchy was to increase the jurisdiction of the royal courts at the expense of the feudal courts. Itinerant justices on regular circuits were sent out once each year to enforce the "King's Peace". To make this system of royal criminal justice more effective, Henry employed the method of [[inquest]] used by [[William the Conqueror]] in the [[Domesday Book]]. In each shire, a body of important men was sworn (''juré'') to report to the [[sheriff]] all crimes committed since the last session of the circuit court. Thus originated the more recent grand jury that presents information for an indictment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-world.org/midbritain.htm The Making of Modern Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury was later recognized by [[John of England|King John]] in [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 on demand of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcdave.com/article5/070119.htm Turley, Hugh: "The Grand Jury"], Hyattsville Life &amp; Times, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Jury can be said to have "celebrated" its 800th birthday in 2015, because a precursor to the Grand Jury is defined in Article 61, the longest of the 63 articles of [[Magna Carta]], also called ''Magna Carta Libertatum'' (Latin: "the Great Charter of Liberties") executed on 15 June 1215 by King John and by the Barons. The document was primarily composed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Stephen Langton]] (1150-1228). He and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed schemas for division of the Bible into chapters and it is the system of Archbishop Langton which prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], 1893, at [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347. Cited in [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2013/06/21/stephen-langton-and-the-modern-chapter-divisions-of-the-bible/ Stephen Langton and the modern chapter divisions of the bible] by British translator Roger Pearse, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Bible scholar, and the concept of the Grand Jury may possibly derive from Deuteronomy 25:1: "If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked." ([[King James Version]]) Thus the Grand Jury has been described as the "Shield and the Sword" of the People: as a "Shield for the People" from abusive indictments of the government- or malicious indictments of individuals- and as the "Sword of the People" to cut away crime by any private individual; or to cut away crime by any public servant, whether in the Judicial, Executive, or Legislative branches.

==Notable cases==
On 2 July 1681, a popular statesman, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] was arrested on suspicion of [[high treason]] and committed to the [[Tower of London]]. He immediately petitioned the [[Old Bailey]] on a writ of [[habeas corpus]], but the Old Bailey said it did not have jurisdiction over prisoners in the Tower of London, so Cooper had to wait for the next session of the [[Court of King's Bench]]. Cooper moved for a writ of habeas corpus on 24 October 1681, and his case finally came before a grand jury on 24 November 1681.

The government's case against Cooper was particularly weak – the government admitted that most of the witnesses brought against Cooper had already perjured themselves, and the documentary evidence was inconclusive; and the jury was handpicked by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] Sheriff of London. For these reasons the government had little chance of securing a conviction, and on 13 February 1682 the case was dropped when the Grand Jury issued an ''ignoramus'' bill, rather than comply with the King's intent of a "True Bill", known as a Grand Jury Indictment.

The grand jury's theoretical function against abuse of [[executive (government)|executive]] power was seen during the [[Watergate]] crisis in America, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8 to 0 on 23 July 1974 (Justice [[William Rehnquist]] who had been appointed by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] recused himself from the case) that [[executive privilege]] applied only to the co-equal branches, the legislative and judicial, not to grand jury subpoenas, thus implying a grand jury constituted protections equaled to a "fourth branch of government". The second Watergate grand jury indicted seven lawyers in the White House, including former Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and named President Nixon as a "secret, un-indicted, co-conspirator." Despite evading [[impeachment]], Nixon was still required to testify before a grand jury.

Similarly, in 1998, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] became the first sitting president required to testify before a grand jury as subject of an investigation by the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Office of Independent Counsel]]. The testimony came after a four-year investigation into Clinton and his wife Hillary's alleged involvement in several scandals including Whitewater and the Rose Law Firm.  Revelations from the investigation sparked a battle in Congress over whether or not to impeach Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-testifies-before-grand-jury "This Day in History, 1998:  Clinton Testifies before Grand Jury"] (August 21, 2018).

==By jurisdiction==

===England and Wales===
The sheriff of every county was required to return to every [[quarter session]]s and [[assizes]] (or more precisely the commission of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' and of gaol delivery), 24 men of the county "to inquire into, present, do and execute all those things which, on the part of our Lord the King (''or'' our Lady the Queen), shall then be commanded them". Grand jurors at the assizes or at the borough quarter sessions did not have property qualifications; but, at the county quarter sessions, they had the same property qualification as petty jurors. However, at the assizes, the grand jury generally consisted of gentlemen of high standing in the county.

After the court was opened by the crier making proclamation, the names of those summoned to the grand jury were called and they were sworn. They numbered at least 14 and not more than 23. The person presiding (the judge at the assizes, the chairman at the county sessions, the recorder at the borough sessions) gave the charge to the grand jury, i.e. he directed their attention to points in the various cases about to be considered which required explanation.

The charge having been delivered, the grand jury withdrew to their own room, having received the bills of [[indictment]]. The witnesses whose names were endorsed on each bill were sworn as they came to be examined, in the grand jury room, the oath being administered by the foreman, who wrote his initials against the name of the witness on the back of the bill. Only the witnesses for the prosecution were examined, as the function of the grand jury was merely to inquire whether there was sufficient ground to put the accused on trial. If the majority of them (and at least 12) thought that the evidence so adduced made out a sufficient case, the words "a true bill" were endorsed on the back of the bill. If they were of the opposite opinion, the phrase "not a true bill", or the single Latin word [[Wiktionary:ignoramus|''ignoramus'']] ("we do not know" or "we are ignorant (of)"), was endorsed instead and the bill was said to be "ignored" or thrown out. They could find a true bill as to the charge in one count, and ignore that in another; or as to one defendant and not as to another; but they could not, like a petty jury, return a special or conditional finding, or select part of a count as true and reject the other part. When some bills were "found", some of the jurors came out and handed the bills to the clerk of arraigns (in assizes) or [[clerk of the peace]], who announced to the court the name of the prisoner, the charge, and the endorsements of the grand jury. They then retired and considered other bills until all were disposed of; after which they were discharged by the judge, chairman, or recorder.

If a bill was thrown out, although it could not again be preferred to the grand jury during the same assizes or sessions, it could be preferred at subsequent assizes or sessions, but not in respect of the same offence if a petty jury had returned a verdict.

Ordinarily, bills of indictment were preferred after there had been an examination before the [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]. But this need not always take place. With certain exceptions, any person could prefer a bill of indictment against another before the grand jury without any previous inquiry into the truth of the accusation before a magistrate. This right was at one time universal and was often abused. A substantial check was put on this abuse by the [[Vexatious Indictments Act 1859]].&lt;ref&gt;22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. 17, s. l.&lt;/ref&gt; This Act provided that for certain offences which it listed (perjury, libel, etc.), the person presenting such an indictment must be bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence against the accused, or alternatively had judicial permission (as specified) so to do.

If an indictment was found in the absence of the accused, and he/she was not in custody and had not been bound over to appear at assizes or sessions, then process was issued to bring that person into court, as it is contrary to the English law to "try" an indictment in the absence of the accused.

The grand jury's functions were gradually made redundant by the development of [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] in magistrates' courts from 1848 onward when the (three) [[John Jervis (politician)|Jervis]] Acts,&lt;ref&gt;See Indictable Offences Act 1848 (11 and 12 Vict c. 42); title: An Act to facilitate the Performance of the Duties of Justices of the Peace out of Sessions within England and Wales with respect to Persons charged with indictable Offences&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Justices Protection Act 1848]], codified and greatly expanded the functions of magistrates in pre-trial proceedings; these proceedings developed into almost a repeat of the trial itself. In 1933 the grand jury ceased to function in England, under the [[Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/36/contents legislation.gov.uk: "Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933" (23 &amp; 24 Geo 5 c 36)]&lt;/ref&gt; and was entirely abolished in 1948, when a clause from 1933 saving grand juries for offences relating to officials abroad was repealed by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

===Scotland===

The grand jury was introduced in [[Scotland]], solely for [[high treason]], a year after the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]], by the [[Treason Act 1708]], an [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Parliament]] of [[Great Britain]]. Section III of the Act required the Scottish courts to try cases of treason and [[misprision of treason]] according to English rules of procedure and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Treason Act, 1708 (7 Ann c 21)&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was repealed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Treason Act 1945 (c. 44), section 2(2) and Schedule.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Scottish grand jury under this Act met at Edinburgh on 10 October 1748 to take cognisance of the charges against such rebels as had not surrendered, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].

An account of its first use in Scotland illustrates the institution's characteristics. It consisted of 23 good and lawful men, chosen out of 48 who were summoned: 24 from the county of [[Edinburgh]] ([[Midlothian]]), 12 from [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] ([[East Lothian]]) and 12 from [[Linlithgow]] ([[West Lothian]]). The court consisted of three judges from the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (Scotland's highest criminal court), of whom [[Charles Erskine, Lord Tinwald|Tinwald]] ([[Lord Justice Clerk|Justice Clerk]]) was elected  ''preses'' (presiding member). [[Subpoena]]s under the seal of the court and signed by the clerk were executed on a great number of persons in different shires, requiring them to appear as witnesses under the penalty of £100 each. The ''preses'' named Sir John Inglis of [[Cramond]] as Foreman of the Grand Jury, who was sworn first in the English manner by kissing the book; the others followed three at a time; after which Lord Tinwald, addressing the jurors, informed them that the power [[Lord Advocate|His Majesty's advocate]] possessed before the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]], of prosecuting any person for high treason, who appeared guilty on a precognition taken of the facts, being now done away, power was lodged with them, a grand jury, 12 of whom behoved to concur before a true bill could be found. An indictment was then preferred in court and the witnesses endorsed on it were called over and sworn; on which the jury retired to the exchequer chambers and the witnesses were conducted to a room near it, whence they were called to be examined separately. Two solicitors for the crown were present at the examination but no-one else; and after they had finished and the sense of the jury was collected, the indictment was returned a "[[true bill]]", if the charges were found proved, or "[[wikt:ignoramus|ignoramus]]" if doubtful. The proceedings continued for a week, in which time, out of 55 bills, 42 were sustained and 13 dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;The  "History of Scotland, With Notes, and a Continuation to the Present Time", by George Buchanan (up to 16th Century) and James Aikman, Edinburgh 1829. See Vol. 6,p.486&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Acts of Parliament in the 19th century regarding treason did not specify this special procedure and the Grand Jury was used no longer.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], grand juries were active from the [[Middle Ages]] during the [[Lordship of Ireland]] in parts of the island under the control of the English government ([[The Pale]]), that was followed by the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. They mainly functioned as local government authorities at the [[Counties of Ireland|county]] level. The system was so-called as the grand jurors had to present their [[public works]] proposals and budgets in court for official sanction by a [[judge]]. Grand jurors were usually the largest local payers of [[Rates (tax)|rates]], and therefore tended to be the larger [[landlord]]s, and on retiring they selected new members from the same background.

Distinct from their public works function, as property owners they also were qualified to sit on criminal juries hearing [[Jury trial|trials by jury]], as well as having a pre-trial judicial function for serious criminal cases. Many of them also sat as [[Justice of the peace|magistrates]] judging the less serious cases.

They were usually wealthy "country gentlemen" (i.e. landowners, [[landed gentry]], farmers and merchants):
{{quote|A country gentleman as a member of a Grand Jury...levied the local taxes, appointed the nephews of his old friends to collect them, and spent them when they were gathered in. He controlled the boards of guardians and appointed the dispensary doctors, regulated the diet of paupers, inflicted fines and administered the law at petty sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=R.

From 1691 to 1793, [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] and [[Roman Catholic]]s were excluded from membership. The concentration of power and wealth in a few families caused resentment over time. The whole local government system started to become more representative from the passing of the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]]. Grand juries were replaced by democratically elected [[County council#Ireland (1899 - 1922)|County Councils]] by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], as regards their administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=J.

After the formation of [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, grand juries were not required, but they persisted in [[Northern Ireland]] until abolished by the Grand Jury (Abolition) Act of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliament, 1969 c.15&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Grand juries in the United States}}
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]] reads, "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury{{nbsp}}..."

[[File:Grand jury at Arcadia Hotel fire (LOC).jpg|thumb|A grand jury investigating the fire that destroyed the Arcadia Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts in 1913]]
In the early decades of the United States, grand juries played a major role in public matters. During that period counties followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least 12 of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a 23-person grand jury, 12 people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations.

In that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise the authority{{clarify|date=February 2016}} of an attorney general, that is, one having a [[private attorney general|general power of attorney]] to represent the state in the case.

The grand jury served to screen out incompetent or malicious prosecutions.&lt;ref name=gje&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=George John|title=The Grand Jury: Considered from an Historical, Political and Legal Standpoint, and the Law and Practice Relating Thereto|year=1906|publisher=G.T.

===Canada===
Grand juries were once common across Canada.  The institution of British civil government in 1749 at [[Nova Scotia]] brought the judicature system peculiar to that form, and the grand jury was inherent to it.  A similar form derived in Quebec from the promise of the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] that a faithful copy of '''Laws of England''' would be instituted in the North American possessions of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/rp_1763.html Royal Proclamation of 1763]&lt;/ref&gt; Archival records are found that document the presentments of a grand jury in Quebec as early as 16 October 1764.  One of the chief complaints was related to the jury trial, and the use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Doughty&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire for English law was a driver for [[Constitutional Act of 1791|the division in 1791 of Quebec, as it was then known]], at the Ottawa river into [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], as each of the two groups (French and English) desired to maintain their traditions.  In point of fact, the second law passed in Upper Canada relates to (petit) jury trial.  This was continued so that Chapter 31 of the 1859 Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada specifies the constitution of Grand and Petit Juries in the province (now known as Ontario).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924016981684 archive.org: "Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The colony at St. John's Island, ceded by France in 1763, and separated on 30 May 1769 from Nova Scotia,&lt;ref name=nscourts&gt;[http://www.courts.ns.ca/history/timeline.htm "Timeline History of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017110236/http://www.courts.ns.ca/history/timeline.htm |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Prince Edward Island]] on 29 November 1798.  Prince Edward Island derived its grand jury from its administrative parent between 1763 and 1769, Nova Scotia, as did [[Sunbury County]] when it was split off in 1784 to become the [[Colony of New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name=nscourts/&gt; The [[Colony of British Columbia]], when it was formed on 2 August 1858, instituted a grand jury,&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; along with the [[Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands]] (1853–1863) and the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] (1848–1866) when the latter were absorbed by the former.

Old courthouses with the two jury boxes necessary to accommodate the 24 jurors of a grand jury can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1674089 Stokes, Mary: "Grand Juries and ‘Proper Authorities’: Low Law, Soft Law and Local Governance in Canada West/Ontario, 1850–1880"]&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury would evaluate charges and return what was called a "true bill (of indictment)" if the charges were to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips Cables Ltd. v.

The grand jury existed in [[New South Wales]] for a short period in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Establishment of Jury Trial in New South Wales |first= J.M. |last= Bennett |publisher= Faculty of Law, University of Sydney |year= 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New South Wales Act 1823]] (UK) enabled the establishment of [[quarter session]]s, as a subsidiary court structure below that of the Supreme Court. [[Francis Forbes]], [[Chief Justice]], reasoned that this entailed the creation of quarter sessions as they existed in England. Thus, inadvertently, [[trial by jury]] and indictment by grand jury were introduced, but only for these subsidiary courts. Grand juries met in [[Sydney]], [[Parramatta]], [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and other places. This democratic method of trial proved very popular, but was resented by conservatives. Eventually, conservative elements in the colony were successful in having these innovations suppressed by the Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK). [[George Forbes (New South Wales politician)|George Forbes]], a member of the Legislative Council, unsuccessfully moved for the reintroduction of grand juries in 1858, but this was thwarted by the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Criminal Law in New South Wales: The Colonial Period, 1788-1900'', by G.D. Woods QC, Federation Press 2002, p.56-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], grand juries existed for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Grand Jury of South Australia |first= Greg |last= Taylor |journal= American Journal of Legal History |volume= 45 |issue= 4 |date= October 2001 |pages= 468–516 |doi=10.2307/3185314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Australia, the first grand jury sat on 13 May 1837, but they were abolished in 1852. In Western Australia, by the Grand Jury Abolition Act Amendment Act 1883 (WA), grand juries were abolished (section 4: A Grand Jury shall not be summoned for the Supreme Court of Western Australia, nor for any General Quarter Sessions for the said Colony).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_10315_homepage.html|title=Grand Jury Abolition Act Amendment Act 1883|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] maintained, until 2009, provisions for a grand jury in the [[Crimes Act 1958]] under section 354 indictments, which had been used on rare occasions by individuals to bring other persons to court seeking them to be committed for trial on indictable offences. Grand juries were introduced by the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873|Judicature Act 1874]] and have been used on a very limited number of occasions. Their function in Victoria particularly relates to alleged offences either by bodies corporate or where magistrates have aborted the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Legal History |date= September 1987 |title=The introduction and use of the grand jury in Victoria |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |first= Elise |last= Histed |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01440368708530896?journalCode=flgh20 |doi=10.1080/01440368708530896 |pages=167–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] abolished the grand jury in 1961.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt;

===Cape Colony===

[[Trial by jury]] was introduced in the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] by [[Richard Bourke]], Lieutenant Governor and acting Governor of the colony between 1826-28. The acting Governor, who was later influential in the establishment of jury trial in [[New South Wales]], obtained the consent of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in August 1827 and the first Charter of Justice was issued on 24 August 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Commission of Inquiry into the Administration of Justice in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope (Records of the Cape Colony xxviii (1905) I-III, George McCall Theale)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jury trial was brought into practical operation in 1828 and the 1831 Ordinance 84 laid down that criminal cases would be heard by a panel of nine, selected from males aged between 21 and 60, owning or renting property to a value of £1:17 shillings per annum or having liability for taxes of 30 shillings in Cape Town and 20 shillings outside the town. Black (i.e. non-white) jurors were not entirely excluded and sat occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;E. Kahn: South African Law Journal(1991), pp.672-87; SALJ(1992), pp.87-111, 307-18, 666-79; SALJ(1993), pp.322-37&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to imply, however, that juries did not operate in an oppressive manner towards the Black African and Asian residents of the Cape, whose participation in the jury lists was, in any event, severely limited by the property qualification.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The international development of the jury : the role of the British empire, by Richard Vogler in Revue internationale de droit pénal, 2001 (vol 72)&lt;/ref&gt; The property qualification was amended in 1831 and 1861 and, experimentally, a grand jury came into operation.

The grand jury was established for Cape Town alone.&lt;ref&gt;Cape Law Journal, 10 Cape L.J. page 216 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; It met quarterly. In 1842 it was recorded&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes Narrative of the U.S. Exploring Expedition. Page 302&lt;/ref&gt; that it served a district of 50,000 inhabitants and in one quarterly session there were six presentments (1 homicide, 2 assaults, 1 robbery, 1 theft, 1 fraud).

As elsewhere, the judge could use his charge to the Grand Jury to bring matters of concern to him to the attention of the public and the government.&lt;ref&gt;See "Grand Jury", by George Edwards, pub. Philadelphia 1906. Part IV p.124&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1879 Mr. Justice Fitzpatrick, returning from circuit in the northern and western parts of Cape Colony, gave a charge to the grand jury at the Criminal Sessions at Cape Town, in which, after congratulating them upon the lightness of the calendar, he observed there were indications in the country of a growing mutual bad feeling between the races, etc. This was reported in the ''Cape Argus'' and was a subject of a question to the government in the House of Commons in London.&lt;ref&gt;HC Deb 19 June 1879 vol 247 cc169-71&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury continued in operation until 1885, by which time the Cape was under [[responsible government]], when it was abolished by Act 17 of 1885&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of the Cape of Good Hope, 1652-1895: Vol 1872-1886, pub. by J.C. Juta, Cape Town, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]].

===France===
Grand juries were established in [[France]] in 1791 under the name ''jury d'accusation'', but they were abolished with the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code#Code of criminal instruction|Code of Criminal Instruction]] in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;History of Trial by Jury, by William Forsyth, pub J.W. Parker, London 1852. Page 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury law of 1791 created an eight-man ''jury d'accusation'' in each ''[[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]'' (a subdivision of the ''departement'') and a 12-man ''jury de jugement'' in each ''[[Departments of France|departement]]''. In each ''arrondissement'' the ''procureur-syndic'' drew up a list of 30 jurors from the electoral roll every three months for the ''jury d'accusation''. There was no public prosecutor or ''[[juge d'instruction]]''. Instead the police or private citizens could bring a complaint to the [[Justice of the Peace]] established in each [[Cantons of France|canton]] (a subdivision of the arrondissement). This magistrate interrogated the accused to determine whether grounds for prosecution existed and if so sent the case to the ''directeur du jury'' (the director of the ''jury d'accusation''), who was one of the ''arrondissement's'' civil court judges, and who served in the post for six months on a rotating basis. He decided whether to dismiss the charges or, if not, whether the case was a ''[[delict|délit]]'' ([[misdemeanour]]) or a crime ([[felony]], i.e. imprisonable for 2 years or more). ''Délits'' went to the ''tribunal de police correctionnelle'' of the ''arrondissement'', while for ''crimes'' the ''directeur de jury'' convoked the ''jury d'accusation'' of the ''arrondissement'', in order to get an [[indictment]]. The ''directeur du jury'' drew up the [[bill of indictment]] (''acte d'accusation'') summarising the charges to be presented to the ''jury d'accusation''. The ''directeur'' made a presentation to the jury in the absence of the accused and the jury heard the witnesses. The jury then decided by majority vote whether there were sufficient grounds for the case to go to the ''tribunal criminel'' of the ''departement''. Between 1792-5 there was no property qualification for jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Juries and the Transformation of Criminal Justice in France in the 19th and 20th Centuries |first= James |last= Donovan |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-8078-3363-6 |at= Ch. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of the ''jury d’accusation'' were prescribed in the law of 1791 passed by the [[Constituent Assembly]] and were maintained and re-enacted in the ''Code des Délits et des Peines'' of 3 Brumaire, Year 4 (25 October 1795) and this was the operative law until it was abolished in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Théorie du Jury |first= Charles-François |last=Oudot |publisher= Joubert |location= Paris |year= 1845 |page= 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Special jury|Special juries]] and special grand juries were originally defined in law, for cases thought to require more qualified jurors, but these were abolished in Year 8 (1799).&lt;ref&gt;Archives de Droit et de Legislation, Tome 5, 2nd Semester, Brussels 1841. Page 83: ''Loi Belge du 15 Mai 1838 Relative au Jury Expliquée''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
From 1795 to 1808 grand juries also operated in [[Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;Archives de Droit et de Legislation, Tome 5, 2nd Semester, Brussels 1841. Page 73: ''Loi Belge du 15 Mai 1838 Relative au Jury Expliquée''&lt;/ref&gt;  which was divided into French ''[[departements]]''  in October 1795.

===Japan===

After [[World War II]], under the influence of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[Japan]] passed the Prosecutorial Review Commission Law on July 12, 1948, which created the ''Kensatsu Shinsakai'' (or Prosecutorial Review Commission (PRC) system), a figure analogue to the grand jury system. However, until 2009 the PCR's recommendations were not binding, and were only regarded as advisory.&lt;ref name="fukurai-lay-over"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukurai|first1=Hiroshi|title=Japan's Prosecutorial Review Commissions: Lay Oversight of the Government's Discretion of Prosecution|journal=University of Pennsylvania East Asia Law Review|date=2011|pages=5–10|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=ealr|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet Office on October 1990 showed that 68. 8% of surveyed Japanese citizens were not familiar with the PRC system.&lt;ref name="fukurai-lay-over" /&gt; On May 21, 2009, the Japanese government introduced new legislation which would make the PRC's decisions binding. A PRC is made up of 11 randomly selected citizens, is appointed to a six-month term, and its primary purpose is examining cases prosecutors have chosen not to continue prosecuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gastil |first1=John |last2=Fukurai |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Anderson |first3=Kent |last4=Nolan |first4=Mark |title=Seeing Is Believing: The Impact of Jury Service on Attitudes Toward Legal Institutions and the Implications for International Jury Reform |journal=Court Review |date=September 13, 2014 |volume=48 |page=126 |url=http://www.la1.psu.edu/cas/jurydem/SeeingIsBelieving_20130422100444_919286.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226014327/http://www.la1.psu.edu/cas/jurydem/SeeingIsBelieving_20130422100444_919286.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been perceived as a way to combat [[misfeasance]] in public officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukurai|first1=Hiroshi|title=Japan's Quasi-Jury and Grand Jury Systems as Deliberative Agents of Social Change: De-Colonial Strategies and Deliberative Participatory Democracy|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|date=January 2011|volume=86|issue=2|page=825|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3801&amp;context=cklawreview|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1945 to 1972 [[Okinawa]] was under American administration. Grand jury proceedings were held in the territory from 1963 until 1972.&lt;ref name=japancivil&gt;Japan and Civil Jury Trials: The Convergence of Forces 
by Matthew J. Wilson, Hiroshi Fukurai and Takashi Maruta, pub Edward Elgar Publications, October  2015. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt;  By an ordinance of the civil administration of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] promulgated in 1963, grand jury indictment and petit jury trial were assured for criminal defendants in the civil administration courts.&lt;ref name=japancivil/&gt; This ordinance reflected the concern of the U.S. Supreme Court &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court decision: Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; that U.S. civilians tried for crimes abroad under tribunals of U.S. provenance should not be shorn of the protections of the U.S. Bill of Rights. Indeed, the District Court in Washington twice held that the absence of the jury system in the civil administration courts in Okinawa invalidated criminal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;District (i.e. federal) court of the District of Columbia decisions: re Nicholson, H.C. 141-61, D.D.C., Nov. 19, 1963, and Ikeda v. McNamara, H.C. 416-62, D.D.C., Oct. 19, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
By article 21 of the [[constitution|Constitution of Liberia]],&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Liberia, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 'No person shall be held to answer for a capital or infamous crime except in cases of impeachment, cases arising in the Armed Forces and petty offenses, unless upon indictment by a Grand Jury". For example, the national Port Authority’s managing director was indicted by the Monteserrado County Grand Jury in July 2015, on charges of economic sabotage, theft of property and criminal conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;The Maritime Executive journal, see web site http://maritime-executive.com/article/liberian-grand-jury-indicts-port-director retrieved Jan 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand Jury in Liberia dates from the time of the original constitution in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Liberia, 1847, Sec 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
Under the administration of the [[Sierra Leone Company]], which began in 1792, the Governor and Council or any two members thereof, being also [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]], held [[quarter session]]s for the trial of offences committed within the colony. The process for indictment etc. was the same as the practice in England or as near as possible thereto. To effect this, they were empowered to issue their warrant or precept to the Sheriff, commanding him to summon a grand jury to sit at the court of quarter sessions. Grand juries continued in operation after the transfer to the colony to the Crown in 1807.&lt;ref name=CGeorge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of British West Africa: Comprising the Early History of the Colony of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lagos, Gold Coast, etc|first=Claude |last=George |publisher=Houlston &amp; sons |location=London |year=1904 |pages=146, 147, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Kennedy (governor)|Governor Kennedy]] (1852–1854) was concerned that jurors were frustrating government policy by being biased in certain cases; in particular he felt that liberated Africans on the grand jury would never convict another liberated African on charges of owning or importing slaves.&lt;ref name= BlackLoyalists&gt;{{cite book |title=The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783-1870 |first=James W.

Reports from Committees, Vol 5, Session 7 Feb-6 Jul 1865&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition was immediately mounted in [[Freetown]]. A public meeting launched a petition with 550 names to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] in London, and the opposition declared that the Kennedy ordinance was a reproach upon the loyalty of the community. Grand juries have been considered one colonial body representative of local opinion and the Colonial Secretary's support for Kennedy upholding the abolition inspired a round of agitation for a local voice in government decision-making.&lt;ref name= BlackLoyalists/&gt;

The '''Gunpowder Plot''' of 1605, in earlier centuries often called the '''Gunpowder Treason Plot''' or the '''Jesuit Treason''', was a failed assassination attempt against [[King James I]] by a group of provincial [[English Catholics]] led by [[Robert Catesby]].

The plan was to blow up the [[House of Lords]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]] on 5&amp;nbsp;November 1605{{efn|Dates are given according to the [[Julian calendar]], which was used in England until 1752.}}, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] during which James's nine-year-old daughter, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were [[John and Christopher Wright]], [[Robert and Thomas Wintour]], [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Robert Keyes]], [[Thomas Bates]], [[John Grant (Gunpowder Plot)|John Grant]], [[Ambrose Rookwood]], Sir [[Everard Digby]] and [[Francis Tresham]].  Fawkes, who had 10&amp;nbsp;years of military experience fighting in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the failed suppression of the [[Dutch Revolt]], was given charge of the explosives.

The plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]], on 26&amp;nbsp;October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords at about midnight on 4&amp;nbsp;November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36&amp;nbsp;barrels of [[gunpowder]]—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble—and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at [[Holbeche House]]; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27&amp;nbsp;January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].

Details of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal [[Jesuit]] of England, Father [[Henry Garnet]]. Although he was convicted of [[treason]] and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through [[Confession (religion)#Roman Catholicism|confession]], Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|absolute confidentiality of the confessional]]. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] of today.

==Background==

===Religion in England===
{{Main|English Reformation}}
{{See also|Roman Catholicism in England and Wales}}
[[File:Elizabeth I George Gower.jpg|thumb|alt=A three-quarter portrait of a middle-aged woman wearing a tiara, bodice, puffed-out sleeves, and a lace ruff.  The outfit is heavily decorated with patterns and jewels.  Her face is pale, her hair light brown.  The backdrop is mostly black.|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]]

Between 1533 and 1540, [[King Henry VIII]] took control of the English Church from Rome, the start of several decades of religious tension in England.  English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Church of England]].  Henry's daughter, [[Queen Elizabeth I]], responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for [[recusancy]], and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution.  Catholicism became marginalised, but despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession===
Queen Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, steadfastly refused to name an heir. Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was the legitimate heir to the English throne, but she was executed for treason in 1587.  The [[English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], negotiated secretly with Mary's son and successor, King [[James VI of Scotland]]. In the months before Elizabeth's death on 24&amp;nbsp;March 1603, Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her.{{efn|Salisbury wrote to James, "The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some exiled Catholics favoured [[Philip II of Spain]]'s daughter, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]], as Elizabeth's successor.  More moderate Catholics looked to James's and Elizabeth's cousin [[Arbella Stuart]], a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Elizabeth's health deteriorated, the government detained those they considered to be the "principal papists",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxv–xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Privy Council]] grew so worried that Arbella Stuart was moved closer to [[London]] to prevent her from being kidnapped by [[papist]]s.&lt;ref name="Fraserpxxv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite competing claims to the English throne, the transition of power following Elizabeth's death went smoothly.{{efn|The [[heir presumptive]] under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]], i.e. either [[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp]], or [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven]], depending on whether one recognised the legitimacy of the first-mentioned's birth; and  the Lady [[Arbella Stuart]] on grounds similar to James's own.}}  James's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24&amp;nbsp;March, which was generally celebrated.  Leading papists, rather than causing trouble as anticipated, reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch.  [[Jesuit]] priests, whose presence in England was punishable by death, also demonstrated their support for James, who was widely believed to embody "the natural order of things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxvii–xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain, and even though the two countries were still technically at war, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] sent his envoy, [[Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana|Don Juan de Tassis]], to congratulate James on his accession.&lt;ref name="Fraserp91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- James and Tassis first met 8 November, Fraser p94 --&gt;

For decades, the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir, but James arrived with a family and a clear line of succession.  His wife, [[Anne of Denmark]], was the daughter of a [[Frederick II of Denmark|king]].  Their eldest child, the nine-year-old [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]], was considered a handsome and confident boy, and their two younger children, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles]], were proof that James was able to provide heirs to continue the Protestant monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=70–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reign of James I===
[[File:James I, VI by John de Critz, c.1606.png|thumb|upright|alt=A full length portrait of a middle-aged man, wearing a grey doublet with grey tights, and brown fur draped over his shoulders.|King James, c. 1606&lt;br /&gt;(portrait by [[John de Critz]])]]

James's attitude towards Catholics was more moderate than that of his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant. He promised that he would not "persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brice|1994|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment: "I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxx–xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James received an envoy from [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]],&lt;ref name="Fraserp91"/&gt; ruler of the remaining Catholic territories in the Netherlands after over 30&amp;nbsp;years of war in the [[Dutch Revolt]] by English-supported Protestant rebels.  For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed [[Spanish invasion of England]] in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 16th century, Catholics made several assassination attempts on Protestant rulers in Europe and in England, including plans to poison Elizabeth I. The Jesuit [[Juan de Mariana]]'s 1598 ''On Kings and the Education of Kings'' explicitly justified the assassination of the French king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]—who had been stabbed to death by [[Jacques Clément|a Catholic fanatic]] in 1589—and until the 1620s, some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power.&lt;ref name=MarshallP227&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the "rather nervous"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; James I's political writing was "concerned with the threat of Catholic assassination and refutation of the [Catholic] argument that 'faith did not need to be kept with heretics'".&lt;ref name=MarshallP228&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early plots===
In the absence of any sign that James would move to end the persecution of Catholics, as some had hoped for, several members of the [[clergy]] (including two anti-Jesuit priests) decided to take matters into their own hands.  In what became known as the [[Bye Plot]], the priests [[William Watson (priest)|William Watson]] and [[William Clark (priest)|William Clark]] planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the [[Archpriest]] [[George Blackwell]], who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], [[Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]], [[Griffin Markham]] and [[Walter Raleigh]] hatched what became known as the [[Main Plot]], which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with [[Arbella Stuart]].  Amongst others, they approached [[Henry IV of France]] for funding, but were unsuccessful.  All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603; [[George Brooke (conspirator)|Sir George Brooke]] was executed, but James, keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign, reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold.  Raleigh, who had watched while his colleagues sweated, and who was due to be executed a few days later, was also pardoned.  Arbella Stuart denied any knowledge of the Main Plot.  The two priests, condemned by the pope, and "very bloodily handled", were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=32–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic community responded to news of these plots with shock. That the Bye Plot had been revealed by Catholics was instrumental in saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19&amp;nbsp;February 1604, shortly after he discovered that his wife, Queen Anne, had been sent a [[rosary]] from the pope via one of James's spies,{{efn|Historians are divided on when and if Anne converted to Catholicism.  "Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "... Sir John Lindsay went to Rome in November 1604 and had an audience with the pope at which he revealed that the queen was already a Catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Catholic foreign ambassadors—who would surely have welcomed such a situation—were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne&amp;nbsp;... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible'. Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life—even after her death—they remained obfuscated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogge|2005|pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Sir Anthony Standen, James denounced the Catholic Church.  Three days later, he ordered all Jesuits and all other Catholic priests to leave the country, and reimposed the collection of fines for recusancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James changed his focus from the anxieties of English Catholics to the establishment of an Anglo-Scottish union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also appointed Scottish nobles such as [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|George Home]] to his court, which proved unpopular with the [[Parliament of England]].  Some Members of Parliament made it clear that in their view, the "effluxion of people from the Northern parts" was unwelcome, and compared them to "plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one".  Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were 5,560&amp;nbsp;convicted of recusancy in 1605, of whom 112&amp;nbsp;were landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined £20 per month.  Those of more moderate means had to pay two-thirds of their annual rental income; middle class recusants were fined one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] a week, although the collection of all these fines was "haphazard and negligent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When James came to power, almost £5,000 a year (equivalent to over £10&amp;nbsp;million in 2008) was being raised by these fines.{{efn|Comparing relative [[purchasing power]] of £5,000 in 1605 with 2008.}}&lt;ref name=MeasuringWorth&gt;{{citation |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present |publisher=MeasuringWorth |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/index.php |year=2009 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124192556/http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/index.php |archivedate=24 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19&amp;nbsp;March, the King gave his opening speech to his first English Parliament in which he spoke of his desire to secure peace, but only by "profession of the true religion".  He also spoke of a Christian union and reiterated his desire to avoid religious persecution.  For the Catholics, the King's speech made it clear that they were not to "increase their number and strength in this Kingdom", that "they might be in hope to erect their Religion again".  To [[John Gerard (Jesuit)|Father John Gerard]], these words were almost certainly responsible for the heightened levels of persecution the members of his faith now suffered, and for the priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] they were a rebuttal&lt;!--not repudiation?--&gt; of the early claims that the King had made, upon which the papists had built their hopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A week after James's speech, [[Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Lord Sheffield]] informed the king of over 900&amp;nbsp;recusants brought before the [[Assizes]] in Normanby, and on 24&amp;nbsp;April a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced in Parliament which threatened to outlaw all English followers of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Eliz bohemia 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Painting|King James's daughter Elizabeth, whom the conspirators planned to install on the throne as a Catholic queen. Portrait by [[Robert Peake the Elder]], [[National Maritime Museum]].]]
The conspirators' principal aim was to kill King James, but many other important targets would also be present at the State Opening, including the monarch's nearest relatives and members of the [[Privy Council]]. The senior judges of the English legal system, most of the Protestant aristocracy, and the bishops of the [[Church of England]] would all have attended in their capacity as members of the House of Lords, along with the members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important objective was the kidnapping of the King's daughter, Elizabeth.  Housed at [[Coombe Abbey]] near [[Coventry]], she lived only ten miles north of Warwick—convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.  The fate of her brothers, Henry and Charles, would be improvised; their role in state ceremonies was, as yet, uncertain.  The plotters planned to use [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]], as Elizabeth's [[regent]], but most likely never informed him of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial recruitment===
[[Robert Catesby]] (1573–1605), a man of "ancient, historic and distinguished lineage", was the inspiration behind the plot.  He was described by contemporaries as "a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman".  Along with several other conspirators, he took part in the [[Essex Rebellion]] in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured.  Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000&amp;nbsp;[[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]] (equivalent to more than £6&amp;nbsp;million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in [[Chastleton]].{{efn|Comparing relative average earnings of £3,000 in 1601 with 2008.}}&lt;ref name=MeasuringWorth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NorthcotePP44-46" /&gt;  In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics.  [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]] (1571–1606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that "3,000 Catholics" were ready and waiting to support such an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concern was voiced by [[Pope Clement VIII]] that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to contemporary accounts,{{efn|Some of the information in these accounts would have been given under pain or threat of torture, and may also have been subject to government interference, and should therefore be viewed with caution.}} in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in [[Lambeth]], where they discussed Catesby's plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.&lt;ref name="NorthcotePP44-46" /&gt;   Wintour was known as a competent scholar, able to speak several languages, and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His uncle, [[Francis Ingleby]], had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586, and Wintour later converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp5961"/&gt;  Also present at the meeting was [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]], a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day, and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex's rebellion three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail, Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy, perhaps persuaded by Catesby's rhetoric: "Let us give the attempt and where it faileth, pass no further."&lt;ref name="NorthcotePP44-46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support.  While there he sought out [[Guy Fawkes]] (1570–1606), a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the [[Southern Netherlands]] under the command of [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]], and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=84–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accompanied by John Wright's brother Christopher, Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England.  Wintour told Fawkes that "some good frends of his wished his company in Ingland", and that certain gentlemen "were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott".  The two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely.  Thomas Percy, Catesby's friend and John Wright's brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later.&lt;ref name="ODNB Thomas Wintour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NorthcotePP46-47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Percy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596 was his agent for the family's northern estates.  About 1600–1601 he served with his patron in the [[Low Countries]].  At some point during Northumberland's command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Percy was reputedly a "serious" character who had converted to the Catholic faith.  His early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on "his sword and personal courage".&lt;ref name="Fraserp49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Northumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James I in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth I.  Thomas Percy's meetings with James seemed to go well.  Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics,&lt;!-- At the same time James was making similar noises to the Puritans p51 --&gt; and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.  Percy, keen to improve his standing, went further, claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial planning===
[[File:The Gunpowder Plot Conspirators, 1605 from NPG.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Engraving|A contemporary engraving of eight of the thirteen conspirators, by [[Crispijn van de Passe]].  Missing are Digby, Keyes, Rookwood, Grant, and Tresham.]]
The first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20&amp;nbsp;May 1604, probably at the Duck and Drake Inn, just off the [[Strand, London|Strand]], Thomas Wintour's usual residence when staying in London. Catesby, Thomas Wintour, and John Wright were in attendance, joined by Guy Fawkes and [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alone in a private room, the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book.  By coincidence, and ignorant of the plot, Father John Gerard (a friend of Catesby's) was celebrating Mass in another room, and the five men subsequently received the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p121, this coincidence would later be used against the Jesuits --&gt;

===Further recruitment===
Following their oath, the plotters left London and returned to their homes.  The adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.  On 9&amp;nbsp;June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], a [[cavalry|mounted troop]] of 50&amp;nbsp;bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.  Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] and [[John Hippisley (Parliamentarian)|John Hippisley]].  Fawkes, using the pseudonym "John Johnson", took charge of the building, posing as Percy's servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby's lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, King James continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John rocque house of lords gunpowder plot cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=The medieval House of Lords was part of a complex of buildings alongside the north bank of the River Thames, in London.  The building which the plotters planned to destroy was at the southern end of the complex of Parliamentary buildings, alongside a minor alley that led to a staircase known as Parliament Stairs.|The House of Lords (highlighted in red) on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|John Rocque's 1746 map of London]], within the [[Palace of Westminster#Old Palace|Old Palace of Westminster]]]]

The conspirators returned to London in October 1604, when [[Robert Keyes]], a "desperate man, ruined and indebted", was admitted to the group.&lt;ref name=NorthcoteParkinsonP96&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His responsibility was to take charge of Catesby's house in Lambeth, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored.  Keyes's family had notable connections; his wife's employer was the Catholic [[Henry Mordaunt, 4th Baron Mordaunt|Lord Mordaunt]].  Tall, with a red beard, he was seen as trustworthy and, like Fawkes, capable of looking after himself.  In December{{efn|According to his confession.}} Catesby recruited his servant, [[Thomas Bates]], into the plot,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the latter accidentally became aware of it.&lt;ref name=NorthcoteParkinsonP96 /&gt;

It was announced on 24&amp;nbsp;December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed. Concern over the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3&amp;nbsp;October 1605.  The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.  This may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.  The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession,&lt;ref name="ODNB Thomas Wintour"/&gt; and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.  Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the story is true, by 6&amp;nbsp;December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.  They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.  The noise turned out to be the then-tenant's widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords—the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the plotters reconvened at the start of the [[Old Style and New Style dates|old style]] new year on [[Lady Day]], 25&amp;nbsp;March, three more had been admitted to their ranks;&lt;!-- admitted in January, Haynes p57 --&gt; [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Robert Wintour]], [[John Grant (Gunpowder Plot)|John Grant]], and [[John and Christopher Wright|Christopher Wright]].  The additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices.  Along with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited [[Huddington Court]] (a known refuge for priests) near [[Worcester]], and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man.  A devout Catholic, he married Gertrude, the daughter of [[John Talbot of Grafton|John Talbot]] of [[Grafton Manor|Grafton]], a prominent Worcestershire family of recusants.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp5961"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christopher Wright (1568–1605), John's brother, had also taken part in the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]'s revolt and had moved his family to [[Twigmore]] in [[Lincolnshire]], then known as something of a haven for priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nelthorpe |first=Sutton |title=Twigmore and the Gunpowder Plot |journal=Lincolnshire Magazine |volume=2|issue=8 |date=November–December 1935 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Grant was married to Wintour's sister, Dorothy, and was [[lord of the manor]] of Norbrook near [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. Reputed to be an intelligent, thoughtful man, he sheltered Catholics at his home at [[Snitterfield]], and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undercroft===
In addition, 25&amp;nbsp;March was the day on which the plotters purchased the lease to the [[undercroft]] they had supposedly tunnelled near to, owned by John Whynniard.  The [[Palace of Westminster]] in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.  The old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops and taverns within its precincts.  Whynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the [[River Thames]]. Undercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood. Whynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen.  Unused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second week of June Catesby met in London the principal [[Jesuit]] in England, Father [[Henry Garnet]], and asked him about the morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent, together with the guilty.  Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion.  Soon after, the Jesuit priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession,{{efn|Haynes (2005) writes that Tesimond took Thomas Bates' confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.  Garnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24&amp;nbsp;July 1605, at the house of the wealthy catholic [[Anne Vaux]] in [[Enfield Chase]].{{efn|Anne Vaux was related to Catesby, and to most of the other plotters.  Her home was often used to hide priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Garnet decided that Tesimond's account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Garnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, [[Claudio Acquaviva]], expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England.  He also told Acquaviva that "there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fawkes, 20&amp;nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&amp;nbsp;more on 20&amp;nbsp;July. The supply of gunpowder was theoretically controlled by the government, but it was easily obtained from illicit sources.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp146147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Gunpowder could be purchased on the black market from soldiers, militia, merchant vessels, and powdermills.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp146147"/&gt;}}  On 28&amp;nbsp;July, the ever-present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament, this time until Tuesday 5&amp;nbsp;November.  Fawkes left the country for a short time. The King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.  He stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.  Garnet, convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded, travelled the country on a [[pilgrimage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=159–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.  More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605.  At [[Michaelmas]], Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic [[Ambrose Rookwood]] to rent [[Clopton House]] near Stratford-upon-Avon.  Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at [[Coldham Hall]] in [[Stanningfield]], [[Suffolk]] was an important factor in his enlistment.  His parents, [[Robert Rookwood]] and [[Dorothea Drury]], were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near [[Calais]].  [[Everard Digby]] was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at [[Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire|Gayhurst House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].  He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.  Digby and his wife, [[Mary Mulshaw]], had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.  Digby was asked by Catesby to rent [[Coughton Court]] near [[Alcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=159–162, 168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digby also promised £1,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, on 14&amp;nbsp;October Catesby invited [[Francis Tresham]] into the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tresham was the son of the Catholic [[Thomas Tresham II|Thomas Tresham]], and a cousin to Robert Catesby—the two had been raised together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also the heir to his father's large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby's involvement in the Essex revolt.{{efn|Thomas Tresham had paid Francis's fine in full and part of Catesby's fine.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=79–80, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law and cousin, [[Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton|Lord Stourton]].  In his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done.  Catesby also apparently asked for £2,000, and the use of [[Rushton Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].  Tresham declined both offers (although he did give £100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.&lt;!-- guilty of concealment but not an active participant --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monteagle letter===
[[File:Monteagle letter.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|alt=A damaged and aged piece of paper, or parchment, with multiple lines of handwritten English text.|An anonymous letter, sent to William Parker, {{nowrap|4th Baron Monteagle}}, was instrumental in revealing the plot's existence.  Its author's identity has never been reliably established, although Francis Tresham has long been a suspect. Monteagle himself has been considered responsible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=182–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The details of the plot were finalised in October, in a series of taverns across London and [[Daventry]].{{efn|The playwright [[Ben Jonson]] was present at one of these parties, and following the discovery of the plot was forced to work hard at distancing himself from the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Fawkes would be left to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of the King's daughter, Elizabeth.  Fawkes would leave for the continent, to explain events in England to the European Catholic powers.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999 178–179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wives of those involved and [[Anne Vaux]] (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the conspirators expressed worries about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]]'s name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day.  The Lords Vaux, [[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu|Montague]], [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle|Monteagle]], and Stourton were also mentioned.  Keyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer, to derision from Catesby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 26&amp;nbsp;October, Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in [[Hoxton]].  Having broken the seal, he handed the letter to a servant who read it aloud:

{{quote|My Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a care of your preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift your attendance at this parliament; for God and man hath concurred to punish the wickedness of this time.  And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself into your country where you may expect the event in safety.  For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them.  This counsel is not to be condemned because it may do you good and can do you no harm; for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the letter.  And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it, to whose holy protection I commend you.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Uncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle promptly rode to [[Whitehall]] and handed it to Cecil (then [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salisbury informed the [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]], considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]], but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days.  Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal.  Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator.  Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved.  He therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
The letter was shown to the King on Friday 1 November following his arrival back in London. Upon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word "blow" and felt that it hinted at "some strategem of fire and powder",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], at [[Kirk o' Field]] in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the [[Palace of Whitehall]] and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the [[Lord Chamberlain]] [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]] would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, "both above and below".  On Sunday 3&amp;nbsp;November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should "abide the uttermost triall", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 4&amp;nbsp;November Digby was ensconced with a "hunting party" at [[Dunchurch]], ready to abduct Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland—who was uninvolved in the conspiracy—to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle.  Percy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray's Inn Road.  That same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands.  Fawkes visited Keyes, and was given a [[pocket watch]] left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local [[Cutlery|cutler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4&amp;nbsp;November—as the plotters were busy making their final preparations—by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard.  They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy.  They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building.  The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator.  The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken.  Late that night, the search party, headed by [[Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet|Thomas Knyvet]], returned to the undercroft.  They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs.  He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson.  He was carrying a lantern now held in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://britisharchaeology.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/highlights/guy-fawkes-lantern.html |last=MacGregor |first=Arthur |date=January 2012 |title=Guy Fawkes's Lantern |work=British Archaeology at the Ashmolean Museum |publisher=britisharchaeology.ashmus.ox.ac.uk |location=Tradescant Gallery, Gallery 27, First Floor, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England |accessdate=19 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107194310/http://britisharchaeology.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/highlights/guy-fawkes-lantern.html |archive-date=7 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several [[slow match]]es and touchwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of [[Faggot (unit)|faggots]] and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight===
As news of "John Johnson's" arrest spread among the plotters still in London, most fled northwest, along [[Watling Street]].  Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together.  Rookwood left soon after, and managed to cover 30&amp;nbsp;miles in two hours on one horse.  He overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at [[Little Brickhill]], before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road.  Reunited, the group continued northwest to [[Dunchurch]], using horses provided by Digby.  Keyes went to Mordaunt's house at [[Drayton, Northamptonshire|Drayton]].  Meanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster to see what was happening. When he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister's house at [[Norbrook]], before continuing to [[Huddington Court]].{{efn|[[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Robert Wintour]] inherited [[Huddington Court]] near [[Worcester]], along with a small fortune.  The building became a refuge for priests, and secret Masses were often celebrated there.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp5961"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Fraserpp203206"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box | quote=On the 5th of November we began our Parliament, to which the King should have come in person, but refrained through a practise but that morning discovered. The plot was to have blown up the King at such time as he should have been set on his Royal Throne, accompanied with all his Children, Nobility and Commoners and assisted with all Bishops, Judges and Doctors; at one instant and blast to have ruin'd the whole State and Kingdom of England. And for the effecting of this, there was placed under the Parliament House, where the king should sit, some 30&amp;nbsp;barrels of powder, with good store of wood, faggots, pieces and bars of iron.|source = Extract of a letter from Sir Edward Hoby ([[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]]) to Sir Thomas Edwards, Ambassador at Brussells {{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nichols|1828|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=left|width=33%}}

The group of six conspirators stopped at [[Ashby St Ledgers]] at about 6&amp;nbsp;pm, where they met Robert Wintour and updated him on their situation.  They then continued on to Dunchurch, and met with Digby.  Catesby convinced him that despite the plot's failure, an armed struggle was still a real possibility.  He announced to Digby's "hunting party" that the King and Salisbury were dead, before the fugitives moved west to Warwick.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp203206"/&gt;

In London, news of the plot was spreading, and the authorities set extra guards on the [[London Wall|city gates]], closed the ports, and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador, which was surrounded by an angry mob.  An arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy, and his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, was placed under house arrest.&lt;ref name="Fraserp226"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "John Johnson's" initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother, and that he was from Yorkshire.  A letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person, but he claimed that name was one of his aliases.  Far from denying his intentions, "Johnson" stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament.{{efn|As King James put it, Fawkes intended the destruction "not only&amp;nbsp;... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Nevertheless, he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone.  His unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing "a Roman resolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=207–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

===Investigation===
[[File:A Torture Rack.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Photo|A [[Rack (torture)|torture rack]] in the Tower of London]]
On 6 November, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir [[John Popham (judge)|John Popham]] (a man with a deep-seated hatred of Catholics) questioned Rookwood's servants.  By the evening he had learned the names of several of those involved in the conspiracy: Catesby, Rookwood, Keyes, Wynter {{sic}}, John and Christopher Wright, and Grant.  "Johnson" meanwhile persisted with his story, and along with the gunpowder he was found with,{{efn|The gunpowder was moved to the [[Tower of London]], where it was described as "decayed".&lt;ref name="Fraserp226"/&gt;}} was moved to the [[Tower of London]], where the King had decided that "Johnson" would be [[torture]]d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of torture was forbidden, except by royal prerogative or a body such as the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] or [[Star Chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1940|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter of 6&amp;nbsp;November James wrote: "The gentler tortours [tortures] are to be first used unto him, ''et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur'' [and thus by steps extended to the bottom depths], and so God speed your good work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Johnson" may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall, but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the [[Rack (torture)|rack]].  On 7&amp;nbsp;November his resolve was broken; he confessed late that day, and again over the following two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1940|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last stand===
On 6&amp;nbsp;November, with Fawkes maintaining his silence, the fugitives raided [[Warwick Castle]] for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons.  From there they continued their journey to Huddington.  Bates left the group and travelled to [[Coughton Court]] to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.  Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their "wicked actions", before himself fleeing.  Several priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.  They were caught, and then imprisoned in London.  Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.  They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason.  They continued on to [[Holbeche House]] on the border of [[Staffordshire]], the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to 'Pepperhill', the Shropshire residence of [[John Talbot of Grafton|Sir John Talbot]] to gain support but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out.  Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died.  At that point, Littleton left, but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive, albeit scorched.  John Grant was not so lucky, and had been blinded by the fire.  Digby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left.  Of the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, and the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy, remained.  The fugitives resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the King's men.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp222225"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=222–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Walsh (English politician)|Richard Walsh]] ([[High Sheriff of Worcestershire|Sheriff of Worcestershire]]) and his company of 200&amp;nbsp;men besieged Holbeche House on the morning of 8&amp;nbsp;November.  Thomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder while crossing the courtyard.  John Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood.  Catesby and Percy were reportedly killed by a single lucky shot.  The attackers rushed the property, and stripped the dead or dying defenders of their clothing.  Grant, Morgan, Rookwood, and Wintour were arrested.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp222225"/&gt;

Bates and Keyes were captured shortly after Holbeche House was taken.  Digby, who had intended to give himself up, was caught by a small group of pursuers.  Tresham was arrested on 12&amp;nbsp;November, and taken to the Tower three days later.  Montague, Mordaunt, and Stourton (Tresham's brother-in-law) were also imprisoned in the Tower.

The foiling of the Gunpowder Plot initiated a wave of national relief at the delivery of the King and his sons, and inspired in the ensuing parliament a mood of loyalty and goodwill, which Salisbury astutely exploited to extract higher subsidies for the King than any (bar one) granted in Elizabeth I's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Croft|2003|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Raleigh, who was languishing in the Tower owing to his involvement in the [[Main Plot]], and whose wife was a first cousin of Lady Catesby, declared he had had no knowledge of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bishop of Rochester gave a sermon at St. Paul's Cross, in which he condemned the plot.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp232233"/&gt;  In his speech to both Houses on 9&amp;nbsp;November, James expounded on two emerging preoccupations of his monarchy: the [[divine right of kings]] and the Catholic question.  He insisted that the plot had been the work of only a few Catholics, not of the English Catholics as a whole,{{efn|James said that it did not follow "that all professing that Romish religion were guilty of the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival, since kings were divinely appointed and he owed his escape to a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salisbury wrote to his English ambassadors abroad, informing them of what had occurred, and also reminding them that the King bore no ill will to his Catholic neighbours.  The foreign powers largely distanced themselves from the plotters, calling them atheists and Protestant heretics.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp232233"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrogations===
[[File:Guy Fawkes confession.png|left|thumb|alt=A small irregular section of parchment upon which several lines of handwritten text are visible. Several elaborate signatures bookend the text, at the bottom.|Part of a confession by Guy Fawkes. His weak signature, made soon after his torture, is faintly visible under the word "good" (lower right).]]
Sir [[Edward Coke]] was in charge of the interrogations.  Over a period of about ten weeks, in the Lieutenant's Lodgings at the Tower of London (now known as the Queen's House) he questioned those who had been implicated in the plot.  For the first round of interrogations, no real proof exists that these people were tortured, although on several occasions Salisbury certainly suggested that they should be.  Coke later revealed that the threat of torture was in most cases enough to elicit a confession from those caught up in the aftermath of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two confessions were printed in full: Fawkes's confession of 8&amp;nbsp;November, and Wintour's of 23&amp;nbsp;November.  Having been involved in the conspiracy from the start (unlike Fawkes), Wintour was able to give extremely valuable information to the Privy Council.  The handwriting on his testimony is almost certainly that of the man himself, but his signature was markedly different.  Wintour had previously only ever signed his name as such, but his confession is signed "Winter", and since he had been shot in the shoulder, the steady hand used to write the signature may indicate some measure of government interference—or it may indicate that writing a shorter version of his name was less painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wintour's testimony makes no mention of his brother, Robert.  Both were published in the so-called ''King's Book'', a hastily written official account of the conspiracy published in late November 1605.&lt;ref name="ODNB Thomas Wintour"&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Winter, Thomas (c.&amp;nbsp;1571–1606) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29767 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/29767 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123416/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29767 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, was in a difficult position.  His midday dinner with Thomas Percy on 4&amp;nbsp;November was damning evidence against him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after Thomas Percy's death there was nobody who could either implicate him or clear him.  The Privy Council suspected that Northumberland would have been Princess Elizabeth's protector had the plot succeeded, but there was insufficient evidence to convict him.  Northumberland remained in the Tower and on 27&amp;nbsp;June 1606 was finally charged with contempt.  He was stripped of all public offices, fined £30,000 (about £{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|30000|1606|r=-5}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and kept in the Tower until June 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Percy, Henry, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564–1632) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21939 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/21939 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111061010/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21939 |archive-date=11 November 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lords Mordaunt and Stourton were tried in the [[Star Chamber]].

Both were also given significant fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other people not involved in the conspiracy, but known or related to the conspirators, were also questioned.  Northumberland's brothers, Sir Allen and Sir Josceline, were arrested.  [[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu]] had employed Fawkes at an early age, and had also met Catesby on 29&amp;nbsp;October, and was therefore of interest; he was released several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Agnes Wenman]] was from a Catholic family, and related to Elizabeth Vaux.{{efn|Vaux had written a letter to Wenman regarding the marriage of her son Edward Vaux.

Thomas Bates confessed on 4&amp;nbsp;December, providing much of the information that Salisbury needed to link the Catholic clergy to the plot.  Bates had been present at most of the conspirators' meetings, and under interrogation he implicated Father Tesimond in the plot.  On 13&amp;nbsp;January 1606 he described how he had visited Garnet and Tesimond on 7&amp;nbsp;November to inform Garnet of the plot's failure.  Bates also told his interrogators of his ride with Tesimond to Huddington, before the priest left him to head for the Habingtons at Hindlip Hall, and of a meeting between Garnet, Gerard, and Tesimond in October 1605.  At about the same time in December, Tresham's health began to deteriorate.  He was visited regularly by his wife, a nurse, and his servant William Vavasour, who documented his [[strangury]].  Before he died Tresham had also told of Garnet's involvement with the 1603 mission to Spain, but in his last hours he retracted some of these statements.  Nowhere in his confession did he mention the Monteagle letter.  He died early on the morning of 23&amp;nbsp;December, and was buried in the Tower.  Nevertheless he was attainted along with the other plotters, his head was set on a pike either at Northampton or London Bridge, and his estates confiscated.&lt;!-- Fraser says his estate went to his brother p253 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |chapter=Tresham, Francis (1567?–1605) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27708 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/27708 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105224523/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27708 |archive-date=5 January 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days earlier, on 9&amp;nbsp;January, Robert Wintour and Stephen Littleton were captured.  Their hiding place at [[Hagley]], the home of [[Humphrey Littleton]] (brother of MP [[John Lyttelton (MP)|John Littleton]], imprisoned for treason in 1601 for his part in the Essex revolt)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; was betrayed by a cook, who grew suspicious of the amount of food sent up for his master's consumption.  Humphrey denied the presence of the two fugitives, but another servant led the authorities to their hiding place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20&amp;nbsp;January the local Justice and his retainers arrived at Thomas Habington's home, Hindlip Hall, to arrest the Jesuits.  Despite Thomas Habington's protests, the men spent the next four days searching the house.  On 24&amp;nbsp;January, starving, two priests left their hiding places and were discovered.  Humphrey Littleton, who had escaped from the authorities at Hagley, got as far as [[Prestwood (Kinver)|Prestwood]] in [[Staffordshire]] before he was captured.  He was imprisoned, and then condemned to death at [[Worcester]].  On 26&amp;nbsp;January, in exchange for his life, he told the authorities where they could find Father Garnet.  Worn down by hiding for so long, Garnet, accompanied by another priest, emerged from his [[priest hole]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=256–257, 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trials===
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of a man dressed in black with a white lace ruff|[[Edward Coke]] conducted the interrogations of those thought to be involved with the conspiracy.]]
By coincidence, on the same day that Garnet was found, the surviving conspirators were [[arraignment|arraigned]] in [[Westminster Hall]].  Seven of the prisoners were taken from the Tower to the [[Star Chamber]] by barge.  Bates, who was considered lower class, was brought from the [[Gatehouse Prison]].  Some of the prisoners were reportedly despondent, but others were nonchalant, even smoking tobacco.  The King and his family, hidden from view, were among the many who watched the trial.  The Lords Commissioners present were the Earls of [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Suffolk]], Worcester, Northampton, [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire|Devonshire]], and Salisbury.  [[John Popham (judge)|Sir John Popham]] was [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], Sir [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]] was [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], and two Justices, Sir [[Thomas Walmsley (judge)|Thomas Walmsley]] and Sir Peter Warburton, sat as [[List of Justices of the Court of Common Pleas|Justices of the Common Pleas]].  The list of traitors' names was read aloud, beginning with those of the priests: Garnet, Tesimond, and Gerard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynespp110111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to speak was the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] (later [[Master of the Rolls]]), Sir [[Edward Phelips (speaker)|Edward Philips]], who described the intent behind the plot in lurid detail.&lt;ref name="Haynespp110111"/&gt;  He was followed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] Sir [[Edward Coke]], who began with a long speech—the content of which was heavily influenced by Salisbury—that included a denial that the King had ever made any promises to the Catholics.  Monteagle's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed, and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly.  Fawkes's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke's speech.  The foreign powers, when mentioned, were accorded due respect, but the priests were accursed, their behaviour analysed and criticised wherever possible.  There was little doubt, according to Coke, that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits.  Garnet's meeting with Catesby, at which the former was said to have absolved the latter of any blame in the plot, was proof enough that the Jesuits were central to the conspiracy;&lt;ref name="Fraserpp266269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=266–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  according to Coke the Gunpowder Plot would always be known as the Jesuit Treason.&lt;ref name=WilsonP136&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coke spoke with feeling of the probable fate of the Queen and the rest of the King's family, and of the innocents who would have been caught up in the explosion.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp266269"/&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=I never yet knew a treason without a Romish priest; but in this there are very many Jesuits, who are known to have dealt and passed through the whole action.| source=[[Sir Edward Coke]]&lt;ref name="Haynespp110111"/&gt;|width=33%|align=left}}

Each of the condemned, said Coke, would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground.  He was to be "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both".  His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed.  Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed so that they might become "prey for the fowls of the air".&lt;ref name="Fraserpp266269"/&gt;  [[Confession (law)|Confessions]] and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak.  Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, "whom he loved above any worldy man".  Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared.  Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.  Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as "a conspiracy intended but never effected".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment,&lt;ref name="Haynespp110111"/&gt; pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions.  He sought [[death by the axe]] and begged mercy from the King for his young family.&lt;ref name="ODNB Everard Digby"&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |chapter=Digby, Sir Everard (c. 1578–1606) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7626 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7626 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161927/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7626 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the [[jury]] of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]].  Digby shouted "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows."  The response was short: "God forgive you, and we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnet may have been questioned on as many as 23&amp;nbsp;occasions.  His response to the threat of the rack was "''Minare ista pueris'' [Threats are only for boys]",{{efn|Haynes (2005) appears to have misspelt this as ''Minute ista pueris''.}} and he denied having encouraged Catholics to pray for the success of the "Catholic Cause".  His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics, but to no avail.  His jailers then allowed him to talk with another priest in a neighbouring cell, with eavesdroppers listening to every word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually Garnet let slip a crucial piece of information, that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot. Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] on 28&amp;nbsp;March, in a trial lasting from 8&amp;nbsp;am until 7&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coke, Garnet instigated the plot: "[Garnet] hath many gifts and endowments of nature, by art learned, a good linguist and, by profession, a Jesuit and a [[Superior (hierarchy)|Superior]] as indeed he is Superior to all his predecessors in devilish treason, a Doctor of Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Disposing of Kingdoms, Daunting and deterring of subjects, and Destruction."  Garnet refuted all the charges against him, and explained the Catholic position on such matters, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="ODNB Garnett"/&gt;{{Clear}}

Digby, the first to mount the scaffold, asked the spectators for forgiveness, and refused the attentions of a Protestant clergyman.  He was stripped of his clothing, and wearing only a shirt, climbed the ladder to place his head through the noose.  He was quickly cut down, and while still fully conscious was castrated, disembowelled, and then quartered, along with the three other prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, and Guy Fawkes were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], opposite the building they had planned to blow up, in the [[Old Palace Yard]] at Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |chapter=Rookwood, Ambrose (c.&amp;nbsp;1578–1606) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24066 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/24066}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keyes did not wait for the hangman's command and jumped from the gallows, but he survived the drop and was led to the quartering block.

[[File:Sheares Bible Gunpowder Plot.jpg|thumb|"The Gunpowder Treason" in a Protestant Bible of the 18th century.]]
Greater freedom for Roman Catholics to worship as they chose seemed unlikely in 1604, but the discovery of such a wide-ranging conspiracy, the capture of those involved, and the subsequent trials, led Parliament to consider introducing new anti-Catholic legislation. The event also destroyed all hope that the Spanish would ever secure tolerance of the Catholics in England.&lt;ref name="Allen154"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Paul C|title=Philip III and the Pax Hispanica, 1598–1621: The Failure of Grand Strategy|page=154|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300076820}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1606, laws against recusancy were strengthened; the [[Popish Recusants Act 1605|Popish Recusants Act]] returned England to the Elizabethan system of fines and restrictions, introduced a sacramental test, and an Oath of Allegiance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring Catholics to abjure as a "heresy" the doctrine that "princes excommunicated by the Pope could be deposed or assassinated".&lt;ref name=MarshallP227 /&gt; [[Catholic Emancipation]] took another 200&amp;nbsp;years, but many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no "golden time" of "toleration" of Catholics, which Father Garnet had hoped for, James's reign was nevertheless a period of relative leniency for Catholics, and few were subject to prosecution.&lt;ref name="MarshallPP187-188" /&gt;

The playwright [[William Shakespeare]] had already used the family history of Northumberland's family in his ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' series of plays, and the events of the Gunpowder Plot seem to have featured alongside the earlier [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Gowrie conspiracy]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'', written some time between 1603 and 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=148–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in the [[Demonology|demonic]] was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot. The King had become engaged in the great debate about other-worldly powers in writing his ''Daemonology'' in 1597, before he became King of England as well as Scotland.  Inversions seen in such lines as "fair is foul and foul is fair" are used frequently, and another possible reference to the plot relates to the use of [[equivocation]]; Garnett's ''A Treatise of Equivocation'' was found on one of the plotters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Huntley |first=Frank L. |title=Macbeth and the Background of Jesuitical Equivocation |jstor=460744 |journal=PMLA |publisher=Modern Language Association |volume=79 |number=4 |date=September 1964 |pages=390–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another writer influenced by the plot was [[John Milton]], who in 1626 wrote what one commentator has called a "critically vexing poem", ''[[In Quintum Novembris]]''.  Reflecting "partisan public sentiment on an English-Protestant national holiday",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Demaray|1984|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the published editions of 1645 and 1673 the poem is preceded by five [[epigram]]s on the subject of the Gunpowder Plot, apparently written by Milton in preparation for the larger work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Demaray|1984|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plot may also have influenced his later work, ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Quint |first=David |title=Milton, Fletcher and the Gunpowder Plot |year=1991 |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=54 |pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote = Faith, here's an equivocator, &lt;br&gt;that could swear in both the scales against either scale; &lt;br&gt;who committed treason enough for God's sake, &lt;br&gt;yet could not equivocate to heaven| source = ''[[Macbeth]]'', Act 2 Scene 3 | align = left}}
The Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for years by special sermons and other public acts, such as the ringing of church bells. It added to an increasingly full calendar of Protestant celebrations that contributed to the national and religious life of 17th-century England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cressy|1989|p=n/a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has evolved into the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] of today.  In ''What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded?'' historian [[Ronald Hutton]] considered the events which might have followed a successful implementation of the plot, and the destruction of the House of Lords and all those within it.  He concluded that a severe backlash against suspected Catholics would have followed, and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely; despite differing religious convictions, most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy.  England might have become a more "Puritan absolute monarchy", as "existed in Sweden, Denmark, [[Saxony]], and [[Prussia]] in the seventeenth century", rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did.&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;{{citation | last=Hutton | first=Ronald | title=What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded? | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=1 April 2001 | accessdate=7 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109062537/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | archive-date=9 January 2009 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of state conspiracy===
Many at the time felt that Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation. Such [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] alleged that Salisbury had either actually invented the plot or allowed it to continue when his agents had already infiltrated it, for the purposes of propaganda.&lt;ref name="MarshallPP187-188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|2003|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popish Plot]] of 1678 sparked renewed interest in the Gunpowder Plot, resulting in a book by [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]], Bishop of Lincoln, which refuted "a bold and groundless surmise that all this was a contrivance of Secretary Cecil".&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonp118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 Father John Gerard of [[Stonyhurst College]], namesake of [[John Gerard (Jesuit)|John Gerard]] (who, following the plot's discovery, had evaded capture), wrote an account called ''What was the Gunpowder Plot?'', alleging Salisbury's culpability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gerard|first=John|title=What was the Gunpowder Plot? : the traditional story tested by original evidence|publisher=Osgood, McIlvaine &amp; Co|location=London|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted  a refutation later that year by [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|Samuel Gardiner]], who argued that Gerard had gone too far in trying to "wipe away the reproach" which the plot had exacted on generations of English Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gardiner|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Rawson Gardiner|title=What Gunpowder Plot was |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardiner portrayed Salisbury as guilty of nothing more than opportunism. Subsequent attempts to prove Salisbury's involvement, such as Francis Edwards's 1969 work ''Guy Fawkes: the real story of the gunpowder plot?'', have similarly foundered on the lack of any clear evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=Francis|title=Guy Fawkes: the real story of the gunpowder plot?|publisher=Hart-Davis|location=London|year=1969|isbn=0246639679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cellars under the Houses of Parliament continued to be leased out to private individuals until 1678, when news of the Popish Plot broke. It was then considered prudent to search the cellars on the day before each [[State Opening of Parliament]], a ritual that survives to this day.&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonp118"/&gt;

===Bonfire Night===
{{Main|Guy Fawkes Night}}
[[File:6 november bonfire from flickr user sjnikon.jpg|thumb|alt=A night-time photograph of a blazing fire is silhouetted by dark figures.|Bonfires are lit in Britain every 5th of November to commemorate the failure of the plot.]]
In January 1606, during the first sitting of Parliament since the plot, the [[Observance of 5th November Act 1605]] was passed, making services and sermons commemorating the event an annual feature of English life;&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.show.me.uk/gunpowderplot/adults_plot_ac.htm |title=Aftermath: Commemoration |date=2005–2006 |publisher=gunpowderplot.parliament.uk |accessdate=31 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tsz6Mlcb?url=http://www.show.me.uk/gunpowderplot/adults_plot_ac.htm |archivedate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the act remained in force [[Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859|until 1859]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{citation|author=House of Commons Information Office |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g08.pdf |title=The Gunpowder Plot |publisher=parliament.uk |date=September 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215195506/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g08.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition of marking the day with the ringing of church bells and bonfires started soon after the Plot's discovery, and fireworks were included in some of the earliest celebrations.&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt; In Britain, the 5th of November is variously called Bonfire Night, Fireworks Night, or [[Guy Fawkes Night]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;

It remains the custom in Britain, on or around 5&amp;nbsp;November, to let off [[fireworks]]. Traditionally, in the weeks running up to the 5th, children made "guys"—effigies supposedly of Fawkes—usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper, and fitted with a grotesque mask, to be burnt on the 5&amp;nbsp;November bonfire. These guys were exhibited in the street to collect money for fireworks, although this custom has become less common.&lt;ref name="icons"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/bonfire-night/features/a-penny-for-the-guy-in-progress |title=Bonfire Night: A penny for the Guy |publisher=icons.org.uk |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113083659/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/bonfire-night/features/a-penny-for-the-guy-in-progress |archivedate=13 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word guy thus came in the 19th century to mean an oddly dressed person, and hence in the 20th and 21st centuries to mean any male person.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;

November the 5th firework displays and bonfire parties are common throughout Britain, in major public displays and in private gardens.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; In some areas, particularly in Sussex, there are extensive processions, large bonfires and firework displays organised by local [[Sussex Bonfire Societies|bonfire societies]], the most elaborate of which take place in [[Lewes]].

According to the biographer [[Esther Forbes]], the Guy Fawkes Day celebration in the pre-revolutionary American colonies was a very popular holiday. In [[Boston]], the revelry on "[[Pope Night]]" took on anti-authoritarian overtones, and often became so dangerous that many would not venture out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1999|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructing the explosion===
[[File:Itv gunpowder plot mike slee.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Viewed from a distance, with a telephoto lens, a large explosion is captured in its early stages. In the foreground, assorted building materials are visible. In the background, a hillside is partially covered by a forest.|A photograph of the explosion, moments after detonation]]
In the 2005 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''[[The Gunpowder Plot: Exploding The Legend]]'', a full-size replica of the House of Lords was built and destroyed with barrels of gunpowder.  The experiment was conducted on the Advantica Spadeadam test site, and demonstrated that the explosion, if the gunpowder was in good order, would have killed all those in the building.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | title = Gunpowder plotters get their wish, 400 years on | last = Sherwin | first = Adam | publisher = timesonline.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000218/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power of the explosion was such that the {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} deep concrete walls (replicating how archives suggest the walls of the old House of Lords were constructed) were reduced to rubble. Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were themselves destroyed by the explosion; the skull of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found a considerable distance from the site. According to the findings of the programme, no one within {{convert|330|ft}} of the blast could have survived, and all of the stained glass windows in [[Westminster Abbey]] would have been shattered, as would all of the windows in the vicinity of the Palace. The explosion would have been seen from miles away, and heard from further away still. Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

The programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | title = Guy Fawkes had twice the gunpowder needed | first = Fiona | last = Govan | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523012931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | archive-date = 23 May 2012 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the gunpowder guarded by Fawkes may have survived. In March 2002 workers cataloguing archives of diarist [[John Evelyn]] at the [[British Library]] found a box containing a number of gunpowder samples, including a compressed bar with a note in Evelyn's handwriting stating that it had belonged to Guy Fawkes. A further note, written in the 19th century, confirmed this provenance, although in 1952 the document acquired a new comment: "but there was none left!"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1886016.stm |title=Guy Fawkes' gunpowder 'found' |date=21 March 2002 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=3 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405194212/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1886016.stm |archive-date=5 April 2004 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4975">The '''Hopedale Community''' was founded in [[Milford, Massachusetts]], in 1842 by [[Adin Ballou]]. He and his followers purchased {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of land on which they built homes for the community members, chapels and the factories for which the company was initially formed.  The area was later split from Milford and became the town of [[Hopedale, Massachusetts]].

Ballou believed that he could create a utopian community blending the features of a factory town with those of a religion-based commune. He called this "[[Practical Christianity]]" but unlike several similar communities, it was important to Ballou that Hopedale would not be isolated from the rest of society. The community stood for [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[abolitionism]], [[women's rights]], [[spiritualism]] and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_54oZLPtj7UC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=spann+hopedale+women&amp;sig=QVxLWfG-EX1Xofplolw1UMfXoTU#PPP1,M1|title=Hopedale: From Commune to Company Town, 1840-1920|first=Edward K.|last=Spann|date=31 March 1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780814205754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
14 years after the land was purchased, Hopedale went bankrupt. The intentional community was converted into a textile factory town. The factories were purchased by George and Ebenezer Draper, later of the [[Draper Corporation]].

== Joint Stock Community ==
Each person, upon joining the community, invested his property into the Community. Each year they were credited according to this amount. If a person were to leave the Community he was given either his initial investment or ninety percent of that which was credited to him. 

== Gender equality ==
The Hopedale Community, or Fraternal Community No. 1, made many attempts to create equality among all members. Though Ballou stated that men and women were equal members of the society he commented that male and female roles were set by their creator.  This meant that within the community men and women were allowed to take part in democratic processes but women were, for the most part, given domestically oriented jobs and the men were the governmental leaders. There was even a special sector of the "Hopedale Industrial Army" that doubled as a traditional sewing circle for women to socialize while working.  But there were several women who took on roles in the government and promotion of the community.  According to Edward K. Spann's book Hopedale: ''From Commune to Company Town, 1840–1920'', Abby H. Price, an elected official of the Hopedale community, acted as a spokeswoman for equal rights and work compensation.

== Community beliefs ==
Hopedale Community was founded upon Ballou's [[Universalism|Universalist]] beliefs about [[Christianity]].  He believed that Jesus Christ had made it possible for people to live a good life on Earth and so this community was instituted to be an example of this life.  The [[Christian]] lifestyle at Hopedale was more concerned with equality, love and sharing than it was about the dogmas of religion.  In his book, Practical Christian Socialism, Ballou outlines the principles of theology, righteousness and social order.

I. Principles of Theological Truth&lt;br /&gt;
1. The existence of one All-Perfect Infinite God.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The mediatorial manifestation of God through Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Divine revelations and inspirations given to men.&lt;br /&gt;
4. The immortal existence of human and angelic spirits.&lt;br /&gt;
5. The moral agency and religious obligation of mankind.&lt;br /&gt;
6. The certainty of a perfect divine retribution.&lt;br /&gt;
7. The necessity of man's spiritual regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;
8. The final universal triumph of good over evil.

II. Principles of Personal Righteousness.&lt;br /&gt;
1. Reverence for the Divine and spiritual.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Self-denial for righteousness' sake.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Justice to all beings.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Truth in all manifestations of mind.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Love in all spiritual relations.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Purity in all things.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Patience in all right aims and pursuits.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Unceasing progress towards perfection.

III. Principles of Social Order&lt;br /&gt;
1. The supreme Fatherhood of God.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The universal Brotherhood of Man.&lt;br /&gt;
3. The declared perfect love of God to Man.&lt;br /&gt;
4. The required perfect love of Man to God.&lt;br /&gt;
5. The required perfect love of Man to Man.&lt;br /&gt;
6. The required just reproof and disfellowship of evildoers.&lt;br /&gt;
7. The required non-resistance of evildoers with evil.&lt;br /&gt;
8. The designed unity of the righteous.

'''Industry Will Save Georgia''' (''Mretsveloba Gadaarchens Sak'art'velos'', მრეწველობა გადაარჩენს საქართველოს) is a [[centre-right]] [[conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Nodia123"/&gt;

It was founded in 1999 by [[Gogi Topadze]], the proprietor of a big beer and drinks company (Kazbegi) and gathered pro-business and industrial lobbyists. Its main objective was to change the country's economic policy, especially by fighting the influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nina |last=Dadalari |title=Transnationalization and the Georgian State: Myth or Reality? |work=The Transnationalization of Economies, States, and Civil Societies: New Challenges for Governance in Europe |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Nodia |last2=Pinto Scholtbach |title=The Political Landscape of Georgia |year=2006 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Gogi Topadze |newspaper=Civil Georgia |date=1 May 2010 |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party took part in the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 1999|1999 parliamentary elections]] and won 15 seats, making it the third-strongest party. Even though it was not part of the government, it co-operated with then-ruling [[Union of Citizens of Georgia|Citizens' Union of Georgia]] (CUG) of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and did not constitute a firm opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Lincoln A. |last=Mitchell |title=Uncertain Democracy: U.S. Foreign Policy and Georgia's Rose Revolution |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2009 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[elections in Georgia|legislative elections]] on 28 March 2004, the party was part of the [[Rightist Opposition]] alliance, together with the [[New Rights]] party. The coalition won 23 seats, making it the second force in parliament, behind new president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]'s dominating [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]]. In the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], the party participated as part of the winning [[Georgian Dream]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=de Waal |title=A Crucial Election in Georgia |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=11 September 2012 |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/09/11/crucial-election-in-georgia/drlp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party left the Georgian Dream coalition before the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary elections]]. Despite this the Georgian Dream coalition continues to cooperate with the party. During the 2016 elections, Industry Will Save Georgia won their only majoritarian constituency without facing a competing candidate from the Georgian Dream. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Simon Nozadze, candidate of "Topadze - Industrialists" won by 61.55% in Khashuri, received 38,45% Valeri Gelashvili from "Georgian Dream" |website=Interpressnews |date=31 October 2016|url=http://www.interpressnews.ge/ge/skhva/404456-khashurshi-6155--ith-thofadze-mretsvelebis-kandidatma-simon-nozadzem-gaimarjva-3845-miigho-qarthuli-ocnebidan-valeri-gelashvilma.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Internal Security Organisation''' ('''ISO''') is the [[Uganda]] [[Government of Uganda|government]]'s counter intelligence agency responsible for providing national security intelligence to Uganda's policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1329970/iso-helping-police-track-killers-muslim-sheikhs|title=ISO helping Police track down killers of Muslim sheikhs|accessdate=17 August 2016 |date=8 July 2015 | newspaper=[[New Vision]] |location=Kampala |first=John |last=Semakula}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also engages in covert activities at the request of the [[President of Uganda]]. Founded in 1986, the organisation took over the duties first performed by Military Intelligence. Its headquarters are in [[Nakasero]], [[Kampala]]. 

==History and function==
ISO was established by an Act of Parliament, the Security Organisations Act 1987. Like all intelligence organisations, its main function is to ensure the stability and longevity of the state. It does this through monitoring priority government programmes that are critical to the well being of the state, as well as collecting intelligence on locally based groups engaging in or intending to engage in acts of subversion, sabotage or destabilising the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/305 | title=Security Organisations Act 1987 | date=13 November 1987 |

==Director general==
The first director general was [[Major General]] [[Jim Muhwezi|Jim Katugugu Muhwezi]]. He led ISO from 1986 until 1996. He is the longest serving spy chief at the organization to date. He recruited and trained Dr Amos Mukumbi and Brigadier [[Ronnie Balya]], each of whom was later to serve as director general.&lt;ref name="Out"/&gt; Other director generals include Philip Idro, [[Henry Tumukunde|Lieutenant General Henry Tumukunde]], [[Brigadier]] [[Elly Kayanja]], and Dr Amos Mukumbi. It is currently led by Colonel Frank Kaka Bagyenda.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |first=Alex B. |title=ISO boss forced out of office | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/974722/-/x39jnu/-/www.qatarairways.com/ug| location=Kampala | accessdate=17 August 2016 |
date=11 August 2010 |last=Atuhaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
ISO is composed of professional intelligence officers recruited from all over Uganda and trained at its training institute, the Institute of Intelligence and Security Studies. Upon being passed out, the operatives are sworn to protect the Ugandans and their property and are deployed all over the country.&lt;ref name="Out"/&gt;

[[Image:Intl Peace Gardens SLC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Japanese Garden-International Peace Gardens]]
The '''International Peace Gardens''' is a [[botanical garden]] located in Jordan Park in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].

Part of Utah's history, the garden was conceived in 1939 and dedicated in 1952. The International Peace Gardens has welcomed tens of thousands of travelers from every corner of the globe, including exchange partners from Salt Lake's several [[Twin_towns_and_sister_cities|Sister Cities]]. The project was brought to fruition by Utah citizen Mrs. Otto (Ruey) Wiesley, working with the Salt Lake City Superintendent of Parks, the Mayor, and the Salt Lake Council of Women. Today, the garden remains under the direction of the Salt Lake Council of Women Past Presidents Council. Each participating Utah-based nation group is allotted a plot in which to create a garden with native plantings and garden architecture and statues of world peace leaders typical of the homeland and its culture. The Peace Gardens currently represents the cultural diversity of 28 gardens and encourages pleasant wandering and meditation by visitors.

==Background==
The purpose of the Salt Lake Council of Women is to take an active interest in community affairs and to promote whatever may contribute to the general welfare of the communities on the Wasatch Front.

The gardens comprise 11 acres and are located in Jordan Park along the banks of the [[Jordan_River_(Utah)|Jordan River]] at 9th West and 10th South in Salt Lake. They symbolize the true spirit of democracy and world peace, brotherly love, history, literature, and cultural heritage of many lands.

The project was initiated in 1939 by Mrs. Otto Wiesley, Citizenship Chair, for good citizenship and to give foreign origin groups a specific part in the beautification of the City for the coming Centennial Celebration of 1947. It was presented to the City Commission and the Parks department and was given their approval and support.

The garden project was stopped before anything was planted because of the onset of [[World War II]], but was resumed in 1947.

Each of the nationality groups is allotted a garden section which they design, create and plant at their own expense. Plans have to be approved by the City Parks Director before they are implemented. As each garden is completed, it is dedicated and presented to the City, who then assumes the permanent maintenance of the garden.

The United States became the first country represented in the gardens. Its section is the largest of the sections representing countries from the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The second section to be organized, planted, and dedicated was the [[Japan|Japanese]] garden. Others followed every year until there were 28 countries represented with others who would like to have a garden, but unfortunately space ran out. Land has opened up on the northwest side of the gardens across the river and has been deeded to the City by Union Pacific; some hope that the gardens will obtain use of it for purposes of expansion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10543">The '''Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee''' ('''JAC''', {{lang-ru|'''Еврейский антифашистский комитет'''}} ''Yevreysky antifashistsky komitet'', '''ЕАК''') was organized by the Jewish [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] (labor union) leaders [[Henryk Erlich]] and [[Victor Alter]], upon an initiative of Soviet authorities, in fall 1941; both were released from prison in connection with their participation.&lt;ref&gt;Blatman, Daniel (8 July 2010) "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Alter_Wiktor Alter, Wiktor]." Translated from the Hebrew by David Fachler. ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 21 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blatman, Daniel (6 August 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Erlich_Henryk Ehrlich, Henryk]." Translated from the Hebrew by David Fachler. ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 21 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Following their re-arrest, in December 1941, the Committee was reformed on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s order&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag-Montefiore|Sebag-Montefiore, Simon]]. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar. 2003. page 560.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Samara, Russia|Kuibyshev]] in April 1942 with the official support of the Soviet authorities. It was designed to influence international public opinion and organize political and material support for the Soviet fight against [[Nazi Germany]], particularly from the [[Western world|West]]. In 1952, as part of the persecution of Jews in the last year part of Stalin's rule (for example, the "[[Doctors' plot]]"), most prominent members of the JAC were arrested on trumped-up spying charges, tortured, tried in secret proceedings, and executed in the basement of [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka Prison]]. Stalin and elements of the KGB were worried about their influence and connections with the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=''The Forward''|author1=Talya Zax|title=65 Years Ago, The USSR Murdered Its Greatest Jewish Poets. What’s Left Of Their Legacy?|url=http://forward.com/culture/379568/65-years-ago-the-ussr-murdered-its-greatest-jewish-poets-whats-left-of-thei|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=August 12, 2017|quote=...they...were executed in the [Lubyanka Prison]'s basement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were officially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1988.

==Activities==
[[Solomon Mikhoels]], the popular actor and director of the [[Moscow State Jewish Theatre]], was appointed the JAC chairman. The JAC's newspaper in [[Yiddish]] was called ''Eynigkayt'' ({{lang|yi|אייניקייט}} "Unity", [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: ''Эйникейт'').

The JAC broadcast pro-Soviet [[propaganda]] to foreign audiences, assuring them of the absence of [[antisemitism]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1943, Mikhoels and [[Itzik Feffer]], the first official representatives of the Soviet Jewry allowed to visit the [[Western world|West]], embarked on a seven-month tour to the United States, Mexico, Canada and the [[United Kingdom]] to increase their support for the [[Lend-Lease]]. In the US, they were welcomed by a National Reception Committee chaired by [[Albert Einstein]] and by B.Z. Goldberg, [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s son-in-law, and [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]. The largest pro-Soviet rally ever in the United States was held on July 8 at the [[Polo Grounds]], where 50,000 people listened to Mikhoels, Feffer, [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]], [[Sholem Asch]], and Chairman of [[World Jewish Congress]] [[Rabbi]] [[Stephen Samuel Wise]]. Among others, they met [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]].

In addition to the funds for the Soviet war effort – US$16 million raised in the US, $15 million in England, $1 million in Mexico, $750,000 in [[Mandatory Palestine]] – other help was also contributed: machinery, medical equipment, medicine, ambulances, clothes. On July 16, 1943, ''[[Pravda]]'' reported: "Mikhoels and Feffer received a message from Chicago that a special conference of the Joint initiated a campaign to finance a thousand ambulances for the needs of the [[Red Army]]." The visit also evoked the American public to the necessity of entering the European war.

==Persecution==
[[Image:Soviet Jews participation in WW2.png|right|thumb|1946. The official response to an inquiry by JAC about the participation of the Jewish soldiers in the war (1.8% of the total number according to Soviet army records. Many Jews declared themselves as other nationalities to avoid discrimination). Some accuse Jews of the lack of patriotism and of hiding from the military service.]]
Towards the end and immediately after the war, the JAC became involved in documenting [[the Holocaust]]. This ran contrary to the official Soviet policy to present it as atrocities against all Soviet citizens, not acknowledging the specific [[genocide]] of the Jews.

Some of the committee members were vocal supporters of the State of Israel, established in 1948, something that Stalin supported initially. Their [[Jewish diaspora|international contacts]] especially to the USA at the outset of the [[Cold War]], would eventually make them vulnerable to charges that they had become [[political correctness|politically incorrect]].

The contacts with American Jewish organizations resulted in the plan to publish ''[[The Black Book of Soviet Jewry]]'' simultaneously in the US and the Soviet Union, documenting the Holocaust and participation of Jews in the [[resistance movement]]. The Black Book was indeed published in [[New York City]] in 1946, but no Russian edition appeared. The [[movable type|typeface]] [[galley proof|galleys]] were broken up in 1948, when the political situation of Soviet Jewry  deteriorated.

In January 1948, Mikhoels was killed in [[Minsk]] by [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry of State Security]] agents who staged the murder as a car accident.&lt;ref name="reflections"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000) {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were arrested. They were charged with disloyalty, [[bourgeois nationalism]], cosmopolitanism, and planning to set up a Jewish republic in [[Crimea]] to serve US interests.

In January 1949, the Soviet mass media launched massive propaganda campaign against "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s", unmistakably aimed at Jews. Markish observed at the time: "Hitler wanted to destroy us physically, Stalin wants to do it spiritually." On 12 August 1952, at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed in the event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]" ("Ночь казненных поэтов").

==List of notable JAC members==

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') persons in  '''Togo''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in [[Togo]].

==Law regarding same-sex sexual activity==
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal, with a penalty of one to three years imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 to 500,000 [[CFA franc]]s.&lt;ref name="DOS"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/186462.pdf ''2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Togo'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, page 20]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILGA 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |title=State-sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults |last=Itaborahy |first=Lucas Paoli |date=May 2013 |publisher=The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association |accessdate=3 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The official text of Article 88 in French ([http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,TGO,456d621e2,48ef498c2,0.html Code pénal]):&lt;blockquote&gt; Sera puni d'un emprisonnement d'un à trois (03) ans et d'une amende de 100 000 à 500 000 francs quiconque aura commis un acte impudique ou contre nature avec un individu de son sexe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adoption of children==

According to a website of the French government, single and married people are eligible to adopt children. The website does not say whether LGBT people are disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/enjeux-internationaux/adoption-internationale-2605/comment-adopter-a-l-etranger/les-fiches-pays/fiches-pays-adoption/article/togo "Fiches pays Adoption: Togo", France Diplomatie, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Google translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living conditions==

No law protects persons from discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="DOS"/&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2011 human rights report found that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The law provides that a person who engages in a consensual same-sex sexual act may be punished by one to three years' imprisonment and fined 100,000 to 500,000 CFA francs ($208 to $1,041). There were no prosecutions [in 2011] for homosexuality or the often related charge of indecent assault. The eight persons arrested for same-sex sexual conduct in 2010 remained incarcerated. Societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity occurred, and there were no known lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations.&lt;ref name="DOS"/&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in  the '''British Virgin Islands''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in the [[British Virgin Islands]] since 2001.

==Law regarding same-sex sexual activity==
Before 2001, [[anal sex]] and [[oral sex]] for both heterosexuals and male homosexuals were criminal offences, referred to as "[[buggery]]" under the [[British Virgin Islands Criminal Code]]. Lesbian activity has never been illegal.

Sexual acts between two consenting adults in private were expressly decriminalized by an [[Order in Council]] in the British Virgin Islands (and other British Overseas Territories) by the British Government pursuant to Sections 3(1) and 3(7) of the ''Caribbean Territories (Criminal Law) Order, 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/united_kingdom/uknews35.htm |title=Britain Scraps Homosexuality Laws |publisher=Glapn.org |date= |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to section 4 of the order, the law has retrospective effect. There are two exceptions to the law: group sex and sex in public remain criminal offences and may also lead to charges under [[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]] and other minor sexual offence laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islandsun.com/archives/2000-December/211200/local3-v4i35.html |title=Local News – British Virgin Islands |publisher=Island Sun |date= |accessdate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713064306/http://www.islandsun.com/archives/2000-December/211200/local3-v4i35.html |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a British Overseas Territory, the British Virgin Islands Government is required to comply with their obligations under international human rights instruments. Specifically, this includes an adherence to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which highlight a responsibility to ensure non-discrimination and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/north-central-america/british-virgin-islands/?profile=all |title=Country Profile: British Virgin Islands (British Overseas Territory) |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Convention on Human Rights has been recognised by the courts as having legal effect in the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Wang Zhongyong v Union Zone Management'' (unreported) (BVIHC (Com) 0126/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in the British Overseas Territories}}

[[Same-sex marriage]] is not legal under British Virgin Islands law. The British Virgin Islands is an extremely religious society,&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the Virgin Islands defines the territory as one which "believes in God" (article 2(1)). See also: [[Christianity by country]].&lt;/ref&gt; and no discussion relating to legalisation has yet occurred in the House of Assembly.

In 2015, Premier [[Orlando Smith]], whilst affirming his personal opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], indicated that he is open to public consultation on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/bvi-public-to-decide-on-gay-marriage-if-necessary/|title=BVI public to decide on gay marriage if necessary |publisher=BVI News|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Marriage (Amendment) Act 2017'' made no provision for same-sex marriages, and politicians speaking in the House of Assembly took time to comment on the absence of such provisions and express hostility to same-sex marriage and LGBT people more broadly.&lt;ref name=Archie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bvinews.com/new/we-dont-support-gay-marriage-here-visitors-told/ |title=We don’t support gay marriage here, visitors told |publisher=BVI News |date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church leaders have indicated hostility towards the possibility of legalisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?module=news&amp;page=Article&amp;articleID=1336737366|title=Church Leaders Hopeful BVI Will Stand Ground Against Same Sex Marriages|publisher=BVI Platinum news|date=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political leaders have taken an unsympathetic approach in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&amp;articleID=1360240744|title=None Of Us Will Probably Vote For Same Sex Marriage - Health Minister|publisher=BVI Platinum News|date=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Her Majesty's Government]] has confirmed that it will not impose recognition of same-sex marriages in the British Virgin Islands by way of an [[Order in Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&amp;articleID=1390223634|title=UK Will Not Force BVI To Accept Same Sex Marriage - Governor|publisher=Platinum News|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Same-sex marriage in the United States Virgin Islands|Same-sex marriage]] is legal in the neighbouring [[United States Virgin Islands]], however.

==Discrimination protections==
[[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|The 2007 Constitution]] prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/contents/made The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007], articles 9 and 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Whereas every person in the Virgin Islands is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual;''
:''Whereas those fundamental rights and freedoms are enjoyed without distinction of any kind, such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, association with a national minority, property, family relations, economic status, disability, age, birth, sexual orientation, marital or other status, subject only to prescribed limitations;''

:''"Discriminatory" means affording different treatment to different persons on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, association with a national minority, property, family relations, economic status, disability, age, birth, sexual orientation, marital or other status''

==Living conditions==
The British Virgin Islands is a conservative and religious society. Open displays of affection between same-sex partners may offend, and LGBT people generally keep their sexual orientation a secret and stay in the closet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-british-virgin-islands/ Gay Life in British Virgin Islands]&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports of same-sex couples and LGBT people being harassed and even physically attacked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-british-virgin-islands/ ‘Openly gay couple’ allege being treated ‘like garbage’ by UK expat in VI]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these violent attacks have been justified by locals as simply "following the Bible".

The '''Leipzig War Crimes Trials''' were a series of trials held in 1921 to try alleged German [[War crime|war criminals]] of the [[First World War]] before the German ''[[Reichsgericht]]'' (Supreme Court) in [[Leipzig]], as part of the penalties imposed on the German government under the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Only twelve individuals were brought to trial (with mixed results), and the proceedings were widely regarded at the time as a failure. In the longer term, however, the trials have been seen as a significant step towards the introduction of a comprehensive system for the prosecution of violations of international law.

==Background==
During the First World War the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] leaders came up with a new concept, that once victory was achieved, defeated enemy leaders should face criminal charges for [[international law]] violations made during the war. On 25 January 1919, during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Allied governments established the [[Commission of Responsibilities]] to make recommendations to that effect. As a result, articles 227–230 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulated the arrest and trial of German officials defined as [[war criminals]] by the Allied governments. Article 227 made provision for the establishment of a special tribunal, presided over by a judge from each one of the major Allied powers – Britain, France, Italy, United States and Japan. It identified the former Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] as a war criminal, and demanded that an [[extradition]] request be addressed to the [[Dutch government]], which had given him asylum in the [[Netherlands]] since his abdication in November 1918. Article 228 allowed the Allied governments to try German war criminals in their military tribunals, nothwithstanding any proceedings taken against the same persons in German courts. The [[Weimar Republic|German government]] was required to comply with any extradition order issued by the Allied powers to that effect.

Following the conclusion of the treaty, the Allied government began their legal and diplomatic efforts to arrest the former Kaiser. On 28 June 1919, the day the treaty was signed, the President of the Paris Peace Conference addressed a [[diplomatic note]] to the Dutch government requesting the extradition of the ex-Kaiser. On 7 July the Dutch replied that any extradition of the Kaiser would be a violation of Dutch [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919: Paris Peace Conference'', vol. 13, pp. 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the issue of bringing the ex-Kaiser to trial was dropped, and he remained in the Netherlands until his death on 4 June 1941.

On 3 February 1920, the Allies submitted a further list of 900 names of individuals accused of committing alleged war crimes to the German government. However, the Germans refused to extradite any German citizens to Allied governments, and suggested instead trying them within the German justice system, i.e. at the ''Reichsgericht'' in Leipzig. This proposal was accepted by the Allied leaders, and in May 1920 they handed the German government a reduced list of 45 accused persons. Not all these people could be traced, and in other cases there was difficulty in finding credible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Leipzig Trials'', 1921, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yarnall 2011, pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end only twelve individuals were brought to trial.

==The trials==
The trials were held before the ''Reichsgericht'' (comprising seven judges) in Leipzig from 23 May to 16 July 1921.

The cases tried were:
* Sergeant [[Karl Heynen]], charged with mistreating British POWs. He was sentenced to a brief prison term of ten months.
* Captain [[Emil Müller (German officer)|Emil Müller]], charged with mistreating POWs. He was sentenced to six months in prison.
* Private Robert Neumann, charged with mistreating prisoners of war. He was sentenced to six months in prison.
* Commander Karl Neumann of [[U-boat]] {{SMU|UC-67||2}} who sank the hospital ship ''[[HMHS Dover Castle|Dover Castle]]'' in compliance with superior orders. He was found not guilty due to the fact that he was following orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&amp;context=auilr |first=Gary D. |last=Solis |title=Obedience of Orders and the Law of War: Judicial Application in American Forums |journal=American University International Law Review |volume=15 |year=1999 |pages=481–526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First-Lieutenants [[Ludwig Dithmar]] and [[John Boldt]], charged with war crimes on the high seas. They were two officers of the submarine [[SM U-86|SM ''U-86'']] that had sunk the Canadian hospital ship [[HMHS Llandovery Castle|''Llandovery Castle'']] and then machine-gunned survivors in the lifeboats. They were each sentenced to four years in prison. Their commanding officer, [[Helmut Brümmer-Patzig]], had fled to the [[Free City of Danzig]] and was never prosecuted.
* [[Max Ramdohr]], charged with crimes against the civilian noncombatants in occupied Belgium. He was found not guilty.
* Lieutenant-General [[Karl Stenger]] and Major [[Benno Crusius]], charged with mistreating French POWs. Stenger was found not guilty, while Crusius was sentenced to two years in prison.
* First-Lieutenant [[Adolph Laule]], charged with crimes against the civilian population of occupied France. He was found not guilty.
* Lieutenant-General [[Hans von Schack (general)|Hans von Schack]] and Major-General [[Benno Kruska]], charged with mistreating POWs. Both were found not guilty.

==Response==
Outside Germany, the trials were seen as something of a travesty because of the small number of cases tried and the perceived leniency of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Yarnall 2011, pp. 194–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside Germany, on the other hand, they were seen as excessively harsh for several reasons:
* Of all the belligerents, only German servicemen were being tried. (See [[Victor's justice]].)
* The accused seemed in several cases to have been merely trying to perform their duty under difficult conditions.
* Several of the charges seemed spurious.
* Imprisonment in a civil jail was regarded as insulting to military honor.

Following the Heynen case, the ''German Gazette'' commented:

:"The first verdict in the series of Leipzig trials has agitated public opinion in two great countries, Germany and England, in apparently sharply contrasting ways. The degree of punishment has been criticised in England in a way that is in the highest degree wounding to German susceptibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yarnall 2011, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 1922, a commission of Allied [[jurist]]s, appointed to inquire into the trials, concluded that it was useless to proceed with them any further and recommended that the remaining accused should be handed over to the Allies for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Yarnall 2011, pp. 195–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not done, and the trials were quietly abandoned.

==Legacy==
Although largely regarded as a failure at the time, the Leipzig trials were the first attempt to devise a comprehensive system for prosecution of violations of international law. This trend was renewed during the [[Second World War]], as Allied governments decided to try, after the war, defeated Axis leaders for war crimes committed during the war, notably the [[Nuremberg Trial]]s and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]].

Following the end of the [[Cold War]], the same trend led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002.

[[File:2014_militrary_expenditures_absolute.svg|upright=1.6|thumb|Countries by military expenditures (absolute) in 2014, based on data from the [[World Bank]]]]

This article is a '''list of countries by military expenditure''' in a given year. [[Military budget|Military expenditure]] figures are presented in [[United States dollar]]s based on either constant or current exchange rates.&lt;ref name=SIPRI-2017 /&gt; These results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the [[exchange rate]]s of each country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next.

The first list is based on the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) 2018 fact sheet, which includes a list on the world's top 15 military spenders in 2017, based on current market exchange rates.&lt;ref name=SIPRI-2017 /&gt; The second list is based on the 2016 edition of "The Military Balance" published by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS) using average market exchange rates.&lt;ref name="IISS"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Military Balance 2015|author1 = International Institute for Strategic Studies|authorlink1 = International Institute for Strategic Studies|author2 = |date = 11 February 2015|publisher = [[Routledge]]|location = [[London]]|isbn = 1857437667|ref = IISS2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luc Nkulula''' (October 18, 1985 - June 10, 2018) was a Congolese political activist.

'''Mabilafu''' is located about 110&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Freetown]] and about 30&amp;nbsp;km south-west of [[Makeni]]. It is on the bank of the [[Rokel River]], the largest river in Sierra Leone. Mabilafu is the main village of the same-named [[Mabilafu Section]], which contains six villages. The Mabilafu Section is one of the sections in the [[Malal Mara Chiefdom]] in the [[Tonkolili District]] in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone Province]].

In 2013 the village encompassed roughly 140 houses with a total population of approximately thousand people. The large majority of them were [[Temne people|Temne]] – the prevalent [[Ethnic groups in Sierra Leone|ethnic group]] in this area – and [[Islam in Sierra Leone|Muslims]] – the predominant [[religion in Sierra Leone]]. However, [[animism|animist believes]] and [[secret society|secret societies]] such as the [[Poro|Poro-Society]] play important roles in the everyday experiences of the people.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"&gt;Käser, Fabian 2014: Ethnography of a Land-deal. A Village Perspective on the Addax Bioenergy Project. Berne, University of Berne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most houses of the village are along a dead-ending dirt road that approaches the Rokel River approximately at the right angles. Closer to the river the road splits and the lower part of the village is wider (see satellite image of Mabilafu). This lower part of the village is older than the upper part, where most houses just had been constructed recently. The village is divided roughly in four quarters, each for one of the four [[#landowning families of Mabilafu]]. The [[mosque]] can be found in the lower part of the village, where the people also have constructed a new village center, an open sided, zinc roofed cement building with a seed storage, a small stage and wooden benches. Meetings and other events take place in this village center. An [[Evangelical Mission Primary School]] is located by the end of the upper part of the village. In 2013 a total of 265 children from Mabilafu and surrounding villages were enrolled at this school that also distributed a daily meal provided by the [[World Food Program]]. &lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wfp.org/countries/sierra-leone/operations|title=Sierra Leone - World Food Programme|website=www.wfp.org|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Mabilafu.JPG|thumb|Mabilafu]]

== Economic Activities ==

{{Anchor|Economy Mabilafu}} [[Subsistence economy|Subsistence]] oriented [[shifting cultivation]] has been the predominant livelihood strategy in Mabilafu until recently. As generally in rural Sierra Leone, access to land and associated resources is organized by [[custom (law)|customary law]], rules and regulations that are developed locally and embedded in the local culture.&lt;ref name="Renner-Thomas2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ade Renner-Thomas|title=Land Tenure in Sierra Leone: The Law, Dualism and the Making of a Land Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiIpW6vWVPoC&amp;pg=PR3|year=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4490-5866-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|landowning families of Mabilafu}} Accordingly, four families own the land in Mabilafu. However, these families are obliged to share access to their land with landusers, people who do not own land. With these interlinked property and user rights, not only the families who own land, but also landusers can benefit from the land and associated resources in Mabilafu. Therewith, land and resources are like [[common-pool resources]]. This previous use of land and resources – that already had been vulnerable to food crisis – has been strongly affected by the implementation of the [[#Impacts of the Addax Bioenergy Project in Mabilafu|Addax Bioenergy Project]] that has been implemented in this region in 2010.

The village is within reach of mobile phone signals ([[airtel Africa|airtel]]) but has neither current water nor electricity. To charge the mobile phones people go to the “Charging”, the only house with a functioning generator where electronic devices can be charged for a small amount. Further, a simple black smith has been installed behind some houses to produce tools for farming and constructing and pots for cooking. Behind another house, a garage has been set up to repair motorbikes and a carpenter produces furniture. Some women have established small temporary shops to sell petty commodities like soap, sweets, salt, cigarettes, top-up cares, drugs, vegetables or fish and two shelter serve as temporarily bars.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

== Impacts of the Addax Bioenergy Project in Mabilafu ==
The [[Addax Bioenergy Project]] is a so-called [[land grabbing|large-scale land acquisition]] project. In 2010 Addax Bioenergy acquired 54’000 hectare land in this region to produce agro-ethanol or so called [[biofuel]] from [[sugarcane]], grown on irrigated plots.&lt;ref name="afdb.org"&gt;http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Addax%20Bioenergy%20-%20RAP%20summary%20-%20Final%20EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mabilafu is inside the Addax Bioenergy Project area and close by the construction site for the project’s agro-ethanol processing factory that started its operation in 2014.&lt;ref name="afdb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.addaxbioenergy.com/en/news.php?idnews=36&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this project has led to profound changes in Mabilafu. Land has been acquired for the construction of the agro-ethanol processing factory, related infrastructure and sugarcane plantations.&lt;ref name="afdb.org"/&gt; Thereby, [[#Economy Mabilafu|access to land and important resources]] for the hitherto prevalent subsistence oriented livelihood strategy in Mabilafu has been seriously limited. Even though landowners are monetary compensated with a small annual lease and acknowledgment payment and one-off payments for destroyed local assets, such as cropped areas and so called economic trees,&lt;ref&gt;Economic trees are defined by the company as “trees, shrubs or plants that are grown for their intrinsic value” [https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2014/index.php/Sandstrom-549_paper.pdf?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=Sandstrom-549_paper.pdf&amp;form_id=549&amp;form_version=final  Implementing a Large Land Based investment in Sierra Leone]&lt;/ref&gt; this compensation is inadequate. 
# [[#The money paid by the company|The money that the landowners receive, is too small to compensate the losses they experienced.]] 
# [[#compensation of landusers|Landusers, who previously also could use this land and associated resources, generally don’t received money from the company.]] 
# [[#Other mitigation measures|Other mitigation measures implemented by the company to compensate for negative impacts are not able to compensate the above-mentioned losses.]]
{{Anchor|The money paid by the company}} The company pays an annual lease and acknowledgement of ca. 35’000 [[Sierra Leonean leone|Leones]] per [[hectare]] per year to the landowner.&lt;ref name="afdb.org"/&gt; Further, compensations are paid for economic trees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2014/index.php/Sandstrom-549_paper.pdf?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=Sandstrom-549_paper.pdf&amp;form_id=549&amp;form_version=final&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to the negative impacts on the [[#Economy Mabilafu|previous land- and resource use]] – that already had been debilitated previously – the money paid to the landowners is very small and insufficient to buy substituting food therefrom.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

{{Anchor|compensation of landusers}} Further, the [[#Economy Mabilafu|previous organization of access to land and associated resources]] enabled not only landowners, but also landusers, to benefit from the land and associated resources. However, [[#The money paid by the company|compensations paid by the company]] benefit solely landowners but not the landusers who also lost access to previously used land and associated resources. This indicates that the compensation measures do not consider the previous local property and user rights adequately.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

{{Anchor|Other mitigation measures}} Other mitigation measures such as the Farmer Development Program, a development program implemented by the company, aiming at modernizing the [[#Economy Mabilafu|local agriculture]] and enhancing local food production, or the creation of wage-employment failed to compensate the losses caused by the large-scale land acquisition. Due to organizational constraints and lacking consideration of the local context, the Farmer Development Program in Mabilafu failed. Harvests were poor and people were not able to adopt the newly thought mode of production. Thus, this program could not benefit the people. Further, the company assumed to create positive impacts by the creation of new wage-employment. However, in practice, this newly created wage-employment is highly [[precarious work|precarious]]. Not everybody who experienced a loss by the acquisition of land got a job and most jobs are not permanent with very low salaries. Thus, these newly created jobs do not offer a secure income that could substitute lost access to land and associated resources. Therewith, this acquisition of land by the company and the creation of wage-employment resembles [[primitive accumulation of capital|primitive accumulation]] and [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|capitalist exploitation]] as described in [[Marxism|Marxist theories]].&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

In order to deal with this new situation of precarious working condition people had to develop alternative strategies, such as maintaining [[#economy mabilafu|subsistence production]] or establishing [[informal sector|informal economic activities]]. However, not everybody was able to develop such alternative strategies successfully and especially people that have been underprivileged previously, experienced great difficulties or failed totally to develop strategies in order to cope with the new situation.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

Further, even though the newly created jobs are precarious, they attracted a great number of people – mostly men – searching employment. Thus, in the last years, the number of people living in Mabilafu increased greatly. If previously mostly women moved to Mabilafu – due to the customary of [[patrilocal residence|virilocal]] marriage – in the last years the number of men moving to Mabilafu increased greatly.&lt;ref name="Käser 2014"/&gt;

This reveals that the impacts of the Addax Bioenergy Project in Mabilafu are challenging for the people living in the village, even though the company praises itself to be a best practice example for sustainable large-scale land acquisition.&lt;ref name="afdb.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5733">The '''Cabinet of Moltke I''' was the government of [[Denmark]] from 22 March 1848 to 15 November 1848. It was also referred to as the ''March Cabinet''.

In March 1848, Copenhagen was full of rumours that [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] had rebelled against Denmark, and the [[National Liberal Party (Denmark)|National Liberals]] took advantage of the situation by arranging protest demonstrations against King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] and his politics.&lt;ref name=Skou10&gt;Skou. ''Dansk politik A-Å'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, King Frederick responded by dismissing his ministers and asking [[Carl Emil Bardenfleth]] to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neergaard|first=M.|title=Under junigrundloven - En fremstilling af det danske folks politiske historie fra 1848 til 1866 - første bind|year=1892|publisher=P. G. Philipsens forlag|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardenfleth failed to reach a compromise with the National Liberals, however, and so did [[Peter Georg Bang]] whom the king had asked to take his place. On the morning of 22 March the king begged [[Adam Wilhelm Moltke]], the leader of the previous cabinet, to lead a government of responsible ministers, effectively ending the [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name=Skou10 /&gt; Moltke quickly managed to put a government together, the Cabinet of Moltke I.

It was replaced by the [[Cabinet of Moltke II]] on 15 November 1848.

Some of the terms in the table end after 15 November 1848 because the minister was in the Cabinet of Moltke II as well.

The '''Native Laws Amendment Act, 1952''' (Act No. 54 of 1952, subsequently renamed the '''Bantu Laws Amendment Act, 1952''' and the '''Black Laws Amendment Act, 1952'''), formed part of the [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation in [[South Africa]]. 
It amended section 10 of the [[Group Areas Act]].&lt;ref name= "sahist"/&gt; It limited the category of blacks who had the right to permanent residence in urban areas. While Section 10 had  granted permanent residence to blacks who had been born in a town and had lived there continuously for more than 15 years, or who had been employed there continuously for at least 15 years, or who had worked continuously for the same employer for more than 10 years. Non-whites living in urban areas who did not meet these criteria faced forcible removal.&lt;ref name= "sahist"&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Norwegian Peace Council''' (Norwegian: ''Norges Fredsråd'') is the largest [[peace]] organisation in Norway. It is an umbrella organisation of 20 non-governmental organisations concerned with peace. It was founded on 25 October 1945 by seven NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Johanne Skog Gripsrud, ''Fredsarbeid og fredsarbeidere : glimt fra historien om fred og frihet'' (pp. 66–67), [[Universitetsforlaget]], 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Its honorary President is [[Fredrik S. Heffermehl]].

'''Peak water''' is a concept that underlines the growing constraints on the availability, quality, and use of [[freshwater]] resources.

Peak water is defined in a 2010 [[peer-reviewed]] article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' by [[Peter Gleick]] and Meena Palaniappan.&lt;ref name="Gleick, P.H., M. Palaniappan. 11155–11162"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguish between peak renewable, peak non-renewable, and peak ecological water in order to demonstrate the fact that although there is a vast amount of water on the planet, [[sustainably]] managed water is becoming scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Lester R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''peak water'' sparks debates similar to those about [[peak oil]]. In 2010, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' chose "peak water" as one of its 33 "Words of the Year".&lt;ref name="NY Times 'Words of the Year"&gt;{{cite web 
  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/weekinreview/19sifton.html

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are concerns about impending peak water in several areas around the world:
* Peak renewable water, where entire renewable flows are being consumed for human use
* Peak non-renewable water, where groundwater aquifers are being overpumped (or contaminated) faster than nature recharges them (this example is most like the peak oil debate)
* Peak ecological water, where ecological and environmental constraints are overwhelming the economic benefits provided by water use&lt;ref name="Gleick, P.H., M. Palaniappan. 11155–11162" /&gt;
If present trends continue, 1.8 billion people will be living with absolute [[water scarcity]] by 2025, and two-thirds of the world could be subject to [[water stress]].&lt;ref name="UNEP2007"&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf

  |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]
  |page=97
  |year=2007
  |format=PDF
  |accessdate=2009-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, peak water is not about running out of freshwater, but about reaching physical, economic, and environmental limits on meeting human demands for water and the subsequent decline of water availability and use.

The [[Hubbert curve]] has become popular in the scientific community for predicting the depletion of various natural resources. [[M.

Some forms of water, however, such as [[fossil water]], exhibit similar characteristics to oil, and overpumping (faster than the rate of natural recharge of groundwater) often results in a Hubbert-type peak. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref name=Palaniappan2008/&gt; Like peak oil, peak water is inevitable given the rate of extraction of certain water systems.

The amount of available freshwater supply in some regions is decreasing because of (i) [[climate change]], which has caused receding [[glacier]]s, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes; (ii) contamination of water by [[human waste|human]] and [[industrial waste]]s; and (iii) overuse of non-renewable groundwater [[aquifers]]. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total freshwater supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for [[Tap water|drinking]], [[industry]], and [[agriculture]].

==Water demand==
Water demand already exceeds supply in many parts of the world, and as the world population continues to rise, many more areas are expected to experience this imbalance in the near future.

Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Pimentel2004"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Agriculture]], [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] all serve to increase water consumption.

==Freshwater withdrawal by country==
The highest total annual consumption of water comes from India, China and the United States, countries with large populations, extensive agricultural irrigation, and demand for food. See the following table:

===India===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in India}}
[[Image:Le labourage à l’aide de buffles.jpg|thumb|Working [[rice paddies]]]]
India has 20 percent of the Earth's population, but only four percent of its water. [[Water table]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are dropping rapidly in some of India's main agricultural areas. The [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Ganges river]]s are tapped so heavily that, except in rare wet years, they no longer reach the sea.&lt;ref name=Beiser20071107&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/73-worldwide_water_worries.html |title=Earth: Worldwide Water Worries |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Wired Science |author=Vince Beiser |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605194701/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/73-worldwide_water_worries.html |archivedate=June 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has the largest water withdrawal out of all the countries in the world. Eighty-six percent of that water supports agriculture.&lt;ref name=PacificInstitute2008table2/&gt; That heavy use is dictated in large part by what people eat. People in India consume a lot of [[rice]]. Rice farmers in India typically get less than half the yield per unit area while using ten times more water than their Chinese counterparts. Economic development can make things worse because as people's living standards rise, they tend to eat more meat, which requires lots of water to produce. Growing a tonne of grain requires 1,000 tonnes of water; producing a tonne of beef requires 15,000 tonnes. To make a single hamburger requires around 4,940 liters (1,300 gallons) of water&lt;ref name=Beiser20071107/&gt; A glass of orange juice needs 850 liters (225 gallons) of freshwater to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Ogallala Aquifer]] in the southern high plains ([[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]) is being mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment—a classic example of peak non-renewable water. Portions of the aquifer will not naturally recharge due to layers of clay between the surface and the water-bearing formation, and because rainfall rates simply do not match rates of extraction for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The two rivers feeding the [[Aral Sea]] were dammed up and the water was diverted to irrigate the desert so that cotton could be produced. As a result, the Aral Sea's water has become much saltier and the sea's water level has decreased by over 60%. Drinking water is now contaminated with [[pesticides]] and other agricultural chemicals and contains bacteria and viruses.

According to Walid A. Abderrahman (2001), "Water Demand Management in Saudi Arabia", [[Saudi Arabia]] reached peak water in the early 1990s, at more than 30 billion cubic meters per year, and declined afterward. The peak had arrived at about midpoint, as expected for a [[Hubbert curve]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3520&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the water production is about half the peak rate. Saudi Arabian food production has been based on "[[fossil water]]"—water from ancient aquifers that is being recharged very slowly, if at all. [[Peak oil|Like oil]], fossil water is non-renewable, and it is bound to run out someday. Saudi Arabia has abandoned its self-sufficient food production and is now importing virtually all of its food.&lt;ref name=Abderrahman2001/&gt; Saudi Arabia has built [[desalination]] plants to provide about half the country’s freshwater. The remainder comes from groundwater (40%), surface water (9%) and [[reclaimed wastewater]] (1%).

[[Libya]] is working on a network of water pipelines to import water, called the [[Great Manmade River]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has approximately {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} of [[arable land]] irrigated by canals and tube wells, mostly using water from the [[Indus River]]. Dams were constructed at [[Chashma, Pakistan|Chashma]], [[Mangla]], and [[Tarbela]] to feed the irrigation system. Since the completion of the [[Tarbela Dam]] in 1976 no new capacity has been added despite astronomical growth in population. The gross capacity of the three dams has decreased because of sedimentation, a continual process. Per-capita surface-water availability for irrigation was 5,260 cubic meters per year in 1951. This has been reduced to a mere 1,100 cubic meters per year in 2006.

===Health problems===
The quality of drinking water is vital for human health. Peak water constraints result in people not having access to safe water for basic personal hygiene. "Infectious [[waterborne disease]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as [[diarrhea]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]] are responsible for 80 percent of illnesses and deaths in the developing world, many of them children. One child dies every eight seconds from a waterborne disease; 15 million children a year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Vital aquifers everywhere are becoming contaminated with toxins. Once an aquifer is contaminated, it is not likely that it can ever recover. Contaminants are more likely to cause chronic health effects. Water can be contaminated from pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Also, toxic organic chemicals can be a source of water contamination. Inorganic contaminants include [[toxic metal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s like [[arsenic]], [[barium]], [[chromium]], [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[silver]]. [[Nitrates]] are another source of inorganic contamination. Finally, [[Leachate|leaching]] radioactive elements into the water supply can contaminate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Human conflicts over water===
Some conflicts of the future may be fought over the availability, quality, and control of water. Water has also been used as a tool in conflicts or as a target during conflicts that start for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In West Africa and other places like [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] (such as the [[Ganges Delta]]), and [[Peru]], major changes in the rivers generate a significant risk of violent conflict in coming years. Water management and control could play a part in future resource wars over scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Solutions==
Freshwater usage has great potential for better conservation and management as it is used inefficiently nearly everywhere, but until actual scarcity hits, people tend to take access to freshwater for granted.

===Water conservation===
{{Further information|water conservation}}
There are several ways to reduce the use of water.&lt;ref name=popmec200811&gt;{{cite web

  |author=Michael Milstein

  |accessdate=2009-01-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most irrigation systems waste water; typically, only between 35% and 50% of water withdrawn for irrigated agriculture ever reaches the crops. Most soaks into unlined canals, leaks out of pipes, or evaporates before reaching (or after being applied to) the fields. [[Swale (geographical feature)|Swales]] and [[cistern]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to catch and store excess [[rainwater]].

Water should be used more efficiently in industry, which should use a closed [[water cycle]] if possible. Also, industry should prevent polluting water so that it can be returned into the water cycle. Whenever possible, [[Graywater|gray wastewater]] should be used to irrigate trees or lawns. Water drawn from aquifers should be recharged by treating the wastewater and returned to the aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water can be conserved by not allowing freshwater to be used to irrigate luxuries such as [[golf course]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Luxury goods should not be produced in areas where freshwater has been depleted. For example, 1,500 liters of water is used on average for the manufacturing of a single computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Water management===
{{Further information|Water management}} {{Further information |Soft water path}}
Sustainable water management involves the scientific planning, developing, distribution and optimization of water resources under defined water policies and regulations.

Experience shows that higher water prices lead to improvements in the efficiency of use—a classical argument in economics, pricing, and markets. For example, [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], Nevada, raised its water rates in 2008 to encourage conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists propose to encourage conservation by adopting a system of progressive pricing whereby the price per unit of water used would start out very small, and then rise substantially for each additional unit of water used. This tiered-rate approach has been used for many years in many places, and is becoming more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Conversely, certain subsidies can lead to inefficient use of water. Water subsidies often involve contentious policy issues that are political in nature. In 2004, the [[Environmental Working Group]] criticized the United States government for selling subsidized water to corporate farms for an average price of only $17 per acre foot (326,000 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his book [[The Ultimate Resource|''The Ultimate Resource 2'']], [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] claimed that there is a strong correlation between [[Corruption Perceptions Index|government corruption]] and lack of sufficient supplies of safe, clean water. Simon wrote, "there is complete agreement among water economists that all it takes to ensure an adequate supply for agriculture as well as for households in rich countries is that there be a rational structure of [[water law]] and market pricing. The problem is not too many people but rather defective laws and bureaucratic interventions; freeing up markets in water would eliminate just about all water problems forever... In poor water-short countries the problem with water supply—as with so many other matters—is lack of wealth to create systems to supply water efficiently enough. As these countries become richer, their water problems will become less difficult".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ The Ultimate Resource 2], chapter 10, by Julian Simon&lt;/ref&gt; This theoretical argument, however, ignores real-world conditions, including strong barriers to open water markets, the difficulty of moving water from one region to another, inability of some populations to pay for water, and grossly imperfect information on water use. Actual experience with peak water constraints in some wealthy, but water-short countries and regions still suggests serious difficulties in reducing water challenges.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Climate change===

Extensive research has shown the direct links between water resources, the [[hydrologic cycle]], and climatic change. As climate changes, there will be substantial impacts on water demands, precipitation patterns, storm frequency and intensity, snowfall and [[snowmelt]] dynamics, and more. Evidence from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] to Working Group II, has shown climate change is already having a direct effect on animals, plants and water resources and systems. A 2007 report by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] counted 75 million to 250 million people across Africa who could face water shortages by 2020.&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|editor1-last=Parry|editor1-first=M.&amp;nbsp;L.|editor2-last=Canziani|editor2-first=O.&amp;nbsp;F.|editor3-last=Palutikof|editor3-first=J.&amp;nbsp;P.|editor4-last=van der Linden|editor4-first=P.&amp;nbsp;J.|editor5-last=Hanson|editor5-first=C.&amp;nbsp;E.|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg2_report_impacts_adaptation_and_vulnerability.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop yields could increase by 20% in East and Southeast Asia, but decrease by up to 30% in Central and South Asia. Agriculture fed by rainfall could drop by 50% in some African countries by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6532323.stm | work=BBC News | title=Billions face climate change risk | date=2007-04-06 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of other impacts could affect peak water constraints.

[[Biodiversity loss|Loss of biodiversity]] can be attributed largely to the appropriation of land for [[agroforestry]] and the effects of [[climate change]]. The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather puts additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7409034.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate 'accelerating bird loss' | date=2008-05-19 | accessdate=2010-05-22 | first=Mark | last=Kinver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7921936.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate 'hitting Europe's birds' | date=2009-03-04 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backstop water sources===
The concept of a "backstop" resource is a resource that is sufficiently abundant and sustainable to replace non-renewable resources. Thus, solar and other renewable energy sources are considered "backstop" energy options for unsustainable [[fossil fuel]]s. Similarly, Gleick and Palaniappan defined "backstop water sources" to be those resources that can replace unsustainable and non-renewable use of water, albeit typically at a higher cost.&lt;ref name="Gleick, P.H., M. Palaniappan. 11155–11162"/&gt;
The classic backstop water source is [[desalination]] of seawater. If the rate of water production is not sufficient in one area, another "backstop" could be increased interbasin transfers, such as pipelines to carry freshwater from where it is abundant to an area where water is needed.&lt;ref name=popmec200811/&gt; Water can be imported into an area using water trucks.&lt;ref name=popmec200811/&gt; The most expensive and last resort measures of getting water to a community such as desalination, water transfers are called “backstop” water sources.&lt;ref name=Palaniappan2008/&gt; Fog catchers are the most extreme of backstop methods.

To produce that fresh water, it can be obtained from ocean water through [[desalination]].&lt;ref name=popmec200811/&gt; A January 17, 2008 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' stated, "World-wide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than {{convert|12|e9USgal|m3}} of water a day, according to the [[International Desalination Association]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, several factors prevent desalination from being a panacea for water shortages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2010-10-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High capital costs to build the desalination plant
* High cost of the water produced
* Energy required to desalinate the water
* Environmental issues with the disposal of the resulting brine
* High cost of transporting water
Nevertheless, some countries like [[Spain]] are increasingly relying on desalination because of the continuing decreasing costs of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At last resort, it is possible in some particular regions to harvest water from [[fog]] using nets. The water from the nets drips into a tube. The tubes from several nets lead to a holding tank. Using this method, small communities on the edge of deserts can get water for [[drink]]ing, gardening, showering and clothes washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2009-02-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that fog catchers work in theory but have not succeeded as well in practice. This is due to the high expense of the nets and pipe, high maintenance costs and low quality of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An alternative approach is that of the [[Seawater Greenhouse]], which consists in desalinating seawater through [[evaporation]] and [[condensation]] inside a greenhouse solely using [[solar energy]]. Successful pilots have been conducted growing crops in desert locations.

Once part of Pensnett Chase, this area was the scene of extensive coal mining and charcoal manufacture before being restored as woodland and gorse-covered hillside.]]
'''Pensnett Chase''' was a wooded area of land owned by the Lords of [[Dudley Castle]] in the parishes of [[Kingswinford]] and [[Dudley]] (or mainly so).  As a chase, it was originally used by them to hunt game in although it was also used as common land by local people.  At some periods it was regarded as extending into [[Gornal, West Midlands|Gornal]] and including [[Baggeridge Country Park|Baggeridge Wood]] at one end and perhaps [[Cradley Heath]] at the other. By the 17th century the ancient woodlands had largely been cleared.  

In the early modern period, the Dudley portion of the Chase came to be known as [[Dudley Wood]] and the name was largely reserved for the portion in Kingswinford.  This was in the 18th century an extensive area of [[commonland]] which was [[inclosure|inclosed]] in the late 18th century, with the mines reserved to the [[Earl of Dudley|lord of the manor]].  It extended from the area now called [[Pensnett]] through [[Brierley Hill]] to [[Quarry Bank]]. 

==History==
Pensnett Chase, a wooded area to the south and west of Dudley, came into possession of Ralph de Somery, one of the [[Dudley Castle#List of Lords of Dudley Castle|barons of Dudley castle]] in the early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Pensnett Township"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hemmingway|first1=John|title=Pensnett (Pensnett Chase) 'Township'|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=5782&amp;type=full&amp;servicetype=Attachment|website=www.dudley.gov.uk|publisher=Dudley MBC|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Township&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hemmingway|first1=John|title=Dudley Wood (Pensnett Chase) 'Township'.|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=5763&amp;type=full&amp;servicetype=Attachment|website=www.dudley.gov.uk|publisher=Dudley MBC|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land had been part of the Forest of Kinver, owned by the monarch but was exchanged by [[John, King of England|King John]] in return for land in [[Wolverhampton]]. &lt;ref name="Birm Post"/&gt; As the name '[[Chase (land)|Chase]]' suggests, the woods were used for hunting although they were also common lands, with rights for locals to graze their animals and gather wood for fuel. &lt;ref name="Birm Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Upton|first1=Chris|title=The origins of Pensnett in the Black Country|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/lifestyle/origins-pensnett-black-country-3907422|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=Birmingham Post|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Pensnett' was probably derived from the two elements 'pen' meaning a hill and 'snaed' an Old English word for a wood. &lt;ref name="Pensnett name"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guttery|first1=D.R.|title=The Story of Pensnett Chase|date=1967|publisher=County Borough of Dudley Libraries Museums and Arts Department|location=Dudley, UK.|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Chase was bordered on the south by the [[River Stour, Worcestershire|River Stour]], dividing the common land from the manor of [[Cradley, West Midlands|Cradley]]. The western boundary is not so well defined, but a 17th-century map shows the Chase extending further than [[Enville, Staffordshire|Enville]].&lt;ref name="Pensnett extent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guttery|first1=D.R.|title=The Story of Pensnett Chase|date=1967|publisher=County Borough of Dudley Libraries Museums and Arts Department|location=Dudley, UK.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the Chase lands were reduced as parts were enclosed to become private property.

Sometime in the 1230s, a descendant of Ralph, Roger de Somery, fenced off part of the Chase to create "New Park" in order to breed deer for hunting. This area of England is in the [[Black Country]] region and was rich in industrial materials including coal, iron ore, clay and fire-clay. Coal mining had been carried out in the Chase since the 13th century at least, producing an income for the Lords of Dudley whilst they continued to use the Chase for hunting. 

Iron-making and forging was introduced into the area in Tudor times and exploitation of the underground minerals was a great source of wealth for the Sutton and Ward families, who were the successors of the de Somerys. Although by the 17th century the ancient woodlands had largely been cleared &lt;ref name="Birm Post"/&gt; new plantations of trees ensured a supply of wood to produce charcoal for the local iron industry. &lt;ref name="Birm Post"/&gt;

The construction of the Stourbridge Canal across the Chase in 1776 made the area more attractive to industrial exploitation. &lt;ref name=Township/&gt; Enclosure of the common lands occurred in 1784 and the land parcelled out to private owners, including the Lords of Dudley. Although this enclosure brought about the formal end of the Chase lands, the name Pensnett Chase was still applied to the area well into the 19th century. For example, in an edition of the Worcester Chronicle from 1850, it was reported 'St Mark's, Pensnett, a beautiful church built in a wood called Pensnett Chase near to Dudley ...'&lt;ref name="Pensnett St Marks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guttery|first1=D.R.|title=The Story of Pensnett Chase|date=1967|publisher=County Borough of Dudley Libraries Museums and Arts Department|location=Dudley, UK.|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The PMP was created as a political foundation in March 2013 by supporters of then president [[Traian Băsescu]], following his break with the leadership of the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PDL) around former Senate speaker [[Vasile Blaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/basescu-ever-closer-to-the-people%E2%80%99s-movement-pdl-takes-distance-from-him/ |author=Daniela Baragan |title=Basescu ever closer to the People’s Movement, PDL takes distance from him |publisher=NineO'Clock.ro |date=8 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409113230/http://www.nineoclock.ro/basescu-ever-closer-to-the-people%e2%80%99s-movement-pdl-takes-distance-from-him/ |archivedate=9 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was transformed into a political party in July 2013&lt;ref name="Act240713"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://actmedia.eu/daily/popular-movement-party-pmp-officially-registered/47259 |title=Popular Movement Party (PMP) officially registered |publisher=ActMedia.eu |date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-launched on 29 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/people%E2%80%99s-movement-party-aims-re-launching/ |author=Alina Grigoras |title=People’s Movement Party aims re-launching |publisher=NineO'Clock.ro |date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The PMP identifies itself as [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]].&lt;ref name="Act240713"/&gt; The new party's chairman after June 2014 was former minister of regional development and tourism and Băsescu's confidante [[Elena Udrea]]. Other notable members include former culture minister [[Theodor Paleologu]], former foreign minister [[Teodor Baconschi]], former minister of education [[Daniel Funeriu]], member of European Parliament (MEP) [[Cristian Preda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/basescu-starts-electoral-offensive-through-popular-movement/ |author=Alina Grigoras |title=Basescu starts electoral offensive through Popular Movement |publisher=NineO'Clock.ro |date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Băsescu's daughter and MEP [[Elena Băsescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gandul.info/politica/elena-basescu-s-a-inscris-in-pmp-dar-nu-va-candida-la-europarlamentare-cum-s-a-incurcat-eba-la-testul-electoral-12322157 |title=Elena Băsescu s-a înscris în PMP, dar NU va candida la europarlamentare.

|publisher=NineOclock.Ro |date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Romania)|2014 European election]], the party won 6.2% of the votes and two of Romania's 32 seats. Its [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] [[Siegfried Mureșan]] and [[Cristian Preda]] joined the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party Group]], although Preda has since been expelled from the party. On 12 September 2014, the PMP was admitted as a full member to the [[European People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=EPP concerned over actions of radical Islamic militant groups and over latest political developments in Romania; welcomes five new member parties |publisher=European People's Party |date=12 September 2014 |url=http://www.epp.eu/epp-concerned-over-actions-radical-islamic-militant-groups-and-over-latest-political-developments |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413072435/http://www.epp.eu/epp-concerned-over-actions-radical-islamic-militant-groups-and-over-latest-political-developments |archivedate=13 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Romanian presidential election, 2014|November 2014 presidential election]], the PMP nominated Elena Udrea. She was also endorsed by the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚCD). With 5.2% of the popular vote, she was placed fourth and did not qualify for the second round.  The party asked its voters to support [[Klaus Iohannis]] of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] in the runoff election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Udrea ultim îndemn către electoratul PMP pentru a vota cu Iohannis |url=http://www.paginadepolitica.ro/udrea-ultim-indemn-catre-trupele-pmp-pentru-a-vota-cu-johannis/ |newspaper=PaginadePolitică.ro |date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2016, Traian Băsescu announced that the [[National Union for the Progress of Romania]] (UNPR) would merge with PMP on 20 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/unpr-fuzioneaza-prin-absorbtie-cu-pmp-basescu-gabriel-oprea-ramane-doar-cu-onoarea-partidul-nu-mai-e-dupa-fuziune-partidul-se-va-numi-partidul-miscarea-populara-15525263|title=UNPR fuzionează prin absorbţie cu PMP/ Băsescu: Gabriel Oprea rămâne doar cu onoarea, partidul nu mai e după fuziune.

A '''''pied-à-terre''''' ({{IPA-fr|pjetaˈtɛʁ}}; [[French language|French]] for "foot on the ground") is a small living unit usually located in a large [[city]] some distance away from an individual's primary residence. It may be an [[apartment]] or [[condominium]].

The term ''pied-à-terre'' implies usage as a temporary second residence (but not a vacation home), either for part of the year or part of the work week, by a reasonably wealthy person.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Woolsey |first=Matt |date=May 11, 2007 |title=Choice Cities for a Pied-A-Terre|url=https://www.forbes.com/realestate/2007/05/10/homes-cities-pied-forbeslife-cx_mw_0511pied.html |magazine=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the owner's primary residence is nearby, a ''pied-à-terre'' implies a secondary residence within the city which allows the owner to use their primary residence as a vacation home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Gustav |date=2004 |title=Second homes and local development: Issues arising from Cape Town’s De Waterkant |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:GEJO.0000034733.80648.88 |journal=GeoJournal |volume=60 |pages=260 |doi= |access-date=15 October 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power Politics (game)''' is a [[Government simulation game]] published by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] who obtained it from [[Will Vinton]]’s [[Cineplay Interactive]]. Vinton was famous for [[Claymation]] featuring the [[California Raisins]].

Version I featured the 1992 United States Presidential election.

Version II was re-branded as The [[Doonesbury Election Campaign]], essentially the same game, but starring the characters from the [[Doonesbury]] comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/games/the-doonesbury-election-game-141953/pc-659635 IGN: The Doonesbury Election Game]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Power Politics III'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/power-politics-iii/ |title=Power Politics III (PC) |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205103507/http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/power-politics-iii/ |archivedate=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring then current candidates, stronger graphics and online competitions.

The game simulated the real world so well that the Associated Press printed its "simulated" results predicting a victory by Bill Clinton in the 1992 elections. [[George Magazine]] ran a feature article on it in their premier edition.

While it is a worthwhile and challenging simulation for gamers, Power Politics also found its way into classrooms in over 400 colleges and universities, including [[George Washington University]] of [[Washington DC]] as a tool for teaching the realities and complexities of political campaign management. The game won numerous awards for content, quality and creativity.

A player can campaign for one of thirty previous presidential candidates in an attempt to create an alternate history.

A player can ''create'' a political candidate with specified strengths and weaknesses, defining how liberal or conservative the candidate will be; select positions on the important issues; set the schedule; determine what type of advertising campaign will be run and how much to spend on it. Selecting a running mate is part of the game simulation.

Players can also do “what-if” scenarios just to test how candidates would have done against different opponents from different eras and political climates, rather than the one in which the candidate really lived. The historical cut-off is the 1960 campaign, the first in which television was an important factor. FDR vs JFK” or “Adlai Stevenson vs H. Ross Perot” would not work because FDR and Stevenson were candidates before 1960. Similarly pitting JFK against Lyndon Johnson would not work because they were from the same party. However a JFK vs Bob Dole or Jimmy Carter vs George HW Bush would work because they were real candidates, from 1960 and after.

== Development, Current Status ==
The game was developed by Randy Chase, who obtained all rights to the earlier versions and was planning to bring the game forward to apply to the 2008 presidential election, but died of heart failure and complications of diabetes at age 53.

==Reception==
In a 1994 survey of wargames ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave ''Power Politics'' two-plus stars out of five, criticizing the requirement that all historical candidates run in 1992 ("[[Quemoy-Matsu crisis|Quemoy and Matsu]] do not translate well into contemporary economic issues").&lt;ref name="brooks199401"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.

{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}
'''''Qui pluribus''''' (On Faith And Religion) was an [[encyclical]] promulgated by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1846.&lt;ref name="quiplur"&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9quiplu.htm ''Qui pluribus'']&lt;/ref&gt; It disputed the belief that reason should be put above faith. 

It singled out the free gift of [[anti-Catholic]] [[Bible]]s. Its coupling of [[political liberalism]] and [[religious indifferentism]] is seen as a condemnation of the Italian [[Carbonari]] in particular and [[Freemasonry]] in general but it did not mention Freemasonry directly.&lt;ref name="mcinvale"&gt;"While not mentioning Masonry directly, it criticizes those it does not identify for those same faults that the previous papal pronouncements imputed to Freemasonry, and is regarded as an anti-Masonic pronouncement by some Catholic sources." [http://www.bessel.org/cathtlor.htm Roman Catholic Church Law Regarding Freemasonry] by Reid McInvale, Texas Lodge of Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Religious pluralism===
Its opposition to religious pluralism was similar to previous encyclicals, most especially ''[[Mirari vos]]'', issued by [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. Some have argued that the condemnations were softened somewhat by the declaration of the Second Vatican Council ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'', but others see no change.

===Opposition to Freemasonry===
The Catholic Church's prohibition of membership in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] organizations is considered to be still in force. However, [[canon law]] does not state so directly, but its abstract implies so.

'''Social interpretations of race''' regard the common [[Race (human categorization)|categorizations of people into different races]], often with [[Biological determinism|biologist]] tagging of particular "racial" attributes beyond mere anatomy, as more socially and culturally determined than based upon biology. Some interpretations are often [[deconstruction]]ist and [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] in that they critically analyze the [[Historical race concepts|historical construction and development of racial categories]].

{{Race}}

==Social interpretation of physical variation==

=== Incongruities of racial classifications===
Marks (1995) argued that even as the idea of "race" was becoming a powerful organizing principle in many societies, the shortcomings of the concept were apparent. In the Old World, the gradual transition in appearances from one racial group to adjacent racial groups emphasized that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them," as Blumenbach observed in his writings on human variation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marks, ''Human Biodiversity: Genes, Race, and History (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1995), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the Americas, the situation was somewhat different. The immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World—western and northern Europe, western Africa, and, later, eastern Asia and southern and eastern Europe. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to [[miscegenation|mix]] among themselves and with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] inhabitants of the continent. In the United States, for example, most people who self-identify as African American have some European ancestors—in one analysis of genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ∼23% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parra | first1 = Esteban J. | year = 1998 | title = Estimating African American Admixture Proportions by Use of Population-Specific Alleles | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 1839–51 | doi=10.1086/302148 | pmid=9837836 | pmc=1377655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of college students who self-identified as [[White people|white]] in a northeastern U.S. university, the west African and Native American genetic contribution were 0.7% and 3.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shriver | first1 = Mark D. | year = 2003 | title = Skin Pigmentation, Biogeographical Ancestry, and Admixture Mapping | doi = 10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y | pmid = 12579416 | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 387–99 | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time that forced individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Gossett, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'', New ed. (New York: Oxford University, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the "[[one-drop rule]]" implemented in some state laws that treated anyone with a single known African American ancestor as black.&lt;ref&gt;F. James Davis, ''Who is Black?: One Nation's Definition'' (University Park PA: State University of Pennsylvania, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the United States also created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into those categories.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nobles, ''Shades of Citizenship: Race and the Census in Modern Politics'' (Stanford: Stanford University, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was more extensive, social non racial categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid, with people moving into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner, ''Race Mixture in the History of Latin America'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to sort the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete racial categories generated many difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Spickard, "The illogic of American racial categories," in M.P.P. Root, ed., ''Racially mixed people in America'' (Newbury Park CA: Sage, 1992), 12–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, efforts to track mixing between census racial groups led to a proliferation of categories (such as [[mulatto]] and [[octoroon]]) and "blood quantum" distinctions that became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A person's racial identity can change over time. One study found differences between self-ascribed race and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] administrative data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kressin | first1 = N.R. | display-authors = etal   | date = Oct 2003 | title = Agreement between administrative data and patients' self-reports of race/ethnicity | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 10| pages = 1734–9 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.10.1734| pmid = 14534230 | pmc = 1448042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race as a social construct and populationism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
{{weasel|section|date=October 2013}}}}

The notion of a biological basis for race originally emerged through speculations surrounding the "blood purity" of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition, eventually translating to a general association of one's biology with their social and personal characteristics. In the 19th century, this recurring ideology was intensified in the development of the racial sciences, eugenics and ethnology, which meant to further categorize groups of humans in terms of biological superiority or inferiority.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking the Color Line: Readings in Race and Ethnicity|last=Gallagher|first=Charles A.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-0078026638|location=|pages=|chapter="Defining Race and Ethnicity"|quote="In the nineteenth century, race and racial differences were the preeminent concerns of the racial sciences, eugenics and ethnology, better known today as scientific racism.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field of racial sciences, also known as [[scientific racism]], has expired in history, these antiquated conceptions of race have persisted throughout the 21st century. (See also: [[Race (human categorization)|Historical origins of racial classification]])

Contrary to popular belief that the division of the human species based on physical variations is natural, there exists no clear, reliable distinctions that bind people to such groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/|title=Race Is a Social Construct, Scientists Argue|last=Gannon,LiveScience|first=Megan|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Anthropological Association]], "Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic "racial" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583.|title=AAA Statement on Race|last=Smedley|first=Audrey|date=May 17, 1998|website=American Anthropological Association|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Kind: Who We Are, Where We Came From, Where We Are Going|last=Harris|first=Marvin|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York|pages=112–114|quote=|via=http://homepage.smc.edu/delpiccolo_guido/Soc34/Soc34readings/HOW%20OUR%20SKINS%20GOT%20THEIR%20COLOR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups – meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a "pure" ancestry as obsolete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial Formation in the United States|last=Omi|first=Michael|last2=Winant|first2=Howard|publisher=Routledge|year=1986|isbn=978-0415520317|location=|pages=|chapter=Racial Formations|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even those who reject the formal concept of race, however, still use the word ''race'' in day-to-day speech. This may either be a matter of [[semantics]], or an effect of an underlying cultural significance of race in racist societies. Regardless of the name, a working concept of sub-species grouping can be useful, because in the absence of cheap and widespread genetic tests, various race-linked gene mutations (see [[Cystic fibrosis]], [[Lactose intolerance]], [[Tay–Sachs disease]] and [[Sickle cell anemia]]) are difficult to address without recourse to a category between "individual" and "species". As genetic tests for such conditions become cheaper, and as detailed [[haplotype]] maps and [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] databases become available, identifiers of race should diminish. Also, increasing interracial marriage is reducing the predictive power of race. For example, babies born with [[Tay-Sachs disease]] in North America are not only or primarily Ashkenazi Jews, despite stereotypes to contrary; French Canadians, Louisiana Cajuns, and Irish-Americans also see high rates of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tay-sachs.org/taysachs_disease.php|title=Tay-sachs Disease :: National Tay-Sachs &amp; Allied Diseases Association of Delaware Valley (NTSAD-DV)|website=www.tay-sachs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in the fields of genetics, law, and [[sociology]] have offered their opinions on the subject. Audrey Smedley and [[Brian D. Smedley]] of Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smedley|first1=Audrey|last2=Smedley|first2=Brian D.|title=Race as Biology Is Fiction, Racism as a Social Problem Is Real|date=1994|pages=16–26|url=http://aaronhood.net/wp-content/SocialConstructionRace.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the anthropological and historical perspectives on ethnicity, culture, and race. They define culture as the habits acquired by a society. Smedley states "Ethnicity and culture are related phenomena and bear no intrinsic connection to human biological variations or race" (Smedley 17). The authors state using physical characteristics to define an ethnic identity is inaccurate. The variation of humans has actually decreased over time since, as the author states, "Immigration, intermating, intermarriage, and reproduction have led to increasing physical heterogeneity of peoples in many areas of the world" (Smedley 18). They referred to other experts and their research, pointing out that humans are 99% alike. That one percent is caused by natural genetic variation, and has nothing to do with the ethnic group of the subject. Racial classification in the United States started in the 1700s with three ethnically distinct groups. These groups were the white Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. The concept of race was skewed around these times because of the social implications of belonging to one group or another. The view that one race is biologically different from another rose out of society's grasp for power and authority over other ethnic groups. This did not only happen in the United States but around the world as well. Society created race to create hierarchies in which the majority would prosper most.
 
Another group of experts in sociology has written on this topic. Guang Guo, Yilan Fu, Yi Li, Kathleen Mullan Harris of the University of North Carolina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Guang|last2=Yilan|first2=Fu|last3=Hedwig|first3=Lee|last4=Tianji|first4=Cai|last5=Li|first5=Yi|last6=Harris|first6=Kathleen Mullan|title=Recognizing a Small Amount of Superficial Genetic Differences across African, European and Asian Americans Helps Understand Social Construction of Race|journal=Demography, December 2014|date=2014|volume=51|issue=6|pages=2337–2342|doi=10.1007/s13524-014-0349-y|pmid=25421523}}&lt;/ref&gt; department of sociology as well as Hedwig Lee (University of Washington Seattle), Tianji Cai (University of Macau) comment on remarks made by one expert. The debate is over DNA differences, or lack thereof, between different races. The research in the original article they are referring to uses different methods of DNA testing between distinct ethnic groups and compares them to other groups. Small differences were found, but those were not based on race. They were from biological differences caused from the region in which the people live. They describe that the small differences cannot be fully explained because the understanding of migration, intermarriage, and ancestry is unreliable at the individual level. Race cannot be related to ancestry based on the research on which they are commenting. They conclude that the idea of "races as biologically distinct peoples with differential abilities and behaviors has long been discredited by the scientific community" (2338).

One more expert in the field has given her opinion. Ann Morning of the New York University Department of Sociology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morning|first1=Ann|title=Does Genomics Challenge the Social Construction of Race?|journal=Sociological Theory|date=2014|volume=32|issue=3|pages=189–207|url=http://stx.sagepub.com/content/32/3/189|accessdate=13 April 2015|doi=10.1177/0735275114550881}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the [[American Sociological Association]], discusses the role of biology in the social construction of race. She examines the relationship between genes and race and the social construction of social race clusters. Morning states that everyone is assigned to a racial group because of their physical characteristics. She identifies through her research the existence of DNA population clusters.  She states that society would want to characterize these clusters as races. Society characterizes race as a set of physical characteristics. The clusters though have an overlap in physical characteristics and thus cannot be counted as a race by society or by science. Morning concludes that "Not only can constructivist theory accommodate or explain the occasional alignment of social classifications and genetic estimates that Shiao et al.'s model hypothesizes, but empirical research on human genetics is far from claiming—let alone demonstrating—that statistically inferred clusters are the equivalent of races" (Morning 203). Only using ethnic groups to map a genome is entirely inaccurate, instead every individual must be viewed as having their own wholly unique genome (unique in the 1%, not the 99% all humans share).

Ian Haney López, the John H. Boalt Professor of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney Lopez|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of Race|journal=Critical Race Theory|date=1994|pages=191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains ways race is a social construct. He uses examples from history of how race was socially constructed and interpreted. One such example was of the [[Hudgins v. Wright]] case. A slave woman sued for her freedom and the freedom of her two children on the basis that her grandmother was Native American. The race of the Wright had to be socially proven, and neither side could present enough evidence. Since the slave owner Hudgins bore the burden of proof, Wright and her children gained their freedom. López uses this example to show the power of race in society. Human fate, he argues, still depends upon ancestry and appearance. Race is a powerful force in everyday life. These races are not determined by biology though, they are created by society to keep power with the majority. He describes that there are not any genetic characteristics that all blacks have that non-whites do not possess and vice versa. He uses the example of Mexican. It truly is a nationality, yet it has become a catch-all for all Hispanic nationalities. This simplification is wrong, López argues, for it is not only inaccurate but it tends to treat all "Mexicans" as below fervent Americans. He describes that "More recently, genetic testing has made it clear the close connections all humans share, as well as the futility of explaining those differences that do exist in terms of racially relevant gene codes" (Lopez 199–200). Those differences clearly have no basis in ethnicity, so race is completely socially constructed.

Through this small sampling of experts, it is clear that race as a social construction is a common theory. All of the experts in this sampling say that biological race is non-existent. Race therefore must have been created by societies. They were created to do what humans do, to serve the purposes of the majority. The hierarchies created by race have kept the majority "race" in control of everything from public policy to the workforce to law enforcement. They benefit from this construction of race. Yet, the minorities, who are just the same genetically, suffer under this system. Most of the points made by the experts expose this issue, yet none truly suggest a way to fix the problem. Bill Nye weighs in on the issue on the same side as the experts in the sample. He says that humans are humans, we are all one species. We have to fix it. If society created the problem, society has to take it on itself to fix it.

Some{{who|date=October 2013}} argue it is preferable when considering biological relations to think in terms of populations, and when considering cultural relations to think in terms of [[ethnicity]], rather than of race.

These developments had important consequences. For example, some scientists{{who|date=October 2013}} developed the notion of "population" to take the place of race. It is argued that this substitution is not simply a matter of exchanging one word for another.

This view does not deny that there are physical differences among peoples; it simply claims that the historical conceptions of "race" are not particularly useful in accounting for these differences scientifically. In particular, it is claimed{{by whom|date=October 2013}} that:

# knowing someone's "race" does not provide comprehensive predictive information about biological characteristics, and only absolutely predicts those traits that have been selected to define the racial categories, e.g. knowing a person's skin color, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the markers of race (or taken as a defining characteristic of race), does not allow good predictions of a person's blood type to be made.
# in general, the worldwide distribution of human phenotypes exhibits gradual trends of difference across geographic zones, not the categorical differences of race; in particular, there are many peoples (like the San of S. W. Africa, or the people of northern India) who have phenotypes that do not neatly fit into the standard race categories.
# focusing on race has historically led not only to seemingly insoluble disputes about classification (e.g. are the Japanese a distinct race, a mixture of races, or part of the East Asian race? and what about the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]?) but has also exposed disagreement about the criteria for making decisions—the selection of phenotypic traits seemed arbitrary.

[[Neven Sesardic]] has argued that such arguments are unsupported by empirical evidence and politically motivated. Arguing that races are not completely discrete biologically is a [[straw man]] argument. He argues "racial recognition is not actually based on a single trait (like skin color) but rather on a number of characteristics that are to a certain extent concordant and that jointly make the classification not only possible but fairly reliable as well". Forensic anthropologists can classify a person's race with an accuracy close to 100% using only skeletal remains if they take into consideration several characteristics at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sesardic | first1 = Neven | title = Race: a social destruction of a biological concept | doi = 10.1007/s10539-009-9193-7 | journal = Biology &amp; Philosophy | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–162 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.638.939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.W.F. Edwards]] has argued similarly regarding genetic differences in "[[Human genetic diversity: Lewontin's fallacy]]".

===Race and intelligence===
{{Main article|Race and intelligence}}
Researchers have reported significant differences in the average [[IQ]] test scores of various racial groups. The interpretation and causes of these differences are controversial, as researchers disagree about whether this gap is caused by genetic differences. The social interpretations of the race concept is incompatible with the idea that the IQ gap between racial groups is caused by genetic factors, and those who see race as a social construction posit purely environmental and sociological explanations for the gap. Such explanations include different access to education for different racial groups, different social attitudes towards test-taking, [[stereotype threat]], lack of [[effort optimism]] due to low social status and many other proposed explanations. For example, psychologist [[Jefferson Fish]] argues that race is a social construction and argues that for this reason the question of racial differences in intelligence is not scientific, though his opinion has been repeatedly disproven. For example, one might want to compare black-white IQ differences in Brazil with those in the United States. Since many people who are considered black in the U. S. would not be considered black in Brazil, and since many people who are considered white in Brazil would not be considered white in the U. S., such a comparison is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (Ed.)  (2002).  Race and intelligence: Separating science from myth.  Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Richard Lynn]], however, in his book ''[[Race Differences in Intelligence (book)|Race Differences in Intelligence]]'' does not define races based on current social classification but on ancestral populations. Many current ethnic groups would be mixtures of several races in this classification. [[Arthur Jensen]] and [[J. Philippe Rushton]] have also defined race based on ancestral home, although somewhat differently from Lynn, when speaking of Black–White–East Asian IQ differences in the US. "Blacks (Africans, Negroids) are those who have most of their ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa; Whites (Europeans, Caucasoids) have most of their ancestors from Europe; and East Asians (Orientals, Mongoloids) have most of their ancestors from Pacific Rim countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Rushton| first1 = J.

===Race in biomedicine===
{{Main article|Race in biomedicine}}
There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. The primary impetus for considering race in biomedical research is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics. The most well-known examples of genetically determined disorders that vary in incidence between ethnic groups would be [[sickle cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]] among black and [[Mediterranean]] populations respectively and [[Tay–Sachs disease]] among people of [[Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent. Some fear that the use of racial labels in biomedical research runs the risk of unintentionally exacerbating health disparities, so they suggest alternatives to the use of racial taxonomies.

==Case studies in the social construction of race==

===Race in the United States===
{{Main article|Race in the United States}}
In the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African-Americans and European-Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, his fraction of known non-White ancestry, and his social circle.&lt;ref&gt;See "Chapter 9.

====Race definitions in the United States====
{{Main article|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census}}
The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify. These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They change from one census to another, and the racial categories include both racial and national-origin groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm "American Indian and Alaska Native persons, percent, 2000"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207222529/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm |date=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race in Brazil===
{{Main article|Race in Brazil}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazil]] was characterized by a relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. This pattern reflects a different history and different [[social relations]]. Basically, [[Demographics of Brazil|race in Brazil]] was recognized as the difference between ancestry (which determines genotype) and phenotypic differences. Racial identity was not governed by a rigid descent rule. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Over a dozen racial categories are recognized in conformity with the combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred to appearance, not heredity.

Through this system of racial identification, parents and children and even brothers and sisters were frequently accepted as representatives of opposite racial types. In a fishing village in the state of [[Bahia]], an investigator showed 100 people pictures of three sisters and they were asked to identify the races of each. In only six responses were the sisters identified by the same racial term. Fourteen responses used a different term for each sister. In another experiment nine portraits were shown to a hundred people. Forty different racial types were elicited. It was found, in addition, that a given Brazilian might be called by as many as thirteen different terms by other members of the community. These terms are spread out across practically the entire spectrum of theoretical racial types. A further consequence of the absence of a descent rule was that Brazilians apparently not only disagreed about the racial identity of specific individuals, but they also seemed to be in disagreement about the abstract meaning of the racial terms as defined by words and phrases. For example, 40% of a sample ranked moreno claro as a lighter type than mulato claro, while 60% reversed this order. A further note of confusion is that one person might employ different racial terms to describe the same person over a short time span. The choice of which racial description to use may vary according to both the personal relationships and moods of the individuals involved. The [[Brazilian census]] lists one's race according to the preference of the person being interviewed. As a consequence, hundreds of races appeared in the census results, ranging from blue (which is blacker than the usual black) to pink (which is whiter than the usual white).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, Brazilians are not so naïve to ignore one's racial origins just because of his (or her) better social status. An interesting example of this phenomenon has occurred recently, when the famous [[association football|football (soccer)]] player [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] declared publicly that he considered himself as [[White people|White]], thus linking racism to a form or another of [[class conflict]]. This caused a series of ironic notes on newspapers, which pointed out that he should have been proud of his African origin (which is obviously noticeable), a fact that must have made life for him (and for his ancestors) more difficult, so, being a successful personality was, in spite of that, a victory for him. What occurs in Brazil that differentiates it largely from the US or South Africa, for example, is that black or mixed-race people are, in fact, more accepted in social circles if they have more education, or have a successful life (a euphemism for "having a better salary"). As a consequence, inter-racial marriages are more common, and more accepted, among highly educated [[Afro-Brazilian]]s than lower-educated ones.

So, although the identification of a person by race is far more fluid and flexible in Brazil than in the U.S., there still are racial stereotypes and prejudices. African features have been considered less desirable; Blacks have been considered socially inferior, and Whites superior. These white [[supremacist]] values were a legacy of European colonization and the slave-based [[plantation system]]. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil is reflective of the extent of [[miscegenation]] in [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazilian society]], which remains highly, but not strictly, [[social stratification|stratified]] along color lines. Henceforth, Brazil's desired image as a perfect "post-racist" country, composed of the "cosmic race" celebrated in 1925 by [[José Vasconcelos]], must be met with caution, as sociologist [[Gilberto Freyre]] demonstrated in 1933 in ''Casa Grande e Senzala''.

===Race in politics and ethics===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
[[Michel Foucault]] argued the popular historical and political use of a non-[[essentialist]] notion of "race" used in the "[[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analyze of the historical and political discourse|race struggle" discourse]] during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] and under [[Louis XIV]]'s end of reign. In Foucault's view, this discourse developed in two different directions: [[Marxism]], which seized the notion and transformed it into "[[class struggle]]" discourse, and [[racism|racists]], biologists and [[eugenicists]], who paved the way for 20th century "[[state racism]]".

During [[the Enlightenment]], racial classifications were used to justify [[slavery|enslavement]] of those deemed to be of "inferior", non-White races, and thus supposedly best fitted for lives of toil under White supervision. These classifications made the distance between races seem nearly as broad as that between species, easing unsettling questions about the appropriateness of such treatment of humans. The practice was at the time generally accepted by both scientific and lay communities.

[[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) was one of the milestones in the new [[racist]] [[discourse]], along with [[Vacher de Lapouge]]'s "anthroposociology" and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803), who applied race to [[nationalism|nationalist]] theory to develop militant [[ethnic nationalism]]. They posited the historical existence of national races such as German and French, branching from basal races supposed to have existed for millennia, such as the [[Aryan race]], and believed political boundaries should mirror these supposed racial ones.

Later, one of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s favorite sayings was, "Politics is applied biology". Hitler's ideas of racial purity led to unprecedented atrocities in Europe. Since then, [[ethnic cleansing]] has occurred in [[Cambodia]], the [[Balkans]], [[darfur conflict|Sudan]], and [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]]. In one sense, ''ethnic cleansing'' is another name for the tribal warfare and mass murder that has afflicted human society for ages.

Racial inequality has been a concern of United States politicians and legislators since the country's founding. In the 19th century most White Americans (including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s) explained racial inequality as an inevitable consequence of biological differences. Since the mid-20th century, political and civic leaders as well as scientists have debated to what extent racial inequality is cultural in origin. Some argue that current inequalities between Blacks and Whites are primarily cultural and historical, the result of past and present racism, [[slavery]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and could be redressed through such programs as [[affirmative action]] and [[Head Start program|Head Start]]. Others work to reduce tax funding of remedial programs for minorities. They have based their advocacy on aptitude test data that, according to them, shows that racial ability differences are biological in origin and cannot be leveled even by intensive educational efforts. In [[Election|electoral politics]], many more ethnic minorities have won important offices in Western nations than in earlier times, although the highest offices tend to remain in the hands of Whites.

In his famous ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'', [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] observed:
:History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Letter From Birmingham City Jail (Excerpts) |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/letter-from-birmingham-city-jail-excerpts/ |title=Letter From Birmingham City Jail (Excerpts) |publisher=Teaching American History |date=1963-04-16 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's hope, expressed in his [[I Have a Dream]] speech, was that the [[civil rights]] struggle would one day produce a society where people were not "judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character".

Because of the identification of the concept of race with political oppression, many natural and social scientists today are wary of using the word "race" to refer to human variation, but instead use less emotive words such as "population" and "ethnicity". Some, however, argue that the concept of race, whatever the term used, is nevertheless of continuing utility and validity in scientific research. Science and politics frequently take opposite sides in debates that relate to human intelligence and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suhay|first=Elizabeth|last2=Jayaratne|first2=Toby Epstein|date=2013|title=Does Biology Justify Ideology?

==Race in law enforcement==

In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of [[law enforcement officer]]s seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of law enforcement officers, a description needs to capture the features that stand out most clearly in the perception within the given society.

Thus, in the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] use a classification based on the [[ethnic groups in the UK|ethnic composition]] of [[British society]]: W1 ([[White British]]), W2 ([[White Irish]]), W9 ([[Other White]]); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other).

In the United States, the practice of [[racial profiling]] has been ruled to be both [[unconstitutional]] and also to constitute a violation of [[civil rights]]. There also an ongoing debate on the relationship between [[Race and crime in the United States|race and crime]] regarding the disproportional representation of certain minorities in all stages of the criminal justice system.

Studies in racial taxonomy based on DNA cluster analysis (See [[Lewontin's Fallacy]]) has led law enforcement to pursue suspects based on their racial classification as derived from their DNA evidence left at the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115054204/http://transobj.workopolis.com/servlet/Content/fasttrack/20050625/DNA25?section=Biotech|url=http://transobj.workopolis.com:80/servlet/Content/fasttrack/20050625/DNA25?section=Biotech|title=Molecular eyewitness: DNA gets a human face Controversial crime-scene test smacks of racial profiling, critics say - workopolis.com|archivedate=15 November 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis has been successful in helping police determine the race of both victims and perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-16-dna_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=DNA tests detect race | first1=Richard | last1=Willing | date=2005-08-16 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rankism''' is "abusive, discriminatory, or exploitative behavior towards people because of their [[Social class|rank]] in a particular [[hierarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Fuller
  | first = Robert
  | title = Rankism: A Social Disorder

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as [[bullying]], [[racism]], [[hazing]], [[ageism]], [[sexism]], [[ableism]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. The term "rankism" was coined by physicist, educator, and [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen diplomat]] [[Robert W. Fuller]].

== Characteristics ==

Rankism can take many forms, including
* exploiting one's position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits (e.g. massive corporate bonuses);
* abusing a position of power (e.g., abusive [[parental abuse of children|parent]] or [[Religious abuse|priest]], [[Corporate corruption|corrupt CEO]], [[Workplace bullying|bully boss]], [[prisoner abuse]]);
* using rank as a shield to get away with [[insulting]] or [[humiliating]] others with impunity;
* using rank to maintain a position of power long after it can be justified;
* exporting the rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior value as a person;
* exploiting rank that is illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank, such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], or [[classism]]).

Rankism can occur in any [[social hierarchy]], such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of term ==

The term rankism first appeared in print in the ''Oberlin Alumni Magazine'' for fall of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | year = Fall 1997
 | title = Campus Activities (sidebar)
 | journal = Oberlin Alumni Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in a book called ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank,'' written by Fuller and published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2003
 | title = Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank
 | publisher = New Society Publishers
 | location = Gabriola Island, Canada
 | isbn = 0-86571-486-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001 in a ''[[Leader to Leader Institute]]'' article. The piece questioned the abuse of rank in work hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W
 |date=Summer 2001
 | title = A New Look at Hierarchy: How do we make sure that rank is exercised appropriately?
 | journal = Leader to Leader
 | volume = 21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of rankism has since been widely covered in the media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[C-SPAN]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Voice of America]]'', and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.

Other notable references of rankism include Fuller's second book on the subject, ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2006
 | title = All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity
 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1-57675-385-9 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and an action-oriented guide titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 |author2=Pamela A. Gerloff

 | nopp = true
 | page = back cover 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies]] (HumanDHS) network has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to its mission. It asserts, "...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2008-09-24
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach, Julie Ann (2008). ''Battles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and At Home''. Brookside Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9814818-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankism and dignity ==

According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their [[dignity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Robert
  | title = Dignity: A Universal Right
  | url=http://www.breakingranks.net/weblog/dignity
  | accessdate = 2008-09-16
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and his supporters have launched a new [[social movement]] to promote the creation of a dignitarian society. The Dignity Movement's goal is to overcome rankism in the same way that the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[feminist movement|women's movements]] targeted racism and sexism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6007">The '''Red Line Agreement''' is an agreement signed by partners in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC) on July 31, 1928. The aim of the agreement was to formalize the corporate structure of IPC and bind all partners to a "self-denial clause" that prohibited any of its shareholders from independently seeking oil interests in the ex-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territory. It marked the creation of an oil [[monopoly]], or [[cartel]], of immense influence, spanning a vast territory. The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]), which was formed in 1960.

As Giacomo Luciani (2013) writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Having formed IPC, [Calouste] Gulbenkian insisted that participants in the consortium sign what became known as the Red Line Agreement (Yergin 1991: 203–6). The red line was drawn on a map to define the territories formerly under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, and the agreement stated that participants in the IPC consortium pledged to be involved in the exploita- tion of any oil to be discovered within the red line exclusively through consortia with the same composition as the IPC. Hence, if one of the IPC consortium members were to discover any oil or obtain a concession elsewhere within the red line, it would have to offer this asset to the remaining members in the same ‘geometry’ as in the IPC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luciani|first=Giacomo|title=Corporations vs. States in the Shaping of Global Oil Regimes|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137349149_7|work=Global Resources|pages=119–139|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137349149_7|isbn=9781349347827|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It has been said that, at a meeting in 1928, [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], an [[Armenia]]n businessman and philanthropist, drew a red line on a map of the Middle East demarcating the boundaries of the area where the self-denial clause would be in effect.&lt;ref&gt;"The Emergence of the Arabian Oil Industry" by Rasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., University of Utah's Energy &amp; Geoscience Institute, ''GeoExpro'', No. 6 of 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Gulbenkian said this was the boundary of the Ottoman Empire he knew in 1914. He should know, he added, because he was born in it and lived in it. The other partners looked on it attentively and did not object. They had already anticipated such a boundary. (According to some accounts, the “red line” was not drawn by Gulbenkian but by a [[France|French]] representative.) Except for Gulbenkian, the partners were the [[supermajors]] of today. Within the “red line” lie the entire ex-Ottoman territory in the [[Middle East]] including the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (plus [[Turkey]]) but excluding [[Kuwait]]. Kuwait was excluded as it was meant to be a preserve for the British.

Years later, [[Walter C. Teagle]] of [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] remarked that the agreement was “a damn bad move”.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett H. Wall and George S. Gibb, ''Teagle of Jersey Standard'', New Orleans, 1974, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; However, it served to define the sphere of operations of TPC's successor, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC). The writer [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg]], a former IPC employee, noted that "the Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;''Oil in the Middle East'' by S. H. Longrigg, 2nd Edition, published by the Oxford University Press, 1961, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain where [[ARAMCO]] and BAPCO prevailed, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line during this period.

American oil companies [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] and Socony-Vacuum were partners in IPC and therefore bound by the Red Line Agreement.  When they were offered a partnership with ARAMCO to develop the oil resources of Saudi Arabia, their partners in IPC refused to release them from the agreement. After the Americans claimed that World War II had ended the Red Line Agreement, protracted legal proceedings with Gulbenkian followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Yergin]], ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power'', New York, 1991, pp. 413-9&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the case was settled out of court and the American partners were allowed to join ARAMCO.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil: Share the Wealth”, ''Time'', 23 December 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Line Agreement became a legacy document after this date, as IPC continued to operate existing concessions under its terms but the shareholder companies were allowed independently to seek new oil concessions across the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=The Third River: Aspects of Oil in the Middle East 1887-1979|date=2014|publisher=National Archives|location=United Arab Emirates|isbn=978-9948-05-146-6|page=331|edition=First|url=http://www.greenmountainpress.co.uk/iraq_petroleum_the_third_river.html|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], setting out the core political volunteering [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s that would form the main part of the Commonwealth's [[Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria|membership criteria]].  The Declaration was issued in Singapore on 22 January 1971 at the conclusion of the first [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/sites/default/files/history-items/documents/Singapore%20Declaration.pdf |date=22 January 1971 |title=Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles 1971 |accessdate=9 Aug 2014 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Harare Declaration]], issued in 1991, it is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth's [[uncodified constitution|uncodified]] constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/key_declarations/ |title=Key Declarations |accessdate=25 July 2007 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819010922/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/key_declarations/ |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration opens with a description of the Commonwealth's identity, the relationship between the organisation and its members, and its fundamental goals:

{{quote|The Commonwealth of Nations is a [[voluntary association]] of [[Independence|independent]] sovereign states, each responsible for its own policies, consulting and co-operating in the common interests of their peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text" /&gt;}}

The second article describes the extent and diversity of the Commonwealth, encompassing both rich nations and poor across six continents and five oceans.&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text" /&gt; The third article states, at the height of the [[Cold War]], that membership of the Commonwealth is compatible with membership of any other [[international organization|international organisation]] or non-alignment.&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text" /&gt;

The next ten articles in turn detail some of the core political principles of the Commonwealth.  These include (in the order in which they are mentioned): [[world peace]] and support for the United Nations; [[individual liberty]] and [[egalitarianism]]; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and [[economic inequality]]; [[free trade]]; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international [[coercion]].&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text" /&gt;

These are summed up in the final article, which serves as a touchstone for Commonwealth principles:

{{quote|These relationships we intend to foster and extend, for we believe that our multi-national association can expand human understanding and understanding among nations, assist in the elimination of discrimination based on differences of race, colour or creed, maintain and strengthen personal liberty, contribute to the enrichment of life for all, and provide a powerful influence for peace among nations.&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text" /&gt;}}

The part of the declaration considered the most troubling was the very last to be mentioned: 'rejecting coercion as an instrument of policy'.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |date=July 2005 |title=Blair's Britain and the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=94 |issue=380 |pages=381–391 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530500174960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that not even the Commonwealth itself has any right to enforce its other core values, as that would be using coercion.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain" /&gt; This apparent conflict was resolved by the [[Harare Declaration]] and the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], which clearly mandates the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain" /&gt;

==History==
The policy has come into effect on 2 June 2015 by incumbent minister, [[K. T. Rama Rao]] under Commissioner of Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/telangana-state-innovates-to-raise-funds/article22712656.ece Telangana State innovates to raise funds - Business Line&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, ''Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS) Act, 2014” (Act No.3 of 2014)'', was passed in [[Telangana Legislature]].

==The Policy==
A single simplified Common Application Form (CAF) for all department approvals was created for applying for clearance.

The policy has helped the state in bagging top spot in the ''Ease of Doing Business'' rankings. By February 2018, the scheme has attracted more than Rs 1,20,000 crore investments into the State with potential to provide 3,00,000 direct jobs.

{{Legislature}}
'''Tricameralism'''  is the practice of having three [[legislature|legislative]] or [[parliamentary]] chambers. It is contrasted with [[unicameralism]] and [[bicameralism]], both of which are far more common.

The term was used in [[South Africa]] to describe the [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] established under the [[apartheid]] regime's new [[South African Constitution of 1983]]. Other instances of tricameral legislatures in history include [[Simón Bolívar]]'s model state. The word could also describe{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} the [[French Estates-General]], which had three 'estates', as well as the three chambers which comprised the Consular and Napoleonic (1799-1814) legislatures.

==South African tricameralism==
{{Main|Tricameral Parliament}}
In 1983, [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] government put forward a constitution providing for a tricameral legislature. On 2 November, around seventy percent of the country's white population voted in favour of the changes{{snd}}black South Africans were not consulted, and under the proposal they continued to be denied representation since in theory they were citizens of independent or autonomous [[bantustan]]s.

The South African tricameral parliament consisted of three [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-based chambers:

* '''House of Assembly'''{{snd}}178 members, reserved for whites
* '''House of Representatives'''{{snd}}85 members, reserved for [[Coloured]], or mixed-race, people
* '''House of Delegates'''{{snd}}45 members, reserved for [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]

The creation of the tricameral parliament was controversial on two fronts. On the one hand, many white conservatives disliked the idea of non-whites participating in Parliament at all. The dispute was a factor in the creation of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]], a breakaway from the dominant [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. On the other hand, many coloureds and Asians rejected the system as a sham, saying that the chambers reserved for them were powerless.

The tricameral parliament was not particularly strong. The 1983 constitution significantly weakened the powers of parliament, and abolished the position of Prime Minister. Most authority was transferred to the [[State President of South Africa|State President]], including the power to appoint the Cabinet. This was seen by many as an attempt to limit the power of coloureds and Indians{{snd}}not only were the 'non-white' Houses of Parliament less powerful than the 'white' one, but parliament itself was subordinate to a white President.

==Bolívar's tricameralism==
[[Simón Bolívar]], the [[South America]]n revolutionary leader, included a tricameral legislature as part of his proposals for a model government. Bolívar described the three houses as follows:

* '''Chamber of Tribunes''', holding powers relating to government finance, foreign affairs, and war. The tribunes would, unlike the other two houses, be popularly elected.
* '''Senate''', an apolitical body holding powers to enact law, supervise the judiciary, and appoint regional officials. Bolívar believed that the senate should be [[hereditary]], saying that this was the only way to ensure its neutrality. There are parallels between Bolívar's Senate and other chambers such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Lords]].
* '''Censors''', a group who would act as a check against the powers of the other two. Bolívar described them as "prosecuting attorneys against the government in defense of the Constitution and popular rights". He also said that they should ensure that the executive was functioning satisfactorily, perhaps having powers of [[impeachment]].

Bolívar intended his model government to function as a [[parliamentary system]], and so the tricameral parliament was expected to govern through the active administration of the cabinet ministers who would be accountable to it. Bolívar was explicit in many of his writings, particularly in his Message to the [[Congress of Angostura]] on how his proposed system was meant to reflect the way the British parliamentary system works. His proposal for Censors was not for them to act as legislators but rather to act as an office similar to an [[Ombudsman]]. As such, some opinions differ on whether his system could truly be classified as a tricameral parliament, considering that the Censors weren't true legislators, but seemed to represent a separate branch of government altogether.

Despite Bolívar's huge influence in South America, no country in the region employs his tricameral parliament. Early attempts to implement the model, such as in [[Bolivia]], were not successful, although the chaos of the period was likely a factor in this outcome.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} As a result of not adopting Bolívar's British-inspired parliamentary system, numerous celebrated political scientists like the late [[Juan Linz]] and many others have observed that the decision of many Latin American countries to model their systems of government on the [[presidential system]] of the United States has led to numerous examples of political instability and subsequent descent into dictatorship or anarchy.{{cn|reason=a statement like this, especially one citing an author, needs an actual citation.|date=March 2015}}

==French tricameralism==
===Ancien Régime===
Some historians view the [[France|French]] [[French States-General|States-General]] as an example of a tricameral legislature. The States-General evolved gradually over time, and provided advice on various matters (including legislative issues) to the [[King of France|King]]. The three Estates were the simply labeled First (consisting of [[clergy]]), Second (consisting of [[nobility]]), and Third (consisting of [[commoner]]s). (The term "[[fourth estate]]", referring to the press, derives from this system, but was coined long after the revolution that abolished it.)

There are two distinct problems with regarding the States-General as a tricameral legislature, however. First, the States-General never had any formal powers to legislate, although at times, it played a major role in the King's legislative activity. Second, the division between the three estates was not always maintained{{snd}}the estates sometimes deliberated separately, but at other times, they deliberated as a single body, undermining the idea of tricameralism.

===Consulate===
The [[French Consulate]] (and later [[First French Empire]], although the lower two chambers were by then entirely without power) had a tricameral legislature, consisting of:

* the ''[[Sénat conservateur]]'' (''Conservative Senate''), the highest chamber, whose duty was to guard the constitution, and which upon the consul's proposal could enact special laws known as ''sénatus-consultes'',
* the ''[[Corps législatif]]'' (''Legislative body''), successor to the [[French Directory|Directoire]]'s [[Council of Ancients|Conseil des Anciens]] (upper house), which was to vote on laws without discussing them (or, after 1804, with only a strictly curtailed discussion),
* the ''[[Tribune#French revolutionary tribunat|Tribunat]]'', successor of the [[French Directory|Directoire]]'s [[Council of Five Hundred|Conseil des Cinq Cents]] (lower house), which was to discuss laws and only vote on whether to "recommend" them for the Corps législatif.

Whether the Sénat was part of legislature, however, is open to doubt, because [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]] (the main instigator of the Consulate's Constitution and later president of this Senate) described it as belonging to an altogether different power beyond the executive, legislative and judiciary: the ''conservative'' power.  In effect, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon]] made the Sénat into a political élite to back his power as Consul and later as Emperor, whereas the other two chambers were subdued into submission.  In 1807, the Tribunat was definitely abolished.

==Chinese tricameralism==
According to the original [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], now based in Taiwan and the outlying islands (which is drafted according to the idea of Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]]), under the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], there are five branches of government, named Yuan (院), which are: the [[Executive Yuan]], [[Legislative Yuan]], [[Judicial Yuan]], [[Examination Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]].

The National Assembly represented the entire nation and exercised the political rights thereof, but its legislative functions were considered "reserve" powers that were meant to be exercised on an ad-hoc basis; the Legislative Yuan is the principal and standing legislative body, and the Control Yuan is the monitors of the government.

However, the constitution did not mention which is the [[parliament]] of the country. The Judicial Yuan decided that the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan resembled the parliament.

{{Wikisource|zh:釋字第76號}}
Originally, the Control Yuan was elected by indirect election, but since 1992 members are nominated by the President. After the suspension of the National Assembly in 2005, the Legislative Yuan became the current [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]].

==Other examples==

===Former Yugoslavia===
The [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] (according to the provisions of the 1974 Constitution) had three houses of parliament (Sabor Socijalističke republike Hrvatske, now [[Hrvatski sabor]]): Socio-Political Council (Društveno-političko vijeće), Council of Municipalities (Vijeće općina) and Council of Associated Labor (Vijeće udruženog rada). This was abolished by the [[Constitution of Croatia|new constitution]] as [[Croatia]] gained [[Independence of Croatia|independence]] in 1990.

===Isle of Man===
The parliament of the [[Isle of Man]], [[Tynwald]], is sometimes called tricameral, but this description is not universally accepted. The two branches of Tynwald are the [[House of Keys]] and the [[Legislative Council (Isle of Man)|Legislative Council]]. The [[Tynwald Court]] consists of the members of both houses meeting together regularly. Some argue that this counts as a third house. Others disagree, saying that as there are no members of the Court who are not also members of the other houses, the Court should not be considered separately (by comparison, in Australia, Switzerland and India deadlocks between the two Houses can sometimes be resolved by a joint sitting. It is a matter of semantics whether or not such arrangements are described as "tricameral". (Taking the expression literally, Tynwald is tricameral in that there are three separate chambers (rooms) in use for the sessions.)

===Norway===
Similarly, before 2009 the Norwegian parliament (the Storting) split itself into two separate chambers, but for certain purposes the two chambers sat in joint session.

===Church of England===
The [[General Synod]] of the [[Church of England]] is sometimes described as tricameral. It is divided into a House of [[Bishop]]s, the House of [[Clergy]] and the House of [[Laity]]. As the Church of England is the state church of [[England]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] has given the General Synod the power (subject to veto) to make law relating to the Church.

However, a [[Diocesan Synod]] is not a tricameral institution. It is a [[bicameral]] institution, as it consists of the House of [[Laity]], who are directly elected by the parishes, and the House of [[Clergy]]. The Bishop is not a member of either House, even though he is constitutionally a member of Synod.

===Medieval Ireland===
In the fifteenth century, [[secular clergy]] of [[Dioceses of Ireland|each diocese]] sent two proctors to the [[Parliament of Ireland]], who met separately from the [[Irish House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Irish House of Lords|House of Lords]]. In 1537, their right to membership was revoked after they opposed the [[Reformation in Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Irish Parliament Rolls of the Fifteenth Century |first=H.

===Labor unions===
Tricameral meeting arrangements are a growing trend in [[labor unions]] where some members will always be working on one of three shifts. Under such arrangements, each shift will have its own meeting, but the action of one meeting will have to be adopted by the other two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliamentaryprocedure.org/pdf/ShiftMeetings.pdf Meetings of Members Working in Shifts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''use of force by states''' is controlled by both customary international law and by treaty law.  The [[UN Charter]] reads in article 2(4):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the [[United Nations]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This rule was "enshrined in the United Nations Charter in 1945 for a good reason: to prevent states from using force as they felt so inclined", said [[Louise Doswald-Beck]], [[Secretary-General]] [[International Commission of Jurists]].&lt;ref&gt;International Commission of Jurists, 18 March 2003, "Iraq - ICJ Deplores Moves Toward a War of Aggression on Iraq" {{cite web |url=http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&amp;lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407232423/http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 April 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some commentators interpret Article 2(4) as banning only the use of force directed at the territorial integrity or political independence of a state, the more widely held opinion is that these are merely intensifiers, and that the article constitutes a general prohibition, subject only to the exceptions stated in the Charter (self-defence and Chapter VII action by the [[Security Council]]). The latter interpretation is also supported by the historic context in which the Charter was drafted, the preamble specifically states that "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" is a principal aim of the UN as such. This principle is now considered to be a part of [[customary international law]], and has the effect of banning the use of armed force except for two situations authorized by the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Case ''Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Jurisdiction of the Court and Admissibility of the Application)'' [1984] ICJ Rep 392 [http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/?sum=367&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=70&amp;p3=5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210929/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/?sum=367&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=70&amp;p3=5 |date=1 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize [[collective action]] to maintain or enforce international peace and security.  Secondly, Article 51 also states that: "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a state."  There are also more controversial claims by some states of a right of [[humanitarian intervention]], reprisals and the protection of nationals abroad.

==The meaning of "force"==

Article 2(4) does not use the term "[[war]]" but rather refers to "the threat or use of force." Although clearly encompassed by the article, it is ambiguous whether the article only refers to [[military force]] or economic, political, ideological or psychological force. The Preamble to the Charter declares that the "armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest..." Article 51 preserves the "right of individual or collective self defence if an ''armed attack'' occurs...". In 1970 the General Assembly adopted the ''[http://www.gibnet.com/library/un2625.htm Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations]''. This resolution was adopted without vote by consensus but is considered an authoritative statement on the interpretation of certain provisions of the Charter. The Declaration reiterates article 2(4) and elaborates upon the occasions when the threat or use of force is prohibited but it does not address the question of whether force includes non-military force within the scope of the Charter. The Declaration also states that: "Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall be the construed as enlarging or diminishing in any way the scope of the provisions of the Charter concerning cases in which the use of force is lawful." Certain types of armed and non-armed intervention are prohibited by the Declaration: "No State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law." The Declaration addresses the use of non-military force in the context of other international obligations such as the obligation not to intervene in the affairs of another state.

A number of developing nations have maintained that "force" includes non-military force but the developed states have resisted this view while conceding that non-military force of various kinds may be outlawed by other principles of international law.

==Collective action==

The Security Council is authorized to determine the existence of, and take action to address, any threat to international peace and security.  In practice this power has been relatively little-used because of the presence of five veto-wielding permanent members with interests in a given issue.  Typically measures short of armed force are taken before armed force, such as the imposition of sanctions.  The first time the Security Council authorized the use of force was in 1950 to secure a [[North Korea]]n withdrawal from [[South Korea]].  Although it was originally envisaged by the framers of the UN Charter that the UN would have its own designated forces to use for enforcement, the intervention was effectively controlled by forces under [[United States]] command.  The weaknesses of the system are also notable in that the fact that the resolution was only passed because of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] boycott and the occupation of [[China]]'s seat by the [[Nationalist Chinese]] of [[Taiwan]].

The Security Council did not authorize the use of significant armed force again until the invasion of [[Kuwait]] by [[Iraq]] in 1990.  After passing resolutions demanding a withdrawal, the Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Resolution 678]], which authorized the use of force and requested all member states to provide the necessary support to a force operating in cooperation with Kuwait to ensure the withdrawal of Iraqi forces.  This resolution was never revoked.

On 8 November 2002, the Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|Resolution 1441]], by a unanimous 15–0 vote: Russia, China, France, and Arab states such as Syria voted in favor. It has been argued that 1441 impliedly authorized UN member states to wage war against Iraq without any further decision by the UN Security Council. The representatives in the meeting were clear that this was not the case. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte, said:
"	[T]his resolution contains no "hidden triggers" and no "automaticity" with respect to the use of force. If there is a further Iraqi breach, reported to the Council by UNMOVIC, the IAEA or a Member State, the matter will return to the Council for discussions as required in paragraph 12. The resolution makes clear that any Iraqi failure to comply is unacceptable and that Iraq must be disarmed. And, one way or another, Iraq will be disarmed. If the Security Council fails to act decisively in the event of further Iraqi violations, this resolution does not constrain any Member State from acting to defend itself against the threat posed by Iraq or to enforce relevant United Nations resolutions and protect world peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=S/PV.4644 |body=S |type=V |meeting=4644 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk01 |date=8 November 2002 |meetingtime=10:00 |speakername=[[John Negroponte]] | speakernation=United States |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;	"
The ambassador for the United Kingdom, the co-sponsor of the resolution, said:
"	We heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concerns about "automaticity" and "hidden triggers" – the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response... There is no "automaticity" in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the Council for discussion as required in paragraph 12. We would expect the Security Council then to meet its responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=S/PV.4644 |body=S|type = V |meeting=4644 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk01 |date=8 November 2002 |meetingtime=10:00|speakername= [[Sir Jeremy Greenstock]]|speakernation=United Kingdom |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"
The message was further confirmed by the ambassador for Syria:
"	Syria voted in favour of the resolution, having received reassurances from its sponsors, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and from France and Russia through high-level contacts, that it would not be used as a pretext for striking against Iraq and does not constitute a basis for any automatic strikes against Iraq. The resolution should not be interpreted, through certain paragraphs, as authorizing any State to use force. It reaffirms the central role of the Security Council in addressing all phases of the Iraqi issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=S/PV.4644 |body=S |type=V |meeting=4644 |date=8 November 2002 |time=10:00 |speakername= [[Faisal Mekdad]]|speakernation=Syria|accessdate=7 July 2015 |anchor=pg010-bk01 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN has also authorized the use of force in [[peacekeeping]] or humanitarian interventions, notably in the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Somalia]], and [[Sierra Leone]].

==Self-defense==
{{Main article|Self-defence in international law}}
Article 51:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.  Measures taken by members in exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus there is a right of self-defence under customary international law, as the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) affirmed in the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua Case]]'' on the use of force.  Some commentators believe that the effect of Article 51 is only to preserve this right when an armed attack occurs, and that other acts of self-defence are banned by article 2(4).  The more widely held opinion is that article 51 acknowledges this general right, and proceeds to lay down procedures for the specific situation when an armed attack does occur.  Under the latter interpretation, the legitimate use of self-defence in situations when an armed attack has not actually occurred is permitted.  It is also to be noted that not every act of violence will constitute an armed attack.  The ICJ has tried to clarify, in the Nicaragua case, what level of force is necessary to qualify as an armed attack.

The traditional customary rules on self-defence derive from an early diplomatic incident between the United States and the United Kingdom over the killing on some US citizens engaged in an attack on Canada, then a British colony.  The so-called ''Caroline'' case established that there had to exist "a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation,' and furthermore that any action taken must be [[Proportionality (law)|proportionate]], "since the act justified by the necessity of self-defence, must be limited by that necessity, and kept clearly within it."  These statements by the US Secretary of State to the British authorities are accepted as an accurate description of the customary right of self-defence.

===Pre-emptive force===
{{See also|Caroline test}}

There is a limited right of pre-emptive self-defence under customary law.  Its continuing permissibility under the Charter hinges on the interpretation of article 51.  If it permits self-defence only when an armed attack has occurred, then there can be no right to pre-emptive self-defence.  However, few observers really think that a state must wait for an armed attack to actually ''begin'' before taking action.  A distinction can be drawn between "preventive"  self-defence, which takes place when an attack is merely possible or foreseeable, and a permitted "interventionary" or "anticipatory" self-defence, which takes place when an armed attack is imminent and inevitable.  The right to use ''interventionary'', pre-emptive armed force in the face of an imminent attack has not been ruled out by the ICJ. But state practice and opinio juris overwhelmingly suggests that there is no right of ''preventive'' self-defence under international law.

===Protection of nationals===

The controversial claim to a right to use force in order to protect nationals abroad has been asserted by some States. Examples include intervention by the UK in Suez (1956), Israel in Entebbe (1976) and the USA in the Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). The majority of States are doubtful about the existence of such a right. It is often claimed alongside other rights and reasons for using force. For example, the USA intervention in Grenada was widely considered to be in response to the rise to power of a socialist government. The danger that this posed to US nationals was doubtful and resulted in condemnation by the General Assembly. As with the above examples (except the Entebbe incident), the protection of nationals is often used as an excuse for other political objectives.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Humanitarian intervention==
{{main article|Humanitarian intervention}}
In recent years several countries have begun to argue for the existence of a right of humanitarian intervention without Security Council authorization.  In the aftermath of the [[Kosovo]] crisis in 1999, the UK Foreign Secretary asserted that, "In international law, in exceptional circumstances and to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, military action can be taken and it is on that legal basis that military action was taken."  It is very difficult to reconcile this statement with the UN Charter.  When [[NATO]] used military force against the Yugoslav state, it did not have authorization from the Security Council, but it was not condemned either.  This is because veto-wielding countries held strong positions on both sides of the dispute.

Many countries oppose such unauthorized humanitarian interventions on the formal ground that they are simply illegal, or on the practical ground that such a right would only be ever used against weaker states by stronger states.  This was specifically shown in the Ministerial Declaration of G-77 countries, in which 134 states condemned such intervention. Proponents have typically resorted to a claim that the right has developed as a new part of customary law.

==The use of non-military force==

There has been widespread debate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shreyan|first1=Sengupta|title=Use of force by states|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:7423/eth-7423-01.pdf|website=ETH Zurich|publisher=ETH Zurich|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;about the significance of the phrasing of article 2(4), specifically about the use of the solitary word "force."  There is a strain of opinion{{According to whom|date=February 2011}} holding that whereas "armed attack" is referred to in article 51, the use of the word "force" in 2(4) holds a wider meaning, encompassing economic force or other methods of non-military coercion. Cyber-attacks, according to some frameworks such as the [[Schmitt Analysis|Schmitt analysis]], could be seen in some cases as being a use of force. Although such measures may be banned by certain other provisions of the Charter, it does not seem possible to justify such a wide non-military interpretation of 2(4) in the light of subsequent state practice.  It must also be noted{{Tone inline|date=February 2011}} that this article covers the threat of force, which is not permissible in a situation where the use of actual armed force would not be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''Walking Together''' ({{lang-ru|Идущие вместе}}, Idushchiye vmyestye) is a [[Russia]]n [[youth movement]] that was created by [[Vasily Yakemenko]] in May 2000.&lt;ref name="Schmid"&gt;[http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2006-06-12-schmidu-de.html ''"Nasi - Die Putin-Jugend"''] by Ulrich Schmid, Osteuropa, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The group, which had over 50 thousand members as of January 2002, is strongly pro-Putin and is openly endorsed by President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s administration.  It has strict rules and indoctrination methods, and is openly criticized for its similarity to the Soviet [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] established by the Communist Party in 1922.  The senior patron of the movement is [[Vladislav Surkov]], the deputy head of the [[Russian presidential administration|presidential administration]]. The group was transformed into [[Nashi (youth movement)|"Nashi" (Ours)]] youth group in 2005 after a scandal involving the dissemination of pornography.&lt;ref name="Schmid"/&gt;

==Background==
Before creating ''Walking Together'', Mr Yakimenko was the overseer of state-run charities.  The group's first action in November 2000 was to celebrate Putin's administration with a rally in front of the Kremlin.  Group organizers cite a long history of such groups in Russia.

Many liberals in Russia fear that the organization is designed to set up a cult of personality around President Putin. Some of the groups requirements include commands to read six Russian classics a year and to visit the site of a battle where Russia was victorious.  The reading of modern "liberal" works is discouraged by Walking Together.  At one rally, members were encouraged to tear apart copies of [[Vladimir Sorokin]]'s ''Blue Salo'', which was deemed pornographic for a passage depicting gay sex between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  The group brought formal charges against the author for writing pornographic literature.

==Organization==
Walking Together is sponsored by two companies with ties to the Kremlin and the Moscow city council.  Members of the group are divided into groups of five called "red stars", each led by a "foreman" who receives a free pager and 1,500 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] for his services. Each of his five "soldiers" receives 50 rubles as well as free T-shirts. The group soon acquired  the nickname the "Putinjugend" in the mass media since the activists usually wore T-shirts with a portrait of Putin.&lt;ref name="Schmid"/&gt;  Groups have criticized the organization, claiming that its rallies are only popular with young people because of the free handouts.  Members are encouraged to get others to join in a way that mirrors [[Komsomol]] indoctrination methods. Once a member has a red star, he must persuade another 50 members to join.

==Decline and transformation==
In 2004 the group fell into a crisis. A group member was involved in the illegal dissemination of pornographic video tapes, there were also financial disputes between the Petersburg section and the Moscow headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/21feb2005/kremlin.html |title=Кремль готовит новый молодежный проект на замену "Идущим вместе" |publisher=Newsru.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sorokin{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} fell out of favor with the Kremlin. Against this backdrop, the Kremlin created a new youth group call [[Nashi (Ours)]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jens |last=Siegert |title=Politische Jugendorganisationen und Jugendbewegungen in Russland |journal=Russlandanalysen |issue=83 |year=2005 |pages=2–10 |language=German |url=http://www.laender-analysen.de/russland/pdf/Russlandanalysen083.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Working Group on Financial Markets''' (also, '''President's Working Group on Financial Markets''', the '''Working Group''', and colloquially the '''Plunge Protection Team''') was created by  [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12631,&lt;ref name="EO12631"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12631.html|title=Executive Orders|author=|date=March 18, 1988|publication-date=August 15, 2016|publisher=| accessdate=August 10, 2018}}, which appears and purports to be a copy of the original:   {{cite journal |url= https://www.loc.gov/item/fr053055/ |journal=Federal Register |volume= 53 |issue=55| page= 9421 |title= Executive Order 12631 of March 18 1988: Working Group on Financial Markets  |author= National Archives And Records Administration |date=March 18, 1988|publication-date=March 22, 1988|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |id=FR Doc. 88-6380}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed on March 18, 1988, by [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].

As established by the executive order, the Working Group has three purposes and functions:

"(a) Recognizing the goals of enhancing the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of our Nation's financial markets and maintaining investor confidence, the Working Group shall identify and consider: 
:(1) the major issues raised by the numerous studies on the events in the financial markets surrounding [[Black Monday (1987)|October 19, 1987]], and any of those recommendations that have the potential to achieve the goals noted above; and 
:(2) the actions, including governmental actions under existing laws and regulations (such as policy coordination and contingency planning), that are appropriate to carry out these recommendations. 
(b) The Working Group shall consult, as appropriate, with representatives of the various exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory bodies, and with major market participants to determine private sector solutions wherever possible.&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The Working Group shall report to the President initially within 60 days (and periodically thereafter) on its progress and, if appropriate, its views on any recommended legislative changes."&lt;ref name="EO12631"/&gt;

The Working Group consists of: 
* The [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], or his or her designee (as Chairperson of the Working Group); 
* The Chairperson of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], or his or her designee; 
* The Chairperson of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], or his or her designee; and 
* The Chairperson of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], or his or her designee.

==Plunge Protection Team==
"Plunge Protection Team" was originally the headline for an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on February 23, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm | work=The Washington Post | author= | date=February 23, 1997 | title=Plunge Protection Team | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been used by some as an informal term to refer to the Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url-access=subscription |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2006/10/30/ccview30.xml|title=Monday view: Paulson re-activates secretive support team to prevent markets meltdown|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=Ambrose|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=Telegraph UK|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4258005,00.html|title=Fed to prop up Wall St|last=Wachman|first=Richard|author2=Jamie Doward Observer |date=2001-09-16|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the term was used to express the opinion that the Working Group was being used to prop up the [[stock market]]s during downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm|title=Plunge Protection Team |last=Fromson|first=Brett.

He stated that "If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players, it had to have come from somewhere else" and "Why not support the stock market as well? Moreover, several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/CharlesBiderman-Fed-government-Rigging/2010/01/06/id/345497|title=Biderman: Fed, Gov't Likely Rigging Market Rally|last=Crawshaw |first=Julie|date=2010-01-10|publisher=Money News|access-date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Sprott Asset Management released a report that argued that there is little doubt that the PPT intervened to protect the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprott.com/Docs/SpecialReports/08_2005_TheVisibleHand.pdf|title=Sprott Asset Management|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these articles usually refer to the Working Group using moral suasion to attempt to convince banks to buy stock index futures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_stock_markets_da/ Federal Government Manipulating Equities Market?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the ''Wall Street Journal'', opined that "Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole." {{Citation needed span|date=August 2018|text=His statement has been used to claim that the Fed actually did act in that way.}} Some{{who|date=May 2014}} mainstream analysts call those claims a [[conspiracy theory]], explaining that such claims are simplistic and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] wrote in his 2008 book ''Bad Money'' that while he had no interest "in becoming a conspiracy investigator", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that "some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the stock market akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises."&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Phillips | first=K. | year=2008 | title=Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism | publisher=Viking | isbn=978-0-670-01907-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips infers that the simplest way for the Working Group to intervene in market plunges would be through buying [[stock market index]] [[futures contracts]], either in cooperation with major banks or through [[trading room|trading desks]] at the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"/&gt;

On October 6, 2008, the working group issued a statement indicating that it was taking multiple actions available to it in order to attempt to stabilize the financial system, although purchase of stock shares was not part of the statement.&lt;ref name="October_statment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1177.aspx|title=Statement by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|access-date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government may wind up owning shares in the firms to which it provided loans, as they will receive warrants as collateral for these loans.
