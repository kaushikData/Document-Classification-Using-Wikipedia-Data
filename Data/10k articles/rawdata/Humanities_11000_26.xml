The '''2014 Canon Media Awards''' were hosted by the [[New Zealand]] Newspaper Publishers' Association on Friday 9 May 2014 at the Pullman Hotel in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards night|url=http://www.canonmediaawards.co.nz/about-awards/awards-night|website=Canon Media Awards|publisher=NPA|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newspaper of the Year was ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', and the Reporter of the Year was Andrea Vance of Fairfax Media's political bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Winners at the Canon Media Awards 2014|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1405/S00379/big-winners-at-the-canon-media-awards-2014.htm|website=Scoop|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, there were calls for the withdrawal of the Canon Media Award for Best Blog presented to [[Cameron Slater]] at the 2014 Canon Media Awards due to allegations of the recipient's involvement in political impropriety as published that same month in the book ''[[Dirty Politics]]''. The Newspaper Publishers' Association did not withdraw the award, and released a statement that allegations presented in ''Dirty Politics'' did not constitute sufficient evidence or proof of wrongdoing.

==Cameron Slater controversy==
In August 2014, following the publication of [[Nicky Hager]]'s book ''Dirty Politics'' which alleged Cameron Slater's involvement with political impropriety, there were calls from online media for Slater's Canon Media Award for Best Blog to be withdrawn. However, the Newspaper Publishers' Association issued a statement saying that the award would not be withdrawn. NPA editorial director Rick Neville said "The only justification for even considering this would be if concrete evidence came forward of illegal or highly unethical methods having been used to obtain the Len Brown story. Nicky Hager has made a number of allegations but these are not the same as evidence or proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10388554/Cameron-Slater-to-keep-Canon-award|title=Cameron Slater to keep Canon award|date=15 August 2014|work=Stuff|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnold Rodgers Taylor''' (1913–93) was a scholar of medieval English, Old Norse, and modern Icelandic.

==Early life==

Taylor was the youngest of the four children of Arthur Harry Taylor, from Burnham in Norfolk, and Elizabeth Rodgers, from Stockton. After graduating from high school in Stockton, Taylor read English at the University of Manchester (St. Anselm Hall), graduating in 1934. Under the influence of [[E. V. Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Taylor, 'Icelandic in the English Universities', ''Saga-Book'', 14 (1953-57), 1-11 (9).&lt;/ref&gt; he spent the spring of 1933 as an exchange student in Iceland. In 1934 he took his MA at Manchester, writing on ''[[Droplaugarsona saga]]'', and then spent a further year there gaining a teaching certificate. During these years, he continued to spend much of his time in Iceland, meeting his future wife Sigríður Ásgeirsdóttir (1911–91) there in 1935.

After holding a substitute teaching position in Ashton under Lyne in 1937, Taylor went to Germany as an assistant professor of English at the [[University of Jena]] from 1937–39, followed by a year of high-school teaching at Darlington.

==Second World War==

With the outbreak of war, Arnold volunteered his German skills to the British army, but with an even greater lack of soldiers knowing Icelandic, he was posted to Iceland in 1940. In 1941 he met Sigríður again, and they married in Reykjavík in March 1942, moving to England later that year. Arnold continued both to fight and translate in North Africa, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands until the summer of 1946, when he returned to high-school teaching in County Durham.

==University of Leeds==

In January 1947 Arnold began the career which dominated his life, gaining a lectureship in the English Department at the [[University of Leeds]], where he succeeded [[Bruce Dickins]] (who had himself succeeded Arnold's tutor E. V. Gordon when Gordon left Leeds for Manchester) in teaching medieval English, Old Norse and modern Icelandic Studies. He became a senior lecturer in 1956 and retired in 1978 (when he was succeeded by [[Rory McTurk]]). From 1952-54 he was President of [[The Viking Society for Northern Research]]. He became a Knight of the Icelandic Order of the Falcon in 1963, and in 1978 a Knight Commander of the order.

Taylor is best known for his 1957 revision of Gordon's ''[[An Introduction to Old Norse]]'', which remained the main textbook in Old Norse in the Anglophone world into the twenty-first century. He also produced an ''Icelandic-English Pocket Dictionary'' (Reykjavík: Orðabókarútgáfan, 1956) and a number of articles, though ill health hampered his writing.

==Death==

Taylor died in England 30 May 1993. In accordance with his last wishes, he was granted burial in Icelandic soil beside his wife, at Blönduós.

}}'''''After Man: A Zoology of the Future''''' is a 1981 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by several illustrators including Diz Wallis, John Butler, Brian McIntyre, Philip Hood, Roy Woodard and Gary Marsh. The book also features a foreword by [[Desmond Morris]]. ''After Man'' explores a hypothetical future set 50 million years from now, a time period Dixon dubs the "Posthomic", which is inhabited by animals that have [[Evolution|evolved]] from survivors of a [[mass extinction]] succeeding our own time.

''After Man'' used a fictional setting and hypothetical animals to explain the natural processes behind evolution, a concept that proved successful. The success of ''After Man'' spawned two following speculative evolution books (sometimes called the "''After'' trilogy"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite interview|last=Naish|first=Darren|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|access-date=2018-09-21|work=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which used new fictional settings and creatures to explain other natural processes. ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'', released in 1988, explained the concept of [[zoogeography]] and [[biogeographic realm]]s through a world in which the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never happened and [[non-avian dinosaurs]] were still alive. ''[[Man After Man]]'', released in 1990, focused on [[climate change]] over the next few million years through the eyes of future human species [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to adapt to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/30/speculative-biology-understanding-the-past-and-predicting-our-future|title=Speculative biology: understanding the past and predicting our future|last=Lydon|first=Susannah|date=2018-05-30|work=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''After Man'' and Dixon's following books inspired the speculative evolution artistic movement which focuses on speculative scenarios in the evolution of life, often possible future scenarios (such as ''After Man'') or alternative paths in the past (such as ''The New Dinosaurs''). Dixon is often considered the founder of the modern speculative evolution movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/9/17437644/after-man-new-edition-evolution-humanity-extinction-dougal-dixon-interview-speculative-biology|title=This book imagines what animals might look like if humans went extinct|last1=Potenza|first1=Alessandra|website=The Verge|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
[[File:World After Man.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the continents in ''After Man'', having experienced 50 million years of [[continental drift]] since the present day]]
''After Man'' explores Earth 50 million years in the future, hypothesizing what new animals might evolve in the timespan between its setting and the present day. Ecology and evolutionary theory are applied to create believable creatures, all of which have their own binomial names and text describing their behaviour and interactions with other contemporary animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this new period of the [[Cenozoic]], which Dixon calls the "Posthomic", [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] have [[African Plate|fused]], closing the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; whereas [[Asia]] and [[North America]] has collided and closed the [[Bering Strait]]; [[South America]] has split from [[Central America]]; [[Australia]] has collided with [[Southern Asia]] (colliding with the mainland sometime in the last 10 million years), uplifting a mountain range beyond the mountains of the [[Far East]] that has become the most extensive and the highest chain in the world, greater even than the [[Himalayas]] at their zenith 50 million years ago; and parts of eastern Africa have [[East African Rift|split off]] to form a new island called [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. Other volcanic islands have been added, such as the Pacaus [[archipelago]] and Batavia.

Over a hundred future animal species are described and illustrated in the book. Major groups include the "rabbucks", versatile descendants of rabbits filling the ecological niches of [[deer]], [[zebra]]s, [[giraffe]]s and [[antelope]], "gigantelopes", descendants of antelope filling niche held by [[African bush elephant|elephants]], [[giraffes]], [[moose]], [[musk oxen]], [[rhinoceroses]], and other large herbivores and the [[Predation|predatory]] rats, the major group of terrestrial predators and descendants of rats.

== Development ==
As a child, Dixon was inspired by [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'', particularly the far future creatures featured in the book, to create his own imaginary future animals descended from creatures of the modern day. These animals often served as background characters in Dixon's own retellings of Wells' work. In the 1960s, Dixon was influenced by the contemporary conservationist movements, especially a campaign to save the [[tiger]]s. Dixon began to ponder that should the tiger and other endangered animals go extinct, something would inevitably take their place. After seeing a "Save the Whale" badge on a friend in the late 1970s, the idea materialized again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dixon devised ''After Man'' as a popular-level book on the processes of evolution that instead of using the past to tell the story projected the processes into the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After finishing a dummy version of the book, with text and his own illustrations, Dixon took the book to two different publishers in London, both of whom immediately greenlit the project.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tetzoo.com/blog/2018/9/16/the-dougal-dixon-iafter-mani-event-of-september-2018|title=The Dougal Dixon  After Man  Event of September 2018|work=Tetrapod Zoology Podcast|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When designing the various animals of the book, Dixon looked at the different types of biomes on the planet and what adaptations animals living there have, designing new animals descended from modern day ones with the same set of adaptations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though Dixon made illustrations of his future animals to pitch the project, the final book used illustrations by other artists due to a publisher decision. Dixon created detailed illustrations that the artists followed in the creation of the final artwork featured in ''After Man''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In March 2018, Breakdown Press published a new edition of the book, updated to reflect modern science relating to evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The updated version also features new artwork for some of the animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The first review of ''After Man'' was one made by Professor Barry Cox of [[King's College London]] in a science-based radio programme. Cox's review was extremely negative, but subsequent reviews were highly positive. Reviews in ''[[New Scientist]]'' and ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' praised the book and Dixon went on [[Publicity Tour|publicity tours]] in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''After Man'' was at the time of its release portrayed in reviews as a book about the extinction of mankind, though Dixon has stated that mankind's end was simply an excuse to discuss evolution, humanity having very little do with the "plot" of the book.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1982, the book was a finalist for the [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]].&lt;ref name="Hugo82"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1982-hugo-awards/|title=1982 Hugo Awards|publisher=World Science Fiction Society|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVDaIgM?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1982-hugo-awards/|archivedate=2011-05-07|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Following the success of ''After Man'', Dixon realized that there was a market for popular-level books which use fictional examples and settings to explain actual factual scientific processes. ''After Man'' had explained the process of evolution by creating a complex hypothetical future ecosystem, the "sequel" ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988) was instead aimed at creating a book on [[zoogeography]], a subject the general public was quite unfamiliar with, by using a fictional world in which the [[non-avian dinosaurs]] had not gone extinct to explain the process. ''The New Dinosaurs'' was followed by another project in 1990, ''[[Man After Man]]'', which focused on the future evolution of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Japanese markets were highly interested in ''After Man'', and Japanese adaptations were made of the book, including both a [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] documentary and an [[Animation|animated]] film.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To date, Dixon's 2010 speculative evolution book ''Greenworld'', exploring humanity's impact on an alien ecosystem, has only been published in Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''[[The Future Is Wild|The Future is Wild]]'', a 2002 miniseries, features future animals evolving over the course of several million years. Early in its development, Dixon was brought in as a consultant. Dixon designed many of the creatures featured in the programme, some of which are similar to creatures in ''After Man'' (such as the "gannetwhale", a bird similar to the whale-like penguins of ''After Man''), and co-authored the companion book with the producer of the series, John Adams. ''The Future is Wild'' also focused considerably on future environmental changes, something Dixon avoided in ''After Man'' so that readers would at the very least recognize the background inhabited by the various future animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''The Future is Wild'' was unable to use Dixon's original creatures as [[DreamWorks SKG]] had bought and owned the rights to ''After Man''. DreamWorks eventually abandoned the project, and the rights were then bought by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], though no potential movie adaptation has yet materialized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Angharad Llwyd (4670528).jpg|thumb|Photograph of Angharad Llwyd, c.1860]]
'''Angharad Llwyd''' (15 April 1780 &amp;ndash; 16 October 1866) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Antiquarian|antiquary]] and a prizewinner at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].

She was born at [[Caerwys]] in [[Flintshire]], the daughter of Rev. [[John Lloyd (antiquary)|John Lloyd]], himself a noted antiquary. Her essay entitled ''Catalogue of Welsh Manuscripts, etc. in North Wales'' won a prize at the [[Welshpool]] eisteddfod of 1824. In 1827 she edited a revised version of Sir [[Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet|John Wynn]]'s ''History of the Gwydir Family''. In the following year, she was among those awarded silver medals by [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], on his visit to the eisteddfod at [[Denbigh]]. She won another first prize at the [[Beaumaris]] eisteddfod of 1833.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Treachery Of Images]]'' (1928-29) by [[René Magritte]] depicts a pipe along with text stating "This is not a pipe."]] --&gt;

'''Anti-genre''' is a [[self-descriptive word|self-descriptive]] label attributed to any artistic style devoid of [[genre]].  This lack of genre-status can either be the result of:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) an active attempt to evade categorization (transcend all genres), &lt;br /&gt;
(2) conscious negation of the [[ethos]] of its medium (unlearning of history),&lt;br /&gt;
(3) an active and conscious negation of itself.

The anti-genre is not simply an assault on tradition (previous artistic styles), for every anti-thesis in history would then fall under this title. (see [[Anti-genre#Hard versus Soft|Hard versus Soft]] section)  The anti-genre, rather implies a more direct and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attack on the foundations of its medium.  The anti-genre is in a perpetual state of evasion both from external [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], but also from itself.

The artistic movement known as [[Dada]] is likely the best example of the anti-genre, although the Dada manifestos of [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] never use the term 'anti-genre' to describe Dada,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
DADA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING.  Every man must shout: there is great destructive, negative work to be done. To sweep, to clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.391.org/manifestos/19180323tristantzara_dadamanifesto.htm Tzara, Tristan (1918) ''dada Manifesto.'', Paris, France]&lt;/ref&gt;
 Dada means nothing...   Thought is produced in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[etymology]] of the term anti-genre borrows its [[semantic]] form from the terms [[wikt:anti-|anti-]] meaning ''against'' and ''genre'', (French "kind," related to the English "gender")

==Examples in Music==

The best example of the anti-genre in music is [[John Cage]]'s 1952 composition [[4′33″]], in which the entire performance consists of four and a half minutes of utter silence.  The musicians are instructed not to play their instruments.  All the audience can hear is the sound of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John (1961) ''Silence: Lectures and Writings'', Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In this famous and controversial piece, John Cage presents silence as the [[antithesis]] of music.  Thus, the absence of all audible content becomes music's anti-genre.  There are, however other examples.

If [[music]] is the artistic arrangement of sound, then the non-artistic arrangement of sound might be a suitable candidate for musical-negation.  Non-music becomes noise, rather than artful melody and rhythm.  Examples of [[noise music]] range from guitar-based feedback recordings and live performances ([[The Melvins]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Jimi Hendrix]]) to the screeching sounds of [[Screamo]], [[Grindcore]], [[industrial music]] or contemporary dance electronic styles like [[Gabber]], Terrorcore, [[Breakcore]], [[Glitch (music)|Glitch]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia - [[List of hardcore genres]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the entire ethos of the [[Punk subculture]] was based on nihilism, which by its very nature seeks category annihilation.

==Examples in Literature==
[[File:Nietzsche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]].]]
The anti-genre, in literature, comes into being in particular during the mid to late 19th century.  Both [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1864 novel [[Notes from Underground]], with his introduction of the anti-hero (referred to as the Underground Man) as well as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]] published in 1895, represent early works in the tradition.

For Dostoyevsky's underground man, all the virtues of the traditional protagonist (the hero) are turned upside down.  Rather than courageous he is weak and complains of both physical pain as well as deeper (more existential) angst.  Rather than altruism and chivalry he feels vengeance and spite towards others.  Dostoyevsky's underground man introduces to western literature the [[archetype]] of the [[anti-hero]].  His early work also attacks the [[positivists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, thereby strengthening the case against [[utopian]] optimism.  The introduction of the anti-hero combined with his [[dystopian]] proposal, represent more of a soft anti-genre status rather than the more technical definition of the term.

For Nietzsche, the task of overcoming history required a grand declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Michael.  Introduction to, ''Twilight of the Idols/The Anti-Christ''.  London: Penguin Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  His enemies were many:    In the last sane year of his life he was able to complete two final texts, [[Twilight of the Idols]] and [[The Anti-Christ]].

More technical examples of the anti-genre in literature might include [[meta-fiction]] or [[aleatoricism]], but there is lack of contemporary scholarship on the topic to resolve this matter definitively.

==Paradox of the Anti-Genre==
Is the anti-genre itself a genre?

This poses a problem.  For, if it is a genre, then it does not exist but if it is not a genre then no discussion of it as a coherent entity can take place.  The anti-genre therefore suffers from an identity crisis.  Of course, nothing would make the anti-genre more happy than to deny its own existence.

By referencing a negation of itself in its own definition, ''anti-genre'' achieves a contradictory truth status (both true and false at the same time).  This happens any time that the definition of the word in question (or interpretation of the sentence in question) is a denial of its own meaning.  For example,

           The statement in this box is false.

When it is true (that it is false) it becomes a negation of itself.  It cannot be both true and false at the same time.  The anti-genre suffers from this same type of self-annihilation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

But, although this might pose a problem for a symbolic logician or software engineer, it poses no problem for the anti-artist.  The goal of the artist working in their respective anti-genre is to evade genre-classification.  Thus, the inability of their category to hold down a definition becomes an asset rather than a liability.

==Examples in Computer Science==
The most technical description of the paradox of the anti-genre can be found in computer science.  In computer programming an [[infinite loop]] is often an un-intended result ([[software bug|bug]]) of circular self-reference in the program code.

For example, the Dada artist's eternal maxim declares,&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dada had only one rule: Never follow any rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/dada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we (hypothetically) run this maxim through a [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] computer algorithm, it would cause program error.  For, if Dada does not obey this rule then Dada would be free to follow any rules (a direct refutation of this maxim), but if it obeys this maxim then there is at least one rule which it is following (a contradiction).  In the language of computer programming this is fatal (it prevents an exit condition from being met) but for the artist this might be the ultimate goal of his/her art.

==Hard versus Soft==
The technical definition of anti-genre (hard version) is not merely art that insults its predecessors.  The hard version is more active in its flight from meaning.  It is self-consciously involved in the process of not just breaking with tradition but undoing the entire framework that distinguishes the different genre categories in that medium.   Silence in place of music and the blank canvas in place of paint, are two obvious examples of this.

The soft version however, is a little harder to nail down.  The definition of a soft anti-genre might include art intentionally dispensing with conventions of its medium or violently breaking with tradition by [[subversion]], vandalism-art, irrationality, self-defeat or other strategies in a rebellious spirit.

The problem with this lighter version of anti-genre is that all artistic movements by definition represent a decisive break with the traditions that came before them.  If not, then they would merely be continuous with their predecessors.  This is known as the process of [[dialectic]]. First, a thesis is proposed.  Then the thesis is rejected by the [[anti-thesis]].  This rejection is eventually accepted by the community and a synthesis of thesis and anti-thesis come together to create the new proposal ready for rejection.  And so the cycle continues.

It is important to emphasize the hard and soft distinction however because there is a tendency in postmodernity to associate negative/rebellious attitudes in artistic movements with formal categories like anti-genre, despite the fact that the anti-genre, in its hard version, has a much more technical definition.

==The End of History==
What is the logical conclusion of an artistic movement that is essentially suicidal? (see [[Anti-genre#Paradox of the Anti-Genre|Paradox of the Anti-genre]] section)

After annihilating everything in their path, every artistic style and movement that had come before them, every political attitude and social value, the DaDa artist eventually had nothing left to consume and so retired to a life of seclusion and chess.

Likewise, and for all of his proselytizing (calling for a complete transvaluation of all human values), Nietzsche ended his life deep inside a state of mental illness.
And so it is not uncommon to hear writers lament that the only cure for history is a good psychiatrist and a lot of prescription medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">'''ArtStars*''' is a YouTube show hosted by Nadja Sayej that focuses on comedic conversations in the art world. It was founded in 2009 in Toronto with video artist Jeremy Bailey and video editor Ryan Edwards. The show has been called "a gonzo skewering of sanctified art pretense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2010/01/31/young_artists_thriving_with_online_talk_shows.html|title=Young artists thriving with online talk shows|work=The Star|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows the tradition of reporting on the art scene, similar to the [[GalleryBeat TV]] cable access TV show in New York City in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/arts/design/15kino.html|title=Paul H-O, Gallery Gadfly, Revives His Act|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2009-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been noted for making the art world more accessible.

Episodes include interviews with noteworthy artists [[John Waters]], [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], and [[Julian Schnabel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38773">'''Bilingual lexical access'''&lt;ref name="Crosslinguistic Influence"&gt;[[Crosslinguistic influence]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an area in [[psycholinguistics]] research that studies the activation or retrieval process of the [[mental lexicon]] for people who can speak two languages. Bilingual lexical access can be understood as all aspects of word processing, including all the mental activity from the perception of the word from one language until all its lexical knowledge from the target language is available.&lt;ref name="De Groot, A. M. (2011)"&gt;De Groot, A. M. (2011). Language and cognition in bilinguals and multilinguals: An introduction. New York, NY, US: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field seeks to fully understand these mental processes. Bilingual individuals have two mental lexical representations for an item or concept and are able to successfully select words from one language without significant interference from the other language. Thus, it is important to understand whether these dual representations interact or affect one another. Bilingual lexical access researchers focus on the control mechanisms bilinguals use to suppress the language not in use when in a monolingual mode and the degree to which the related representations within the language not in use are activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costa|first=Albert|author2=La Heij, Navarrete|title=The dynamics of bilingual lexical access|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=22 June 2006|volume=9|issue=2|page=137|doi=10.1017/s1366728906002495}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when a [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-[[English language|English]] bilingual is asked to name a picture of a [[dog]] in English, he or she will come up with the English word ''dog''. Bilingual lexical access is the mental process that underlies this seemingly simple task: the process that makes the connection between the "idea" dog and the word ''dog'' in the target language. While activating the English word ''dog'', the Dutch word ''hond'' (its equivalent in Dutch)'', ''is most likely also in a state of activation.

== History ==
Early research of bilingual lexical access was generated from the theories of unilingual [[lexical access]]. 
Theories derived from early unilingual research relied mainly upon generalizations without precise specification of how these specific systems of lexical access works. Due to the advancement of medical science within the last decade, the field of Psycholinguistics has evolved immensely, resulting in more detailed research and therefore, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind language production.  "Many early studies of second language acquisition focused on the morphosyntactic development of learners, and the general findings was that bound morphemes appear in the same order in the first and second language"(Bardovi-Harlig 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=Eva|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. ''Serial Search Models''&lt;ref&gt;Forster, K. I., &amp; Bednall, E. S. (1976). Terminating and exhaustive search in lexical access. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 4(1)'', 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, they will look through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, and then they will only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the ''Parallel Access Models''&lt;ref&gt;Morton, J. (1969). Interaction of information in word recognition. ''Psychological review, 76''(2), 165-178.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that multiple entries can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen.  Later, the researchers&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, J. Berko &amp; Ratner, N. Bernstein. (1998) ''Psycholinguistics, 2nd edition.'' New York: Harcourt Brace. (Published November 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.
Knowledge of unilingual access has inevitably led to the curiosity of bilingual lexical access. Early models of bilingual lexical access shared similar characteristics with these unilingual lexical access models.&lt;ref name="Thomas, M. S., &amp; Van Heuven, W. J. (2005)"&gt;Thomas, M. S., &amp; Van Heuven, W. J. (2005). Computational models of bilingual comprehension. ''Handbook of bilingualism'', 202.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the bilingual models began with focusing on whether the lexical access for bilinguals would be different from monolinguals. In addition to study the activation process in separate language, they also investigated whether the lexical activation would be processed in a parallel fashion for both languages or selectively processed for the target language. In this case, the bilingual models also studied whether the bilingual system has a single lexicon combining words from both languages or separate lexicons for words in each language. With the occurrence of widespread [[computational modeling]], researchers extended the theoretical approaches for the studies of bilingual lexical access.The computational models are now essential component for mainstream theories, for example, the models of Bilingual Interactive Activation [BIA] model,&lt;ref name = "bia"&gt;Dijkstra, T., Van Heuven, W.J.B., &amp; Grainger, J. (1998).Simulating cross-language competition with the bilingual interactive activation model. ''Psychologica Belgica,'' 38, 177-196.&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Semantic, Orthographic and Phonological Interactive Activation [SOPIA] model,&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, J. (1998). MROM-p: An interactive activation, multiple readout model of orthographic and phonological processes in visual word recognition. Localist connectionist approaches to human cognition, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bilingual interactive Model of Lexical Access [BLMOLA].&lt;ref&gt;Léwy, N., &amp; Grosjean, F. (1997).A computational model of bilingual lexical access. Manuscript in preparation.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most computational models need to specify all the vague descriptive notions used in the earlier models, they force researchers to be more clarified with their theories. Those revised models can also serve as to test the viability of the original theories by comparing the empirical results with data generated from the model.  In addition, the computational models can also help to generate new testable hypothesis and allow researchers to manipulate conditions which might not be possible in normal experimentation.&lt;ref name="Thomas, M. S., &amp; Van Heuven, W. J. (2005)"/&gt; For example, researchers can investigate and simulate the lexical access systems under various states of damage without using aphasic people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neuroscience of multilingualism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two main hypotheses==
The two most prominent theories on lexical access for bilinguals, Language Selective Access and Language Non-Selective Access, attempt to explain the process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented.&lt;ref name ="Dijksta, T. (2005)"&gt;Dijksta, T. (2005). Bilingual visual word recognition and lexical access. ''Handbook of bilingualism psycholinguistic approaches, 54,'' 179-201.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when the Dutch word ''vork'' is activated, is the English word ''pork'' also activated? If the answer is "no", it might suggest that language selection happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical access is language selective.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, J., &amp; Beauvillain, C. (1987). Language blocking and lexical access in bilinguals. ''The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 39''(2), 295-319.&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical access is language non-selective.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, J. F., &amp; Tokowicz, N. (2005). Models of bilingual representation and processing. ''Handbook of bilingualism: Psycholinguistic approaches,'' 531-553.&lt;/ref&gt; Research pertaining to lexical access has indicated that it is not achievable to completely suppress a known language.

==Language-selective access==
Language-selective access is the exclusive activation of information in the contextually appropriate language system.&lt;ref name = "De Groot, A. M. (2011)"/&gt; It implies that when a bilingual encounters a spoken or written word, the activation is restricted to the target language subsystem, which contains the input word.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

One possibility is that bilinguals initially make a decision about the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers&lt;ref&gt;Macnamara, J., &amp; Kushnir, S. L. (1971). Linguistic independence of bilinguals: The input switch. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 10''(5), 480-487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert, M. L., &amp; Obler, L. K. (1978). The Bilingual Brain: Neuropsychological and Neurolinguistic Aspects of Bilingualism. Perspectives in Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; found that bilinguals can comprehend passages composed of words entirely from only one language more quickly than passages composed of words from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the switch mechanism will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition in choosing which language information to use. The later lexical completion can also be used to explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.|author2=Jiang, N.|title=Non-selective lexical access in different-script bilinguals.|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=January 2012|volume=15|pages=173–180|doi=10.1017/S1366728911000022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibáñez|first=A.|author2=P. Macizo|author3=M. Bajo|title=Language access and language selection in professional translators.|journal=Acta Psychol|year=2010|issue=135|pages=257–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guzzardo Tamargo|first=R.E.|title=Linking Comprehension Costs to Production Patterns During the Processing of Mixed Language.|journal=University Park: The Pennsylvania University|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gullifer|first=J. W.|author2=J.F. Kroll|author3=P.E. Dussias|title=When Language Switching has No Apparent Cost: Lexical Access in Sentence Context|journal=Front Psychol|date=2013-05-30|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies that investigate whether lexical candidates from different languages are activated selectively or non-selectively during bilingual lexical access, there are two basic types of stimuli used: interlingual [[homographs]] and [[cognates]]. Interlingual homographs are words from two languages that are identical in their [[orthography]], but different in their meaning, or [[phonology]].  For example, the English word ''room'' means ''cream'' in Dutch. Cognates are words from two languages which are identical (or very similar) in orthography and also have large overlap in their meaning. For example, the word ''film'' is cognate for English and Dutch. Researchers used those types of stimuli to investigate whether bilinguals process them in the same way as the matched control words which occur only in one language. If the reaction time (RT) of interlexical homographs is same as the controlled monolingual word, then it supports the language-selective access hypothesis. If RT is significantly different for interlexical homographs than for the controlled monolingual word, it supports the language-nonselective access hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=T. |author2=Van Jaarsveld, H. |author3=Ten Brinke, S.|title=Interlingual homograph recognition: effects of task demands and language intermixing.|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=April 1998|volume=1|issue=1|pages=51–66|doi=10.1017/s1366728998000121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most early studies, researchers did not find clear RT differences between test items (interlexical homographs or cognates) and control items.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvillain, C. (1992). Orthographic and lexical constraints in bilingual word recognition. ''Cognitive processing in bilinguals, 83'', 221.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Gerard and Scarborough’s&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gerard, L. D., &amp; Scarborough, D. L. (1989). Language-specific lexical access of homographs by bilinguals. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15''(2), 305.&lt;/ref&gt; word recognition research with English monolinguals and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-English bilinguals, cognates, homograph non-cognates and nonhomographic control words were used.  The cognates and control words were either high frequency or low frequency in both English and Spanish. The homographic non-cognates were high frequency in English and low frequency in Spanish or vice versa. The results generally supported the language-selective hypothesis.  Even though there was a significant main effect of word type for the bilingual group, it was mainly caused by the slow response to homographic noncognates which were of low frequency in the target language but of high frequency in the non-target language. Finally, there was no significant difference in the reaction time between bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggested that the lexical access for bilinguals in this research was restricted to only one language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Language-nonselective access==
Language-nonselective access is the automatic co-activation of information in both linguistic systems.&lt;ref name = "De Groot, A. M. (2011)"/&gt; It implies that when a bilingual encounters a spoken or written word, the activation happens in both contextually appropriate and inappropriate linguistic subsystems. Also, there is evidence that bilinguals take longer than monolinguals to detect non-words while in both bilingual and monolingual modes, providing evidence that bilinguals do not fully inactivate their other language while in a monolingual mode.&lt;ref name="Soares, C., Grosjean, F. (1984)."&gt;Soares, C. and Grosjean, F. (1984). Bilinguals in a monolingual and a bilingual speech mode: The effect on lexical access. Memory and Cognition, 12(4), 380-386.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the observed null results which support the language-selective access, a sizable number of studies suggests that language-nonselective access, in which the representation of a word to a bilingual often gives rise to parallel activation in both languages, indeed takes place and it highly unlikely to completely suppress the other language.  For example, Dijkstra, van Jaarsveld &amp; Ten Brinke&lt;ref name = "Dijkstra, T., Van Jaarsveld, H., &amp; Brinke, S. T. (1998)."&gt;Dijkstra, T., Van Jaarsveld, H., &amp; Brinke, S. T. (1998). Interlingual homograph recognition: Effects of task demands and language intermixing. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 1''(01), 51-66.&lt;/ref&gt; used an English [[lexical decision task]] for Dutch-English bilinguals on a list of cognate, homographs and English controlled words. Even though they did not find a significant difference in reaction time between interlingual homographs and English control words, they found that there was a significant facilitation effect of the cognates, which could be supportive evidence for the assumption of language-nonselective access. Later, De Moor&lt;ref name ="Dijksta, T. (2005)"/&gt; repeated the English lexical decision study by Dijkstra et al.&lt;ref name = "Dijkstra, T., Van Jaarsveld, H., &amp; Brinke, S. T. (1998)."/&gt; and found that the Dutch meaning of the interlingual homographs was also activated by English-Dutch bilinguals.  Following each homographic trial, she used English trials which were the translation of the Dutch meaning of the previous homographs. For example, after the trial homographic word brand, the English word fire would be presented, which was the English translations of Dutch word brand. De Moor found there was a small but significant translation priming effect for the following English translation trials.It suggested that the lexical information of the Dutch word form was also activated, even though it did not affect the reaction time of the previous homographic trial.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

To provide clarity, cross-linguistic influence can be understood as the various ways that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons linguistic performance or development.&lt;ref name="Crosslinguistic Influence"/&gt; Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger&lt;ref&gt;Beauvillain, C., &amp; Grainger, J. (1987). Accessing interlexical homographs: Some limitations of a language-selective access. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 26''(6), 658-672.&lt;/ref&gt; had [[French language|French]]-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sáchez-Casas, R. M., García-Albea, J. E., &amp; Davis, C. W. (1992). Bilingual lexical processing: Exploring the cognate/non-cognate distinction. ''European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 4''(4), 293-310.&lt;/ref&gt; used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==In language comprehension==
Once bilinguals acquire the lexical information from both languages, the bilingual lexical access will be activated in language comprehension. The lexical access in comprehension is the process how people make contact with lexical representation in their mental lexicon that contains the information, which enables them to understand the words or sentences. Word recognition would be no doubt the most essential process of bilingual lexical access in language comprehension, in which researchers investigate the selective or non-selective recognition of isolated words. At the same time, [[sentence processing]] also plays an important role in language comprehension, in which researchers can investigate whether the presentation of words in a sentence context would restrict lexical access to the target language only.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, E., Drieghe, D., Duyck, W., Welvaert, M., &amp; Hartsuiker, R. J. (2011). The influence of semantic constraints on bilingual word recognition during sentence reading. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 64''(1), 88-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In word recognition==
[[Word recognition]]&lt;ref name = "De Groot, A. M. (2011)"/&gt; is usually used in both narrow and broad ways. When it is used in the narrow sense, it means the moment when a match occurs between a printed word and its orthographic word-form stored in the lexicon, or a match between a spoken word and its phonological word-form. Only after this match has taken place, all the syntactical and morphological information of the word and the meaning of the word will become accessible for further processing. In a broader way, it refers to lexical access is the entire period from the match processing to the retrieval of lexical information.  In the research of bilingual lexical access, word recognition uses single, out-of-context words from both languages to investigate all the aspects of bilingual lexical access.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Main methodological tasks in word recognition===
In word recognition studies, the cognate or interlingual homograph effects are most often used with following task:
# '''Word naming task:''' During a word naming task, a participant is presented with a drawing or object and is asked to name the drawing or the object. Usually during a naming task, response latencies (the time it takes to make a response) are recorded for each word. Sometimes response accuracies are recorded as well. An example of this word naming task is the Boston Naming Test, which has been used on various studies that examine the bilingual lexical access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=E.|title=Boston Naming Test|year=1983|publisher=Lee &amp; Febiger|location=Philadelphia|author2=Weintraub, S. |author3=Goodglass, H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Lexical decision task]]: '''The participants are presented with written letter sequences and asked to decide for each of them whether it is a word or not. Again, response times and/or accuracy are registered. Usually, the nonword stimuli are pseudowords, which are letter strings that obey the orthography and/or phonology of the test language but lack of meaning. There are two versions of decision task which are developed specially to study bilingual lexical access in word recognition: generalized lexical decision and language-specific lexical decision. In generalized lexical decision task, the lexical decision is made for both languages. The "yes" response is required if the presented letter sequence is a word in either language. In language-specific lexical decision task, the "yes" response must be only given to the words from the target language.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
# '''Word [[priming (psychology)|priming]] task:''' The participants are presented with a prime word before they respond to each target word.  The prime words are either lexically related or unrelated with the target words, and the effect of the prime on target word processing will be measured. A target word that follows a related prime tends to have a faster response latency than a target word preceded by an unrelated prime.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Models of bilingual lexical access in word recognition===
Most current models in word recognition take the assumption that bilingual lexical access is nonselective, which also take into account the demands of task and context dependence of processing.&lt;ref name ="Dijksta, T. (2005)"/&gt;[[File:BIAfig.JPG|thumb|350px|alt=A flow chart representation of the BIA+ model for bilingual language processing including the word identification and task/decision subsystems.|A flow chart representation of the BIA+ model for bilingual language processing including the word identification and task/decision subsystems.]]

====Bilingual interactive activation (BIA) model====
The BIA model is an implemented connectionist model of bilingual visual word recognition.&lt;ref name = "bia"/&gt; This language-nonselective model is structured by four hierarchical levels of different linguistic representations: letter features, letters, words, and language tags (or language node). When a word is presented by this model, the features of its constituted letters are firstly activated. Then, these letter features work together and activate the letters of which they are part in the presented words.  In turn, these letters activate the words of that language. The word candidates activate the language nodes which are connected. They simultaneously send feedback activation to the letter level. Language nodes can also inhibit the activation of word candidates from other languages (e.g., the English language node reduces the activation of Dutch word candidates). After a complex interactive process of activation and inhibition, the lexical candidate corresponding to the presented word becomes the most active word unit.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Inhibitory control model (IC)====
The IC model&lt;ref&gt;Green, D. W. (1986). Control, activation, and resource: A framework and a model for the control of speech in bilinguals. ''Brain and language, 27''(2), 210-223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, D. W. (1998). Mental control of the bilingual lexico-semantic system. ''Bilingualism: Language and cognition, 1''(02), 67-81.&lt;/ref&gt; is developed at large extent compatible with and complementary to the BIA model. This inhibitory control model focuses on the importance of task demands and regulation happened during language processing by modifying the levels of activation of items in language network. In this model, a key concept is the language task schema, which specifies the mental processing steps that bilinguals take to perform a particular language task. The language task schema regulates the output from the word identification system by altering the activation levels of representations within that system and by inhibiting outputs from the system. For example, when a bilingual switches from one language to another in translation, a change in the language schema corresponding to must take place.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Language mode framework====
In the language mode framework,&lt;ref&gt;Grosjean, F. (1997). The bilingual individual. ''Interpreting'', 2, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grosjean, F. (2001). The bilingual's language modes. ''One mind, two languages: Bilingual language processing'', 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; language processing mechanisms and languages as a whole can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they are talking to other bilinguals or reading text with mixed languages. However, if they listen to someone who is monolingual or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more monolingual mode. Based on this model, the bilinguals' language mode depends on the language users' expectation and by language environment.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Bilingual interactive activation plus (BIA+) model====
{{Main|Bilingual interactive activation plus}}
The BIA+ model is an extension and adaptation of the BIA model.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heuven, W. J., Dijkstra, T., &amp; Grainger, J. (1998). Orthographic neighborhood effects in bilingual word recognition. Journal of ''Memory and Language, 39''(3), 458-483.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, A. F. J., &amp; Heuven, W. V. (2002). The architecture of the bilingual word recognition system: From identification to decision. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 5'', 175-197.&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA+ model includes not only orthographic representation and language nodes, but also phonological and semantic representations. All these representations are assumed to be part of a word identification system that provides output to a task/decision system. The information flow in bilingual lexical processing proceeds exclusively from the word identification system toward a task/decision system without any influence of this task/decision system on the activation state of words.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==In sentence processing==
Most current studies of bilingual lexical access are based on the comprehension of isolated words without considering whether contextual information affects lexical access in bilinguals. However, in everyday communication, words are most often encountered in a meaningful context and not in isolation (e.g. in a newspaper article). Research done by Déprez (1994) has shown that mixed utterances in children are not limited to the lexical level but also in the areas of morphology, syntax, and pronunciation. Researchers also began to investigate the cognitive nature of bilingual lexical access in context by examining word recognition in sentences.&lt;ref name = "Schwartz, A. I., &amp; Kroll, J. F. (2006)."&gt;Schwartz, A. I., &amp; Kroll, J. F. (2006). Bilingual lexical activation in sentence context. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 55''(2), 197-212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Van Hell, J. G., &amp; De Groot, A. M. (2008)"&gt;Van Hell, J. G., &amp; De Groot, A. M. (2008). Sentence context modulates visual word recognition and translation in bilinguals. ''Acta psychologica, 128''(3), 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The main methodological tasks in sentence processing===
In sentence processing, a number of on-line measuring techniques are exploited to detect the cognitive activity at the very moment it takes place or only slightly after. The cognate or interlingual homograph words are often used as a marker inserted in test sentences with following tasks:

#'''Self-paced reading:''' The participants are faced with a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
#'''[[Rapid serial visual presentation]]:'''The participants are presented with the successive segments/words one by one at a fixed rate in the same location on the screen. In this task, the participants cannot control the speed of reading, while the experimenter determines the presentation speed. The participants are required to read the words aloud and their reaction time of each segment is registered. Again, a follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences.A pictured object can be readily detected in a rapid serial visual presentation sequence when the target is specified by a superordinate category name such as animal or vehicle.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
#'''[[Eye tracking]] (or eye-movement recording):''' A more natural and more sensitive on-line technique, which records the participants’ eye movements and eye fixations while they read a text presented on a computer screen. It documents what the participants are looking at and also how long it takes for them. Experimental eye tracking data is obtained to investigate topics such as understanding of spoken language,cognitive processes related to spoken language, body language and lip reading, and etc.&lt;ref name="Psycholinguistics and eye tracking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Psycholinguistics and eye tracking|url=http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/research/linguistics/|publisher=Tobii ecgnology|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{&lt;ref name="Psycholinguistics and eye tracking"/&gt;}}

===Studies of bilingual lexical access in sentence processing===
The question whether the presentation of words in a sentence context restricts lexical access to words of the target language only are most studied in bilinguals' [[second language]] (L2) processing. This sentence context effect might be an efficient strategy to speed up lexical search, because it reduces the number of lexical candidates. For example, Elston-Guttler et al.&lt;ref&gt;Elston-Güttler, K. E., Gunter, T. C., &amp; Kotz, S. A. (2005). Zooming into L2: Global language context and adjustment affect processing of interlingual homographs in sentences. ''Cognitive Brain Research, 25''(1), 57-70.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cross-lingual activation is very sensitive to the influence of a sentence context and previous activation state of the two languages in a semantic priming study. In their study, [[German language|German]]-English bilinguals were presented with relatively low-constraint sentences in which a homograph (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty GIFT; ''gift'' means poison in ''German'') or a control word was presented at the end (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty SHELL). "Constraint" means the degree to which the sentence frame preceding the target word biased that word. The sentence was then replaced by a target word (poison) for lexical decision task. They found that only for participants who saw a German film prior to experiment and only in the first block of the experiment, participants could recognize the target faster after primed with the related homograph sentence than primed with the controlled sentence. This suggests that bilinguals can quickly "zoom into" the L2 processing situation even the L1 activation was boosted.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Later, Schwartz and Kroll&lt;ref name = "Schwartz, A. I., &amp; Kroll, J. F. (2006)."/&gt; used cognate and homograph as target words presented in low- and high-constraint sentences to Spanish-English bilinguals. They investigated how word presentation and the semantic constraint modulated language lexical access in bilinguals. Schwartz and Kroll used rapid serial visual presentation and the target word had to be named. No homograph effects were found, but less proficient bilinguals made more naming errors, especially in low-constraint sentences. They observed cognate facilitation (nonselective bilingual lexical access) in low-constraint sentences, but not in high-constraint ones. The results suggest that the semantic constraint of a sentence may restrict cross-lingual activation effects. Similar results on cognate effects were obtained by van Hell and de Groot&lt;ref name = "Van Hell, J. G., &amp; De Groot, A. M. (2008)"/&gt; in their study of Dutch-English bilinguals in an L2 lexical decision task and a translation task in forward (from L1 to L2) and in backward direction (from L2 to L1). Libben and Titone&lt;ref&gt;Libben, M. R., &amp; Titone, D. A. (2009). Bilingual lexical access in context: Evidence from eye movements during reading. ''Journal of experimental psychology. Learning, memory, and cognition, 35''(2), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; used eye tracking methodology and found that the cognate facilitation in semantically constraint sentences only happened at early stages of comprehension and rapidly resolved at later stages of comprehension.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Although the majority of studies on bilingual sentence processing are focused on L2 processing, there are still a few studies that have investigated cross-language activation during their [[native language]] (L1) reading. For example, van Assche et al.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, E., Duyck, W., Hartsuiker, R. J., &amp; Diependaele, K. (2009). Does bilingualism change native-language reading? Cognate effects in a sentence context. ''Psychological Science, 20''(8), 923-927.&lt;/ref&gt; replicated the cognate effect in L1 with Dutch-English bilinguals, and found that a non-dominant language may affect native-language sentence reading, both at earliest and at later reading stages. Titone et al.&lt;ref&gt;Titone, D., Libben, M., Mercier, J., Whitford, V., &amp; Pivneva, I. (2011). Bilingual lexical access during L1 sentence reading: the effects of L2 knowledge, semantic constraint, and L1-L2 intermixing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology-Learning Memory and Cognition, 37''(6), 1412.&lt;/ref&gt; observed this cross-language activation in English-French bilinguals at early reading stages only when the L2 was acquired early in life. They also concluded that the semantic constraint provided by a sentence can attenuate cross-language activation at later reading stages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">'''Clarence Martin Wilbur''' (1907–1997) was the [[George Sansom]] Professor of Chinese History at [[Columbia University]] from 1947 to 1976.

==Biography==
Born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Wilbur went at an early age with his parents to China, where they worked with the [[YMCA]]. He returned to Ohio for college, graduating from [[Oberlin College]] in 1931. His first job after receiving his PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1941 was with the [[Field Museum]], in Chicago, where he prepared for publication a study of plant migration left by [[Berthold Laufer]] after his death and developed a monograph on slavery in the [[Han Dynasty]].

After moving to Columbia University in 1947, he was instrumental in turning the graduate program into one of the nation's leading programs and supervised many influential graduate students. His focus of research was [[Republican China]], especially the career of [[Sun Yatsen]] and the rise of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]]. He was also a central figure in organizing the [[Columbia Oral History Project]]. Upon his retirement in 1976, his students presented him with ''Perspectives on a Changing China: Essays in Honor of Professor C. Martin Wilbur on the Occasion of His Retirement'' ed. by [[Joshua A. Fogel]] and William Rowe, Westview Press (1979) {{ISBN|0-89158-091-3}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/20/world/c-martin-wilbur-89-a-scholar-of-nationalists-rise-in-china.html | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Pace | title=C.

'''Capital City Distribution''' was a [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based [[comic book]] [[direct market|distributor]] which operated from 1980 to 1996 when they were acquired by rival [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. Under the name '''Capital Comics''', they also published comics from 1981 to 1984.

During most of its years of operation, Capital City introduced many supply chain innovations and controlled much of the American [[Midwest]]'s comics distribution market. More so than their rivals Diamond and [[Heroes World Distribution]], Capital City supported independent publishers as much as big mainstream companies like [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Heidi. [http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-unbeleivable-world-of-80s-comics-sales/ "The unbelievable world of 80s comics sales,"] ''The Beat'' (12/01/2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Capital City also published over 400 pages of printed material a month, including ''Internal Correspondence'', which provided sales figures to their clients; and ''Advance Comics'',&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt; their monthly catalog showcasing upcoming comic books, toys, and other pop-culture related items it distributed to comic book specialty shops.

== Distributor ==

=== Origins ===
In the 1970s, [[Milton Griepp]] and John Davis were running a small Madison-based distributor called [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]] (WIND). Forced to sell their assets to [[Big Rapids Distribution]], Griepp and Davis later turned the tables in 1980 when they took over much of Big Rapids' bankrupt business to form Capital City.&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;Booker, M. Keith, editor. ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'' (ABC-CLIO, 2014), p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Capital City's first acts was to utilize the personnel of another former Big Rapids' acquisition, [[Well News Co.]] of Columbus, Ohio, to become the nucleus of an early distribution branch. In 1982, Capital City acquired the Berkeley, California-based [[Common Ground Distributors]], which had been started by [[Robert Beerbohm]] in the late 1970s (and had been initially supplied by Big Rapids).

Capital City's Wisconsin location was relatively near [[World Color Press]]'s main printing plant in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. (During that period World Color printed most American comic books, including those of the two industry giants [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].)&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Carlson, KC. [http://westfieldcomics.com/blog/interviews-and-columns/kc-column-scaling-mount-baron/ "KC Column: Scaling Mount Baron,"] Westfield Comics (Nov. 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, Capital City operated out of a large warehouse in Madison that they shared with their largest account, [[mail-order]] retailer [[Westfield Comics]].&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker /&gt;

=== 1984 expansion and rise to prominence ===
Griepp became Capital City's CEO in 1984.&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt; That same year, with the demise of one of the larger independent publisher/distributors, [[Pacific Comics]], Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by Capital City and rival distributor [[Bud Plant Inc.]] Capital City also opened an expanded facility in [[Sparta, Illinois]], in the old space of another defunct rival, [[Sea Gate Distributors]], alongside the comic-book printing plant.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

By 1988, Capital City and its main surviving rival [[Diamond Comics Distributors]] had control of at least 70% of the comics distribution market between them.

In 1994, Capital created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Capital Announces Controversial Penalty Fees for Publishers: Move Follows Industry-wide Push for 30-day Returnability," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), pp. 17–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, Capital City's Canadian affiliate, STV, had warehouses in Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City; and Capital City had another freight forwarder operating out of Seattle, Washington.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Acquisition by Diamond ===
1995 saw a major restructuring of the direct market distribution system, caused by [[Marvel Comics]]'s late-1994 purchase of third-ranked distributor [[Heroes World Distribution]] and decision to distribute its titles in-house.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Marvelutionary War Declared: Unprecedented Upheaval in Direct Market," ''The Comics Journal'' #175 (March 1995), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the loss of one-third of its business (Marvel's market share) Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rival [[DC Comics]]; and despite intense efforts on the part of Davis and Griepp,&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg131.html "Tales From the Database: Diamond Ended Up With 50% of the Comics Market,"] Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark Horse Comics]] and [[Image Comics]] as well.

Capital City reacted by suing Marvel for the loss of their business, resulting in a settlement allowing them to continue distributing Marvel product until October 1995&lt;ref&gt;"Marvel goes exclusive, Capital sues Marvel, Marvel settles with Capital, Marvel buys Skybox, DC/Diamond announcement expected," ''The Comics Journal'' #175 (March 1995), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; (for everyone else, Marvel went exclusive with Heroes World starting in July).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1995.html "1995 Comic Book Sales Figures: Comics Preordered by North American Comics Shops as Reported by Capital City Distribution and Diamond Comic Distributors"], The Comics Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Capital City was able to sign exclusive deals with [[Kitchen Sink Press]], [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], and [[Viz Comics]]—as well as acquiring the Gary, Indiana-based distributor [[Friendly Frank's]].&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Capital City Acquires Friendly Frank's," ''The Comics Journal'' #178 (July 1995), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by 1996 Capital faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out.

In July 1996 Capital City was acquired by Diamond. At the time of sale, Capital had over $150 million in annual sales.&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;[http://icv2.com/about/ "Who We Are: Milton Griepp," ICv2.com.] Accessed October 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectively awarded Diamond complete control of the comics distribution system.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"/&gt; Most of Capital City's 100 employees in Madison and another 100 in Sparta lost their jobs in the deal,&lt;ref&gt;Daykin, Tom. "Comic book distributor to fold: Battered by competitive forces, Capital City Distribution sells assets," ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' (July 27, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; though a few key staff members, including co-founder John Davis, joined Diamond's staff.&lt;ref&gt;"Davis and Former Capital City Employees Join Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (Dec. 1996), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling Capital, Griepp became an industry consultant, and since early 2001, has operated [[ICv2]] ("''Internal Correspondence'' vol. 2"), an online trade magazine covering "[[geek culture]]."&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;

== Publisher ==
In 1981, Capital City decided to enter the comic book publishing field as well. Under the name '''Capital Comics''', they launched a black-and-white comics title, ''[[Nexus (comics)|Nexus]]'', a futuristic superhero series by [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], and distributed it through their own system.&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;Sanford, Jay Allen. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]," ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Bruning]] was a key part of Capital Comics' staff, acting as Editor-In-Chief and Art Director until the company ceased operation in 1984. Besides ''Nexus'', the other titles published by Capital were ''[[Badger (comics)|Badger]]'' and ''[[Whisper (comics)|Whisper]]''. In 1984, after publishing only a handful of issues of their three titles, Capital shut down its publishing operation.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital Comics Suspends Operations," ''The Comics Journal'' #89 (May 1984), pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Its titles were taken over by the new independent publisher [[First Comics]].

=== Titles published ===
* ''Nexus'': two series, 1981 and 1983, nine issues
* ''Badger'': 1983, four issues
* ''Whisper'': 1983, two issues

'''''Chasing Mummies: The Amazing Adventures of Zahi Hawass''''' &lt;!--do not replace with "was"--&gt;is&lt;!--per [[WP:MOSTV]] and [[MOS:TENSE]]--&gt; a [[reality television]] series that aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the United States. Produced by Boutique TV, the series depicted the adventures of archaeologist and [[Egyptologist]] [[Zahi Hawass|Dr. Zahi Hawass]] and his discoveries in [[Egypt]] as he is followed by young archeological fellows and a camera crew.  Due to the comedic nature of many of the interactions depicted, it is not hard to speculate that Dr. Hawass, the producer, and cast are filming what turns out to be a running inside joke between themselves.&lt;ref name='Times'&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/arts/television/14mummies.html Television Review: 'Chasing Mummies' - The Pharaoh of Egyptian Antiquities], [[Neil Genzlinger]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 July 2010 (retrieved 29 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The series ran Wednesdays on the History Channel from July 14, 2010 until its end on September 15, 2010.

==Reception==

''Chasing Mummies'' has been largely panned by critics, who write that Hawass is unlikeable and that the show is not an authentic documentary series.&lt;ref name="O'Leary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alibi.com/index.php?story=33063&amp;scn=film|title=Idiot Box: "Chasing Mummies" on History Channel brings up questions of how we define reality|last=O'Leary|first=Devin D.|date=22–28 July 2010|work=Alibi.com|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TVGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvgeekarmy.com/post/viewPost/chasing_mummies_stuck_a_sarcophagus_reality/05cb852d9dd4f75d88f17b82f0fa14f1|title=Chasing Mummies, "Stuck": a sarcophagus reality | publisher= TV Geek Army|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the show, New York Times columnist Neil Genzlinger writes, "[O]ne hopes that this show will, like some of those ancient pharaohs, die young, or that Dr. Hawass will unearth some ancient Egyptian chill pills and swallow a generous helping." He said that a segment showing an intern locked in a pyramid did not seem genuine, and that the show is "intent on forcing drama into the proceedings in a way that seems artificial."&lt;ref name='Times'/&gt;

TVGA describes the show as "a reality series in the tradition of Bravo's ''[[Flipping Out]]''. Like egomaniacal but essentially harmless blowhard Jeff Lewis, Zahi Hawass...is set up to be the comically abusive centerpiece of the show." Referring to an "intern" on the show, TVGA said, "If Zoe's not an actress and this show [is] not severely engineered / scripted, I'd both be surprised and deeply curious about how the hell ''Chasing Mummies'' could look this level of manipulated and artificial."&lt;ref name="TVGA"/&gt; The Egyptian daily ''[[Almasry Alyoum]]'' called that incident a "rather obvious bit of staged drama," and said that Hawass "is shown berating underlings in both English and Arabic, talking about himself in the third person and generally acting like a bit of a cartoon." The newspaper said ''Chasing Mummies'' "often verges on self-parody." &lt;ref name="Khalil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/pharoah-goes-war|title="The Pharoah" goes to war|last=Khalil|first=Ashraf|date=27 August 2010|work=Almasry Alyoum|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary    = The series introduces Zahi Hawass as he is supervising the restoration of Egypt's oldest pyramid, the [[Pyramid of Djoser|Step Pyramid]]. During this time, the audience is also introduced to his three young archeological [[fellow]]s, Lindsay, Derek, and Zoe. During his book signing later in the evening, Hawass receives a phone call from Leslie, the show's producer, stating that Zoe and one of the camera men had been accidentally locked inside the Step Pyramid. Hawass and the rest of the crew race back to the Step Pyramid to save them from potential death. Later, Hawass's workers discover a series of burial tombs underneath a city slum, and make a rare discovery, a sarcophagus and tomb that has never been robbed. Hawass quickly seizes control of the excavation, fearful of the tomb robbers that still exist in Egypt today.

|ShortSummary    = Hawass leads three fellows to the Five Chambers above the Grand Gallery of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]. The purpose is to examine ancient graffiti on the walls of the Chambers, and explore Hawass' theory that slaves did not build the Pyramids at Giza. During their ascent into the Five Chambers, Hawass closely monitors the humidity inside the Great Pyramid, stating that anything over 80% puts the pyramid and anyone inside in great danger. Meanwhile, Zoe has no choice but to wet herself inside the Fourth Chamber, causing her to be at the opposing end of Hawass's wrath. Later, Hawass reveals his findings in an exclusive television interview, and claims that the great Pyramid would be closed indefinitely in order to protect it from the humidity caused by human activity.

After being convinced to give her a last chance, Hawass takes her and Leslie along to one of his excavations of an unfinished tomb, leaving Lindsay and Derek to remain in [[Saqqara]] to observe the excavation of the tomb in that location. During the trip to the unfinished tomb, Hawass's vehicle breaks down eight miles from the site, and he convinces everyone that they must walk through the desert to get to the site. During this time, Hawass and Zoe reconnect as they find a tribe willing to lend them horses and camels. They arrive at the site four hours late, and Leslie blames Hawass for the "near death" experience of walking through the desert. After they arrive at the site, Hawass's workers discover a rare and important piece of Egyptian history...a beautiful anthropoid sarcophagus from the [[26th Dynasty]]. After a long day, Hawass still is slated to open Cairo's newest night club.

But the archaeologists have persistent problems obtaining permits from authorities and adequate equipment in order to bring up the stone. With a storm fast approaching, and the Minister of Culture and the worldwide international press is waiting on the shoreline, time is limited to get the job done and show the pylon to the world.

'''Chicana feminism''', also called '''Xicanisma''',&lt;ref&gt;IRL
From Chicano to Xicanx: A brief history of a political and cultural identity&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that centered their unique experiences with gender, race, class and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;"The Research Context", by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many feminist methodologies are similar in practice, Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminists by centering their unique lived experiences with gender, race, class, sexuality and nationalism – offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicano/a culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=Aída|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134–161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- BEGIN RESTORE: The following content is from version 691286145 of 21:18, November 18, 2015 by User:Pachuca chula73 --&gt;
Chicana feminism maintains that throughout history, women have been oppressed, and sometimes even abused, in many different societies. In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia and Africa, many women were, for centuries, treated by their fathers, brothers and husbands with discrimination. Women in Latin America, Mexico included, were seen as child-bearers, homemakers, and caregivers. These women had to watch their children, perform household chores, and cook for their husbands. Many men did not consider women to be capable of working outside the home, which is part of the reason why the term "weaker sex" was coined.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to some social standards. In many Latin American cities, for example, women were not seen with good eyes if they spoke to men they did not know. Meanwhile, [[prostitution]], for example, was legal in many Latin American areas, and men were not criticized, but rather seen as heroic, if they had several girlfriends, even if the man was married.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming.  Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens.

During the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the largest group of Chicanos in the United States.

Euro-American women also had their own problems: they were also stereotyped as homemakers, caregivers, and child-bearers. Unlike women of minority races, however, white women largely evaded dealing with [[racism]], unless they or their husbands befriended people of Black or Hispanic background. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, private vs. the public sphere, reproductive rights, and marital rape.

=== Origin ===
Chicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized. Chicanas identify as being consciously aware, self-determined, proud of their roots, heritage, and experience while prioritizing [[La Raza]]. With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238"&gt;Garcia, A. M. (June 1, 1989). The Development of Chicana Feminist Discourse, 1970-1980. Gender and Society, 3, 2, 217-238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seminal text, La Chicana by Elizabeth Martinez, Martinez writes: “She [La Chicana]  is oppressed by the forces of racism, [[imperialism]], and sexism. This can be said of all non-white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women  also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Review of Part I: Implications for Feminist Theorizing''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What are the issues happening in Chicana feminism now and then?'''

Chicana feminism have many different movements within the culture and ethnicities, according to Garcia (1989) the Chicana feminist movement was created to adhere to the specific issues which have had on Chicana women of colour which has originated from the Chicano movement because women desired to be treated equally and have the acceptance and motivation to what the Chicanos were doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=A. M|date=1989|title=The development of Chicana feminist discourse|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=1|pages=217–238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicana feminist movement has certainly influenced many Chicana women to be more active and to defend their rights not just as single women but women in solidarity who come together forming a society with equal contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=A.N|date=1997|title=Garcia, Chicana feminist thought: the basic historical writings|url=|journal=Chicana feminism|volume=1|pages=52–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminist Garcia (1989) has noted that awareness is only the start such awareness becomes the catalyst for change which is what Chicana feminism is about Chicana feminism is also about creating intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=S|date=1980|title=Toward a feminist pedagogy|url=|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|volume=5|pages=48–51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1940s, Mexican-Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican-American empowerment. By the 1960s, the [[Chicano Movement]], also known as ''El Movimiento'', became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican-American workers and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, The [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) organization was founded by [[Cesar Chavez|César Chávez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UFW Chronology|url =http://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-chronology/|publisher=United Farm Workers|accessdate = 2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolores Huerta]], and [[Philip Vera Cruz]].

Between the late 1960s through the 1970s, The Chicano Student Movement began in which students fought and organized for better quality education.&lt;ref name="What is the Chicana Movement"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is the Chicana Movement?|url = http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|website = umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts of organizing the Chicana Feminist Movement began in the later part of the 1960s. During the Chicano Movement,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, O. C. (2002, Fall). [http://postcolonialstudies.emory.edu/chicanafeminism/ Chicana Feminism]. Retrieved May 11, 2014, from Emory University website.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicana women formed committees within Chicano organizations. Similar to the organization of other groups in the Women's Movement, the Chicana feminists organized consciousness-raising groups and held conferences specific to the issues that Chicana women faced.&lt;ref name="segura69-92"&gt;Segura, D. A., and Pesquera, B. M. (January 1, 1992). Beyond Indifference and Antipathy: The Chicana Movement and Chicana Feminist Discourse. Aztlan: a Journal of Chicano Studies, 19, 2, 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although community organizers were working toward empowering the Mexican-American community, the narrative of the Chicano Movement largely ignored the women that were involved with organizing during this time of civil disobedience.

Chicana Feminism serves to highlight a much greater movement than generally perceived; a variety of minority groups are given a platform to confront their oppressors whether that be racism, homophobia, and multiple other forms of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/cf/|title=Chicana Feminism|website=www.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana liberation unshackles individuals, as well as the broader group as a whole, allowing them to live lives as they desire – commanding cultural respect and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Blea, Irene I. 1992. La Chicana and the Intersection of Race, Class, and Gender. New York , NY : Praeger Publishers. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminists collectively realized the importance of connecting the issues of gender with need for improvement with respect to other civil liberties such as socioeconomic background, heritage, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Benita. 2004. Separate Roads to Feminism. New York , NY : Cambridge University Press. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicanas in the Brown Berets ====
The [[Brown Berets]] were a youth group that took on a more militant approach to organizing for the Mexican-American community formed in California in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="kcet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = ¡La Lucha Continua! Gloria Arellanes and Women in the Chicano Movement|url = http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/east-of-east/gloria-arellanes-and-women-in-the-chicano-movement.html|website = KCET|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicana feminist organization ====
The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano Movement and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza|National Chicana Conference]] held in Houston, Texas in May 1971, over 600 women organized to discuss issues surrounding regarding equal access to education, reproductive justice, formation of childcare centers, and more (Smith, 2002).  While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=1477312668|location=Austin, TX|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary chicanas during this time period while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.

One of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference. The women met outside of the conference and drafted a framework for the CFMN that established them as active and knowledgeable community leaders of a people's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, K. (2013). La Hermandad and Chicanas Organizing: The Community Rhetoric of the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional. Community Literacy Journal, 7(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female archetypes ===
Central to much of Chicana feminism is a reclaiming of the female archetypes [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]], [[La Llorona]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Research Context''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado&lt;/ref&gt; These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=Norman : University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292–312|chapter=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.

[[La Virgin de Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]] and [[La Malinche]] have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzaldúa writes, "I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malintzin (also known as Doña Marina by the Spaniards or "La Malinche" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble Indigenous parents in rural Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marina
MEXICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS&lt;/ref&gt; Since Indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12–14, traded to Hernan Cortés as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his "wife" and diplomat. She served as Cortés's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|location=|pages=72|chapter=12. The Nahua Interpreter Malintzin Translates for Hernan Cortés and Moteucçoma (1580)|quote=|editor-last2=Osowski|editor-first2=Edward W.|editor-last3=Porter|editor-first3=Susie S.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bore Cortés a son, Martín, who is considered to be the first mestizo and the beginning of the "Mexican" race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, a scapegoat was needed to justify centuries of colonial rule. Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cortés and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as "Indian", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or  conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cortés to ensure her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

La Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, "rape-able", and always guilty of betrayal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rather than a traitor or a "whore", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cortés. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cortés, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Cristina.

===Criticism===
One critique of Chicana feminism was that it was a separatist movement that would divide the Chicano Movement. Loyalist Chicanas felt that the creation of a separate Chicana feminist movement was a dangerous and divisive political tactic, influenced too heavily by the Anglo women's movement. Loyalists believed that racism was the most important issue Chicanos and Chicanas were facing. They felt that the sexual oppression Chicanas faced from Chicanos was the fault of the system rather than the men, and breaking down the racial oppression affecting both Chicanos and Chicanas would resolve the sexual inequality the women experienced.

Similarly, Chicana feminists have been blamed for tearing at the values of Chicano culture. The first reason for this is that loyalists believed Chicana feminists were anti-family, anti-culture, and anti-man, thus pitting them against the Chicano movement. Furthermore, feminism itself was viewed by many as individualistic and as something that was taking away from other issues, such as racism.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238" /&gt;

However, following the contributions of Chicana feminist writers, including [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], Chicana feminism has gained the support of feminists of diverse backgrounds. The emergence of queer theory and intersectionality in feminist movements has challenged the misogyny of the Chicano movement and has broadened and strengthened the Chicana/o movement to be in solidarity with other people of color in the United States.

== Cultural identities and spirituality ==
The term "Chicano" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it "meshicano" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no "sh" in their vocabulary and pronounced it "mexicano" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many white Americans used the word Chicano to describe Mexican immigrants as poor, unskilled, and ignorant people. Later, the term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Caló (Chicano)|caló]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.

The definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the "American" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into "American" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.

Contemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the “C-H” beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound “ch”, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.

Chicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another “x” at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.nau.edu/10.1177/0921374017727880|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203–212|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been resistance to this change in language and there is discussions of whether or not this is useful from academics and community members, Feminists and queer folk are fighting for this change in language be inclusive as well as creating a new formation of history. The usage of Xicanx is powerful due to trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have been marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.  

=== Duality and "The New Mestiza" ===
The concept of "The New Mestiza" comes from feminist author, Gloria Anzaldúa. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: "In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The “new mestiza” was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.

=== Mujerista ===
Mujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's "Womanist" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada María Isasi-Díaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.&lt;ref&gt;Tijerina-Revilla, A.

New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to redefine the Latina/o identity.

=== Nepantla spirituality ===
[[Nepantla]] is a [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] word which translates to "in the middle of it" or "middle". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzaldúa, who coined the term, "Nepantlera". "Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzaldúan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.

=== Body Politics ===
Suzanne Bost discuss in ''Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature,'' about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism. It has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how “[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature|last=Bost|first=Suzanne|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780823230846|location=|pages=193–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now looking beyond just looking at race, but incorporating intersectionality and how mobility, accessibility, mental and physical abilities, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicana's. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua’s diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. “Since there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing it’s effects on what is going on in time. Identifying as Chicana/o/x means to be political and the body that you inhabit will be politicized as well, to understand how it is being politicized along with your identities is to look at how it is done. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this, Chicana feminism hasn’t ended it is just manifesting in different ways now.

=== Queer Interventions ===
Chicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for an inclusion and honoring of the cultures’ joteria. In La conciencia de la mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, “the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose. We are blending that proves that all blood is intricately woven together and that we are spawned out of similar souls”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza, 4th Edition|last=Anzaldua|first=Gloria|publisher=aunt lute|year=1987|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=99–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention centers queerness as a focal part of liberation, a lived experience that cannot be ignored or excluded.

In Queer Aztlan: the Reformation of Chicano Tribe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latino/a Thought : Culture, Politics, and Society|last=Vázquez|first=Francisco H|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780742563544|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherrie Moraga interrogates the construction of Chicano identity in relation with queerness. Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements. Moraga also discusses Aztlan, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, how this communidad and ideas need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. "Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully.

In "Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community," &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maythee|first1=Rojas|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology ''Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About|last=Trujillo|first=Carla|publisher=Third Woman Press|year=1991|isbn=9780943219066|location=|pages=186–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1991) was published by Third Woman Press. This anthology was controversial and banned because of its cover art which was a piece by Ester Hernandez titled ''La Ofrenda''. Since its original publication, the book has been re-published however, the cover art has changed. This anthology includes poetry and essays by Chicana women creating new understandings of self through their sexuality and race. This book brings visibility to Lesbian Chicana writers and artists whose work hasn't been as mainstream as other feminist artists. The contributions pages gives information about the writers and their histories, this also makes the book transparent about who is writing and bringing visibility to various different names.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''ECOFEMINISM IN CHICANA FEMINIST MOVEMENT'''

Chicana environmentalism combines the notion of ecofeminism and environmental justice whilst also providing a critique on the westernised view of ecofeminism and the toxicity caused by disregarding a certain race and the knowledge and history that they possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=C.M|date=2010|title=Chicana Environmentalisms: Deterritorialization as a Practice of Decolonization|url=|journal=The Ohio State University Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest terms, Ecofeminism can be defined as the significant connection between the oppression of women and nature, and the ways in which the two can coincide harmoniously.

After the term ‘ecofeminism’ was derived in the 70’s, there has been a significant increase in the amount of recognition women have received regarding creating positive alternatives for sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckingham|first=S|date=2004|title=Ecofeminism in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=170|pages=146–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to environmental sustainability being predominately of a western, patriarchal mindset its important for women, specifically indigenous women, to reject these premises and follow more nurturing, traditional practices. Environmental conservation in Chicana culture can be interpreted in many different ways. Firstly, it can be seen as empowerment of ones’ culture, i.e. rejecting Eurocentric ideologies and believing in the “womanness” of curandera. Curandera in Mexican American culture is believed to have healing powers. Unpacking the notion of spirituality, the practise of curandera are often observed from the view point of the patriarchal spirituality as being the creation of witchcraft. Derived from European Christianity, curandera’s "earth-based healing and nature-based spirituality" was something to be feared by those who disregarded its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng-Levine|first=J|date=1997|title=Neocolonialism, postcolonial ecology, and ecofeminism in the works of Native American, Chicano/a, and international writers|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco feminism is not just a birth right in Chicana history, but it is also strategic. Eco feminism allows for the empowerment of women and provides an authority position for women in society.  This power comes from an association of being nature goddesses and creates a sense of privilege that would otherwise cease to exist.

Some of the ways in which Chicana women take back their ecological and ontological power can be seen through the use of literature and art. For example, murals in the San Francisco Bay area. Juana Alicia’s La Llorona’s Sacred Waters (2004) and MaestraPeace (1994), a collaboration among Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edith Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton, and Irene Pérez. La Llorana’s Sacred Waters murals exhibits many aspects of ecofeminism in the ways in which it draws to the devastation of colonialism and the ways in which it destroyed both the natural environment and the people that inhabited it. The mural also signifies the clear links between the relationship of women and nature. Chalchiuhtlicue is an indigenous goddess of the lakes and rivers, whilst also being associated with strong fertility.

In La llorana’s mural, Chalchiuhtlicue has a scroll rendering from her mouth with the message that she is speaking out against the horrid social conditions of her peoples.

Ecofeminism has always been a dominant part of the Chicana history, although very poorly documented. The diversity in the movement accounts for pushing towards an epistemological and ontological form of decolonization. The movement has been amplified through the reorienting of representation and by unpacking the way individuals absorbs the relationships between nature and spiritual relations.

=== Chicana art ===
Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries traditional Mexican-American values.

=== Chicana literature ===
{{See also|Xicana literature}}
Since the 1970s, many Chicana writers (such as [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Ana Castillo]]) have expressed their own definitions of Chicana feminism through their books. Moraga and Anzaldúa edited an anthology of writing by [[women of color]] titled ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'' (published by [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]]) in the early 1980s. Cherríe Moraga, along with [[Ana Castillo]] and [[Norma Alarcón]], adapted this anthology into a Spanish-language text titled ''Esta Puente, Mi Espalda: Voces de Mujeres Tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos''. Anzaldúa also published the [[bilingual]] (Spanish/English) anthology, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma Gómez, and Cherríe Moraga published a collection of stories titled ''Cuentos: Stories by Latinas'', also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

The first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Massacre of the Dreamers : Essays on Xicanisma. 20th Anniversary Updated Edition.|last=Castillo|first=Anna|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=9780826353580|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ramos and the [[Latina Lesbian History Project]] compiled an anthology including [[tatiana de la tierra]]'s first published poem, "De ambiente",&lt;ref&gt;De La Tierra, Tatiana. "Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoción." ''I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004)'' 172.&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[oral history|oral histories]] of Latina lesbians called ''Compañeras: Latina Lesbians'' (1987).

Chicana lesbian-feminist poet Gloria Anzaldua points out that labeling a writer based on their [[social position]] allows for readers to understand the writers' location in society. However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994). To(o) Queer the Writer—Loca, escritoria y chicana. from Betsy Warland, Ed., ''Inversions: Writings by Queer Dykes and Lesbians'', 263-276. Vancouver: Press Gang Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicana music ===
Continually left absent from Chicano music history, many Chicana musical artists, such as [[Rita Vidaurri]] and María de Luz Flores Aceves, more commonly known as [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], from the 1940s and 50s, can be credited with many of strides that Chicana Feminist movements have made in the past century. For example, Vidaurri and Aceves were among the first [[Mexican people|mexicana]] women to wear [[charro]] pants while performing rancheras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By challenging their own conflicting backgrounds and ideologies, Chicana musicians have continually broken the gender norms of their culture, and therefore created a space for conversation and change in the Latino communities.

There are many important figures in Chicana music history, each one giving a new social identity to Chicanas through their music. An important example of a Chicana musician is [[Rosita Fernández]], an artist from San Antonio, Texas. Popular in the mid 20th century, she was called "San Antonio's First Lady of Song" by [[Lady Bird Johnson]], the [[Tejano]] singer is a symbol of Chicana feminism for many Mexican Americans still today. She was described as "larger than life", repeatedly performing in [[china poblana]] dresses, throughout her career, which last more than 60 years. However, she never received a great deal of fame outside of the San Antonio, despite her long reign as one of the most active Mexican American woman public performers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2419">'''Chinese au pairs in the United States''' have been employed since 2007. In 2002, Chinese [[au pair]] applicants were first sent to Europe. In 2006, plans to bring a Chinese au pair to the United States were set into motion and in March 2007, Hongbin Yu of [[Harbin]] was the first Chinese au pair to arrive in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bellafante, Ginia (2006) To Give Children an Edge, Au Pairs From China, from https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/us/05aupair.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The au pair concept was introduced in [[China]] in 2001 by the [[HHS Center]] (the first au pair agency in China), and was transcribed ''Hu Hui Sheng'' in [[Pinyin]] (互惠生). In 2007, negotiations between agencies in China and the United States were successful and the [[American Cultural Exchange]] (Go Au Pair) became the first [[Au pair organizations in the United States|organization]] to bring a Chinese au pair to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goaupair.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese au pairs are desirable by American host families. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online International]] attribute this trend to the growing number of Chinese baby adoptions and the desire of parents to teach their children Mandarin, to capitalize on China’s economic influence.&lt;ref&gt;

The inbound au pair program in China began; as of 2012, there were over 1,000 au pair applicants from around the world and  over 100 Chinese families interested in participating in the program.

The au pair program in China is supported by the Department of Education and the Administration of Exit and Entry of the Beijing Public Security Bureau.

'''Cultural diplomacy''' a type of [[public diplomacy]] and [[soft power]] that includes the "exchange of ideas, information, art, language  and other aspects of culture among nations and their peoples in order to foster mutual understanding".&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of cultural diplomacy is for the people of a foreign nation to develop an understanding of the nation's ideals and institutions in an effort to build broad support for economic and political goals.&lt;ref&gt;Mary N. Maack, "Books and Libraries as Instruments of Cultural Diplomacy in Francophone Africa during the Cold War," Libraries &amp; Culture 36, no. 1 (Winter 2001): 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence "cultural diplomacy reveals the soul of a nation", which in turn creates influence.&lt;ref name="AdvisoryCommittee"&gt;United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though often overlooked, cultural diplomacy can and does play an important role in achieving national security efforts.

== Definition ==
[[Culture]] is a set of values and practices that create meaning for society.  This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy.  It is a type of [[soft power]], which is the "ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments.  It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation.  Cultural diplomacy is also a component of [[public diplomacy]].  Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large".&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed.  This comes from knowledge of the other's culture."&lt;ref name="Lord"&gt;Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural diplomacy has been called the "linchpin of public diplomacy" because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation.&lt;ref name="AdvisoryCommittee" /&gt;  In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked.

Richard T. Arndt, a former State Department cultural diplomacy practitioner, said "Cultural relations grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions of trade and tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If that is correct, cultural diplomacy can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests."&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is important to note that, while cultural diplomacy is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. Cultural diplomacy attempts to manage the international environment by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Cull, "Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  An important aspect of this is listening- cultural diplomacy is meant to be a two-way exchange.&lt;ref&gt;United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 7 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation.  Cultural diplomacy derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Cull, "Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen{{By whom|date=November 2016}} as a silent weapon in gaining control over another nation with the use of non-violent methods to perpetrate a relationship of mutual understanding and support among the countries involved.

== Purpose ==

Ultimately, the goal of cultural diplomacy is to influence a foreign audience and use that influence, which is built up over the long term, as a sort of good will reserve to win support for policies.  It seeks to harness the elements of culture to induce foreigners to:&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
* have a positive view of the country's people, culture and policies,
* induce greater cooperation between the two nations,
* aid in changing the policies or political environment of the target nation,
* prevent, manage and mitigate conflict with the target nation.

In turn, cultural diplomacy can help a nation better understand the foreign nation it is engaged with and it fosters mutual understanding.  Cultural diplomacy is a way of conducting international relations without expecting anything in return in the way that traditional diplomacy typically expects.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural exchange programs work as a medium to relay a favourable impression of the foreign country in order to gain outsiders' understanding and approval in their cultural practices and naturalize their social norms among other cultures.&lt;ref name="Foreign Affairs"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Foreign Affairs|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/|website = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, cultural diplomacy is more focused on the longer term and less on specific policy matters.&lt;ref name="Lord" /&gt;  The intent is to build up influence over the long term for when it is needed by engaging people directly.  This influence has implications ranging from national security to increasing tourism and commercial opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Leonard, "Diplomacy by Other Means," Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  It allows the government to create a "foundation of trust" and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to-people contact.  Another unique and important element of cultural diplomacy is its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit.  In short, cultural diplomacy plants the seeds of ideals, ideas, political arguments, spiritual perceptions and a general view point of the world that may or may not flourish in a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 3, 4, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, ideologies spread by cultural diplomacy about the values that American people believe in enables those that seek a better life to look towards the Western world where happiness and freedom are portrayed as desirable and achievable goals.&lt;ref name="Foreign Affairs"/&gt;

== Link to national security ==

First and foremost, cultural diplomacy is a demonstration of national power because it demonstrates to foreign audiences every aspect of culture, including wealth, scientific and technological advances, competitiveness in everything from sports and industry to military power, and a nation's overall confidence.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  The perception of power obviously has important implications for a nation's ability to ensure its security.  Furthermore, because cultural diplomacy includes political and ideological arguments, and uses the language of persuasion and advocacy, it can be used as an instrument of [[political warfare]] and be useful in achieving traditional goals of war.&lt;ref name="Waller"&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;   A Chinese activist was quoted as saying "We've seen a lot of Hollywood movies – they feature weddings, funerals and going to court.  So now we think it's only natural to go to court a few times in your life."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of a cultural export – Hollywood movies – possibly having a subtle effect on the legal system in China, which could ultimately benefit the United States or any other nation which wishes to see a more democratic China.  This is the way in which ideas and perceptions can ultimately affect the ability of a nation to achieve its national security goals.

In terms of policy that supports national security goals,  the information revolution has created an increasingly connected world in which public perceptions of values and motivations can create an enabling or disabling environment in the quest for international support of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Leonard, "Diplomacy by Other Means," Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The struggle to affect important international developments is increasingly about winning the information struggle to define the interpretation of states' actions.  If an action is not interpreted abroad as the nation meant to it be, then the action itself can become meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Frederic Metzl, "Popular Diplomacy," Daedalus 128, no. 2 (Spring 1999): 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural diplomacy can create an environment in which a nation is received as basically good, which in turn can help frame its actions in a positive light.

Participants in cultural diplomacy often have insights into foreign attitudes that official embassy employees do not.  This can be used to better understand a foreign nation's intentions and capabilities.   It can also be used to counter hostile propaganda and the collection of open source intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, cultural diplomacy has the potential to demonstrate national power, create an environment conducive to support, and assist in the collection and interpretation of information.  This, in turn, aids in the interpretation of intelligence, enhances a nation's prestige and aids in garnering support for policies abroad.  All of these factors affect a nation's security, thus, cultural diplomacy has an effect on, and a role to play, in regards to national security.

==Tools and examples==

Cultural diplomacy can and does utilize every aspect of a nation's culture.  This includes:&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy," in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The arts including films, dance, music, painting, sculpture, etc.
* Exhibitions which offer the potential to showcase numerous objects of culture
* Educational programs such as universities and language programs abroad
* Exchanges- scientific, artistic, educational etc.
* Literature- the establishment of libraries abroad and translation of popular and national works
* Broadcasting of news and cultural programs
* Gifts to a nation, which demonstrates thoughtfulness and respect 
* Religious diplomacy, including inter-religious dialogue 
* Promotion and explanation of ideas and social policies

All of these tools seek to bring understanding of a nation's culture to foreign audiences. They work best when they are proven to be relevant to the target audience, which requires an understanding of the audience.  The tools can be utilized by working through NGOs, diasporas and political parties abroad, which may help with the challenge of relevance and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Leonard, "Diplomacy by Other Means," Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 51, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tools are generally not created by a government, but produced by the culture and then the government facilitates their expression abroad to a foreign audience, with the purpose of gaining influence.

=== The arts ===
 [[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Migrant Mother'' (1936), Dorothea Lange]]
In the 1950s the Soviet Union had a reputation that was associated with peace, international class solidarity and progress due to its sponsorship of local revolutionary movements for liberation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}  The United States was known for its involvement in the [[Korean War]] and for preserving the status quo.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}  In an effort to change this perception,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) sponsored a photographic exhibition titled [[The Family of Man]].  The display originally showed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, but then USIA helped the display to be seen in 91 locations in 39 countries.  The 503 photographs by 237 professional and amateur photographers were curated and put together by [[Edward Steichen]].  The images showed glimpses of everyday human life in its various stages; courtship, birth, parenting, work, self-expression, etc., including images from the [[Great Depression]].  The images were multi-cultured and only a few were overtly political serving to show the eclecticism and diversity of American culture, which is America's soft power foundation.   The display was extremely popular and attracted large numbers of crowds, in short America "showed the world, the world and got credit for it".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Cull, "Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar effort was carried out by the [[United States Department of State]] in February 2002 entitled Images from Ground Zero.  The display included 27 images, detailing the [[September 11 attacks]] by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] that circulated, with the backing of embassies and consulates, to 60 nations.  The display was intended to shape and maintain the public memory of the attack and its aftermath.  The display sought to show the human side of the tragedy, and not just the destruction of buildings.  The display was also intended to show a story of recovery and resolution through documenting not only the grief and pain, but also the recovery efforts.  In many countries where the display was run, it was personalized for the population.  For example, relatives of those who died in the Towers were often invited to the event openings.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Kennedy, "Remembering September 11: Photography as Cultural Diplomacy," International Affairs 79, no. 2 (March 2003): 315-323.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the US was able to put their own spin on the tragedy and keep the world from forgetting.

=== Exhibitions ===
[[File:Pepsi SU label.svg|thumb|Pepsi SU label]]
Exhibitions were often used during the [[Cold War]] to demonstrate culture and progress by both the United States and the Soviet Union.  In 1959, the [[American National Exhibition]] was held on [[Sokolniki Park]] in Moscow.  The exhibition was opened by Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] and attended by [[Walt Disney]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[William Randolph Hearst]], and senior executives from Pepsi, Kodak and Macy's.  It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of American products such as Pepsi.  There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird's Eye frozen meal be prepared.  An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian.  The most popular question was "what is the meaning of the American Dream?"  The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition.  But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country.  The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it out anyway.  The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue.  The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian.  This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions.  The ambassador to Moscow, [[Llewellyn Thompson]], commented that "the exhibition would be 'worth more to us than five new battleships."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas John. Cull, The Cold War and the United States Information Agency: American Propaganda and Public Diplomacy, 1945-1989 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 162-167.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exhibitions like this were used to display the best a culture had to offer and basically show off in a way that appeared non threatening and even friendly.

===Exchanges===

The usefulness of exchanges is based on two assumptions- some form of political intent lies behind the exchange and the result will have some sort of political effect.  The idea is that exchanges will create a network of influential people abroad that will tie them to their host country and will appreciate their host country more due to their time spent there.&lt;ref&gt;Giles Scott-Smith, "Mapping the Undefinable: Some Thoughts on the Relevance of Exchange Programs within International Relations Theory," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 16 (March 2008): 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exchanges generally take place at a young age, giving the host country the opportunity to create an attachment and gain influence at a young impressionable age.&lt;ref name="Lord" /&gt;

An example of the possible usefulness of exchanges is provided by the United States [[Fulbright Program]].  Some statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eca.state.gov/fulbright/fulbright-alumni/notable-fulbrighters|title=Notable Fulbrighters |website =  Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate = 25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 59 alumni from 14 countries have been awarded the Nobel Prize
* 82 alumni have received Pulitzer Prizes
* 37 Fulbright alumni have served as heads of state or government

Some Prominent Fulbright alumni include: 
* [[Garry Conille]], Former Prime Minister of Haiti 
* [[Muhammad Yunus]], Founder of Grameen Bank and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize recipient
* [[John Atta Mills]], President of Ghana 
* [[Lee Evans (athlete)|Lee Evans]], Olympic Gold Medalist 
* [[Riccardo Giacconi]], physicist and 2002 Nobel Laureate 
* [[Renée Fleming]], soprano 
* [[Jonathan Franzen]], writer

This is not to say that exchanges guarantee that participants will look favorably upon their host nation, but the hope is that they will.

=== TV, music, film===
[[File:The Fabs.JPG|thumb|The Fabs]]
Popular entertainment is a statement about the society which it is portraying.&lt;ref name = borgerson&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last1=Borgerson|first1=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|last2=Schroeder|first2 = Jonathan E. |last3 = Miller|first3 = Daniel|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cultural displays can carry important messages regarding individualism, consumer choices and other values.&lt;ref name = borgerson/&gt;  For example, Soviet audiences watching American films learned that Americans owned their own cars, did not have to stand in long lines to purchase food, and did not live in communal apartments.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations were not intended to be political messages when Hollywood created the films, but they none-the-less carried a message.

Cultural programming featuring [[Latin Jazz]] music was already recognized by the [[United States Department of State]] as an important diplomatic tool during the [[World War II]] period. In the early 1940s, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] at the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] collaborated with [[Edmund A. Chester]] of the [[CBS]] radio broadcasting network in order to showcase leading musicians from both North and South America for audiences on both continents. Musical artists such as [[Alfredo Antonini]], [[Terig Tucci]], [[John Serry Sr.]], [[Miguel Sandoval (composer)|Miguel Sandoval]], [[Juan Arvizu]], [[Elsa Miranda]], [[Eva Garza]] and [[Nestor Mesta Chayres]] participated in this truly international effort to foster peace throughout the Americas through shared musical performances ''(See [[Viva América]])''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Pictorial History of Radio''.

In the post World War II era, the United States Army also acknowledged the importance of cultural programming as a valuable diplomatic tool amidst the ruins in Europe. In 1952 the [[U.S. Seventh Army]] enlisted the expertise of the young conductor [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Adler]] to establish the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] in Stuttgart, Germany in order to demonstrate the shared cultural heritage of America and Europe. &lt;ref&gt; [http://journal.juilliard.edu/journal/1310/samuel-adler ''The Julilliard Journal'' Faculty Portraits of Samuel Adler at the Juilliard School of Music, New York, October 2013 on Juilliard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lIfhsSoI-9YC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra+Samuel+Adler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAuviTi4bdAhUtrVkKHe7aARk4FBDoAQg_MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=Seventh%20Army%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20Samuel%20Adler&amp;f=false ''A Conductor's Guide to Choral-Orchestral Works, Part 1''] Jonathan D.

Jazz played a critical role during the Cold War in establishing political ties. Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative way of living by introducing a new style of music with a lose structure and improvisation.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"&gt;Richmond, Yale. Cultural Exchange and the Cold War: Raising the Iron Curtain. (University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 2004), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Satchmo"&gt;Von Eschen, Penny M,  Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War. (Harvard University Press, 2004), 10, 13, 34, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1955, the New York Times declared Louis Armstrong as America's most effective ambassador. What American diplomats could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did. This article claimed that musicians, such as Armstrong, created a universal language to communicate.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt;

Jazz originally surfaced in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, but quickly faded. After World War II, jazz began to reemerge, but was condemned by [[Andrei Zhdanov]].&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt; He considered jazz as corrupt and capitalistic due to the fact that it grew out of the United States during a time of political unrest.&lt;ref name="Jazz diplomacy"&gt;Fosler-Lussier, Danielle, "Jazz Diplomacy: Promoting America in Cold War Era by Lisa E. Davenport (review)," American Music 31, no. 1, (Spring 2013), 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s to 1960s, the Civil Rights movement, the [[decolonization of Africa]] and [[Decolonization of Asia|Asia]], and the cultural and political rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union created the need for cultural exchange.&lt;ref name="Jazz diplomacy"/&gt; As a result, the United States government sent a jazz band composed of African American musicians abroad to tour places, including the Middle East and Africa, with the goal of the black musicians establishing connections with their African heritage.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt;

Duke Ellington, B.B. King, and Dizzy Gillespie all made trips to Africa that fostered connections with the African diaspora.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt; In 1956, [[Dizzy Gillespie]] took on the role as a musical ambassador during his trip to the Middle East. He reported to President Eisenhower that he and his jazz band were effective against Red propaganda.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt; With their interracial group, the jazz band was able to communicate across social and language barriers. During the band's trip to Athens, Greece, a performance transformed an audience of Anti-American students angered by the U.S. stance on Greece's right-wing dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt; By the end of the performance, Gillespie said the audience loved the music and threw him up on their shoulders after the performance. Diplomats emphasized the positive effects of musical diplomacy on the public.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt;

From 1955 to 1996, jazz producer [[Willis Conover]] hosted a music program called "Music USA," for the Voice of America to assist in the emergence of jazz musicians as U.S. ambassadors.&lt;ref name="Satchmo"/&gt; Conover explained: "Jazz is a cross between total discipline and anarchy," for the way the musicians agree on tempo, key, and chord, but is distinguishable by its freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt; As many as thirty million listeners worldwide, including millions in the Soviet Union, listened to the forty-five minutes of pop music and forty-five minutes of jazz with a newscast preceding each. Many critics have stated that Conover's program played a major role in the resurgence of jazz within the Soviet Union after the WWII.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt; Many historians believe that this freedom aspect of jazz was representative of the American culture during this time.

The effect [[The Beatles]] had in Russia during the [[Cold War]] is an example of how music artists and their songs can become political. During this time, rock music channeled liberal "Western" ideas as a progressive and modernized art form.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt; The Beatles symbolized the Western culture in a way that introduced new ideas that many believe assisted in the collapse of communism.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;John Alter, "You say you want a revolution," Newsweek (September 22, 2003): 37.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Beatles served as cultural diplomats through their popularity in the Soviet Union. Their music fostered youth communication and united people with a common spirit of popular culture.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt;

Kolya Vasin, the founder of The Beatles museum and the Temple of Love, Peace and Music in St. Petersburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.something-books.com/index.php/Kolya-Vasin/menu-id-136.html|title=Beatles books &amp; records discography :: Something Books - Kolya Vasin|author=Dmitri Rogov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented that The Beatles "were like an integrity test. When anyone said anything against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/20/beatles-soviet-union-first-rip-iron-curtain|title=For young Soviets, the Beatles were a first, mutinous rip in the iron curtain|author=Ed Vulliamy|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government to prevent the spread of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music.&lt;ref&gt;Bratersky, Alexander, "Back in the USSR: the Beatles shaped a generation in Soviet Russia," Russia: beyond the headlines.(November 8, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Pavel Palazchenko, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...".&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt; Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.&lt;ref name="Cultural exchange"/&gt;

In this way the music of The Beatles struck a political chord in the Soviet Union, even when the songs were not meant to be political.  This contact went both ways.  In 1968, when the song "Back in the USSR" was released, the album included a quote on the cover from [[Paul McCartney]] that read "In releasing this record, made especially and exclusively for the USSR, I am extending a hand of peace and friendship to the Soviet people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/russianow/culture/9663838/beatles-ussr-soviet-russia.html|title=Back in the USSR: the Beatles shaped a generation in Soviet Russia|author=Alexander Bratersky, special to Russia Now|date=8 November 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Paul McCartney's first trip to Russia in May 2003, nearly half a million fans greeted him. One Russian critic reported, "The only person in Red Square who wasn't moved was Lenin".&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; This is an example of how products of culture can have an influence on the people they reach outside of their own country.  It also shows how a private citizen can unintentionally become a cultural ambassador of sorts.

===Place branding===

This Image and reputation has become an essential part of a "state's strategic equity".  [[Place branding]] is "the totality of the thoughts, feelings, associations and expectations that come to mind when a prospect or consumer is exposed to an entity's name, logo, products, services, events, or any design or symbol representing them."  Place branding is required to make a country's image acceptable for investment, tourism, political power, etc.  As Joseph Nye commented, "in an information age, it is often the side which has the better side of the story that wins," this has resulted in a shift from old style diplomacy to encompass brand building and reputation management.  In short, a country can use its culture to create a brand for itself which represents positive values and image.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Van Ham, "Place Branding: The State of the Art," The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 127-133, doi:10.1177/0002716207312274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==

Cultural diplomacy presents a number of unique challenges to any government attempting to carry out cultural diplomacy programs.  Most ideas that a foreign population observes are not in the government's control.  The government does not usually produce the books, music, films, TV programs, consumer products, etc. that reaches an audience.  The most the government can do is try to work to create openings so the message can get through to mass audiences abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Leonard, "Diplomacy by Other Means," Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  To be cultural relevant in the age of globalization, a government must exercise control over the flows of information and communication technologies, including trade.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Belanger, "Redefining Cultural Diplomacy: Cultural Security and Foreign Policy in Canada," Political Psychology 20, no. 4 (December 1999): 677-8, doi:10.1111/0162-895X.00164.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also difficult for governments that operate in a free market society where the government does not control the bulk of information flows.  What the government can do is work to protect cultural exports where they flourish, by utilizing trade agreements or gaining access for foreign telecommunication networks.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Belanger, "Redefining Cultural Diplomacy: Cultural Security and Foreign Policy in Canada," Political Psychology 20, no. 4 (December 1999): 678, doi:10.1111/0162-895X.00164.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that foreign government officials may oppose or resist certain cultural exports while the people cheer them on.  This can make support for official policies difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name="Nye"&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural activities may be both a blessing and a curse to a nation.  This may be the case if certain elements of a culture are offensive to the foreign audience.  Certain cultural activities can also undermine national policy objectives.  An example of this was the very public American dissent to the [[Iraq War]] while official government policy still supported it.&lt;ref name="Waller" /&gt;  Simultaneously the prevalence of the protest may have attracted some foreigners to the openness of America.&lt;ref name="Nye" /&gt;  The success of cultural diplomacy is also difficult to measure.

Eraillures usually form only when a [[hammerstone]] is used for lithic reduction, and then only occasionally; use of 'soft' hammer fabricators made from [[bone]], [[antler]], and [[wood]] produce different flake characteristics but may also produce an eraillure in rare cases.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7980">'''Essex man''' and '''Mondeo man''' are [[stereotype|stereotypical]] figures which were popularised in 1990s [[England]]. "Essex man" as a political figure is an example of a type of [[Median voter theory|median voter]] and was used to help explain the electoral successes of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the previous decade. The closely related "Mondeo man" was identified as the sort of voter the Labour Party needed to attract to win the election of 1997.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;Ollie Stone-Lee, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4119695.stm  Who's the new Mondeo man?], ''BBC News'' 2 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Although the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] is often considered the "natural choice" for the [[working-class]], there has traditionally been a group within that class who have voted [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]],&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, D., ''Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; who are distinct from the "Essex man" phenomenon. After the [[Second World War]], there was considerable social change in [[South East England]]. 

Working class English families were encouraged to leave the war damaged slums in [[inner London]] and move to newly built council owned properties in the [[suburb]]s and [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]]s in the [[home counties]], including [[Basildon]] and [[Harlow]] in [[Essex]]. With the decline of manufacturing and skilled manual work in the 1980s, this group increasingly looked to [[middle-class]] professions for employment, or became self employed. 

Their children enjoyed housing, [[education]] and employment opportunities far removed from the experiences of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, T., ''Social Change and the Middle Classes'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essex man and Thatcherism==
[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies from 1979 to 1990 included: lower taxation, control of inflation and sale of council housing stock at subsidised prices. These policies (in particular, the [[right to buy scheme]]) are thought to have caused many people who had traditionally voted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in Essex to switch their allegiance in the elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]].&lt;ref name="Israeli, R. 2002"&gt;Israeli, R. and Ball, S., ''Mass Conservatism'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) lists the earliest reference to the Essex man as one from 7 October 1990 in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', although a reference to 26 January 1990 issue of ''Campaign'': "Representative &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[David Amess]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of new Essex man, working class, father electrician, right wing, keen hanger, noisily rambunctious, no subtlety".&lt;ref&gt; "What sort of person signs up as an advertiser?", ''Campaign'', January 26, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the similarities between the politics of Thatcher's Britain and [[Ronald Reagan]]'s America, the contemporary term "[[Reagan Democrat]]" is roughly analogous to "Essex man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biressi|first=Anita|title=Class and Contemporary British Culture|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780230240568|pages=23–37|author2=Heather Nunn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mondeo man==
[[File:Mondeo 1995 Verona 18TD.jpg|250px|thumb|A 1995 [[Ford Mondeo]] that a "Mondeo man" may have aspired to own.]]
The concept of the "Mondeo man" was popularised by a phrase used by then [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], [[Tony Blair]] at the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in October 1996. He recalled a [[Ford Sierra]] owner he had canvassed in [[the Midlands]] whilst campaigning for the general election of [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=202 British Political Speech | Speech Archive], "BritishPoliticalSpeech", accessed 25 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The man was a self employed electrician, who Blair met while the man was polishing his car at the weekend, and told Blair that he was an ex Labour voter who had bought his [[council house]], owned his own car, and wondered what the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had to offer him given the party's history of raising taxes and mortgage rates: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;His dad voted Labour, he said. He used to vote Labour, too. But he'd bought his own house now. He'd set up his own business. He was doing very nicely. "So I've become a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]]" he said. In that moment, he crystallised for me the basis of our failure... His instincts were to get on in life. And he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450806/Mondeo-Man-Now-Tories-chase-Miss-Staff-Room.html#ixzz1N52Ayh77 Mondeo Man? Now Tories chase Miss Staff Room], ''Daily Mail'', 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This is the story that is often credited with inspiring Blair's concept of [[New Labour]], and the "Mondeo man" superseded the "Essex man", as the target of the campaign for the general election of 1997 for the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Streeter, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/election-97-this-time-prime-target-is-mondeo-man-1266242.html Election '97: This time, prime target is Mondeo Man], ''The Independent'', 10 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; (By 1993, the Sierra had been replaced by the Mondeo in the Ford model range, hence the misquote that gave birth to Mondeo Man).&lt;ref&gt;George Jones, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2746636/Does-Mondeo-Man-matter-any-more.html Does ''Mondeo Man'' Matter Any More?], ''Daily Telegraph'', 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/31/taxation-squeezing-middle-britain Taxation: Squeezing middle Britain] ''The Guardian'', Monday 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Blair subsequently won the general election of [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]], with a record landslide majority of 179 MPs.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Prostitutes gave the nickname "Mondeo man" to [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]], who murdered five prostitutes during the end of 2006.

== Subsequent developments ==
Every constituency in Essex voted 'leave' in the [[Brexit|2016 referendum to leave the European Union]]. In particular, the Essex districts [[Castle Point (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Point]] and [[Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|Thurrock]] ranked among the top five districts for the percentage of Brexit votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36617396|title=Two of UK's top Leave districts in Essex|date=2016-06-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/brexit-on-sea-why-do-voters-on-essexs-protected-coast-want-out-of-europe|title=Brexit-on-sea: Why do voters on Essex's protected coast want out of Europe?|last=Vidal|first=John|date=2016-06-21|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ethnohistory''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] established in 1954 and published quarterly by [[Duke University Press]] on behalf of the American Society for Ethnohistory.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnohistory.dukejournals.org/, accessed July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnohistory.org/, accessed July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes articles and reviews in the fields of ethnohistory, historical anthropology and social and cultural history. Like its sponsoring professional society, ''Ethnohistory'' has represented a meeting ground between scholars in the disciplines of history and anthropology. Geography and other disciplines have been increasingly represented in its pages over time. Founded by scholars focused primarily on studies of Native North America, the journal has, over its history, progressively become more global in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''Family resemblance''' ({{lang-de|Familienähnlichkeit}}) is a philosophical idea made popular by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], with the best known exposition given in his posthumously published book ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that things which could be thought to be connected by one essential common feature may in fact be connected by a series of overlapping similarities, where no one feature is common to all of the things. Games, which Wittgenstein used as an example to explain the notion, have become the paradigmatic example of a group that is related by family resemblances. It has been suggested that Wittgenstein picked up the idea and the term from [[Nietzsche]], who had been using it, as did many nineteenth century philologists, when discoursing about [[language families]].&lt;ref&gt;Sluga H., ''Family Resemlance'', Grazer Philosophische Studien 71 (2006) 1; see also ''A Wittgenstein Dictionary'',  ed. H.-J. Glock, London:Blackwell 1996
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term "Family resemblance" is found in a note from 1930, commenting on [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L.,(1998) [[Culture and Value]], London:Blackwell, p 14.  Spengler's influence in this and other forms has been considered in papers published after this collection of notes became available, see e.g. DeAngelis W., "Wittgenstein and Spengler," Dialogue 33 (1994):41–61&lt;/ref&gt; The notion itself features widely in Wittgenstein's later work, and in the ''Investigations'' it is introduced in response to questions about the general form of [[proposition]]s and the essence of language – questions which were central to Wittgenstein throughout his philosophical career. This suggests that family resemblance was of prime importance for Wittgenstein's later philosophy; however, like many of his ideas, it is hard to find precise agreement within the secondary literature on either its place within Wittgenstein's later thought or on its wider philosophical significance.

Since the publication of the ''Investigations,'' the notion of family resemblance has been discussed extensively not only in the philosophical literature, but also, for example, in works dealing with classification where the approach is described as "polythetic", distinguishing it from the traditional approach known now as "monothetic". [[Prototype theory]] is a recent development in [[cognitive science]] where this idea has also been explored. As the idea gains popularity, earlier instances of its occurrence are  rediscovered e.g. in 18th century [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]],&lt;ref name="Winsor"&gt;Winsor M., 2003, ''Non-essentialist methods in pre-Darwinian taxonomy'', Biology and Philosophy 18 (2003) 387–400&lt;/ref&gt; in the writings of [[Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="Needham" /&gt; or [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz  W.,'' Postawa estetyczna, literacka i poetycka'' (1933) where it is called 'domino resemblance'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical context==
The local context where the topic of family resemblances appears is Wittgenstein's critique of language. In ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' §65-71 the plurality of language uses is compared to the plurality of games. Next it is asserted that games have common features but no one feature is found in all of them. The whole argument has become famous under the heading 'language games'.

The larger context in which Wittgenstein's philosophy is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to essences, mental entities and other forms of idealism which were accepted as a matter of fact in [[continental philosophy]] at the turn of the preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its uncritical use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. [[Abstraction]] is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives [[essence]]s, but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.

==Terminology==
The term "Family resemblance" as feature of Wittgenstein's philosophy owes much to its translation in English. Wittgenstein, who wrote mostly in German, used the compound word 'Familienähnlichkeit', but as he lectured and conversed in English he used 'family likeness' (e.g. ''The Blue Book'', p.&amp;nbsp;17,33; ''The Brown Book'',§66). However, in the ''Philosophical Investigations'' the separate word 'Ähnlichkeit' has been translated as 'similarity' (§§11,130,185,444) and on two occasions (§§9,90) it is given as 'like'.  The German family-word is common and it is found in [[Deutsches Wörterbuch|Grimm's dictionary]]; a rare occurrence of 'family likeness' has been noted in a lecture by [[John Fletcher Moulton|J. F. Moulton]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;see Griffin, N.: 1974, ''Wittgenstein, Universals and Family Resemblance'', Canadian Journal of Philosophy III,635–651&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and quotes==
Games are the main example considered by Wittgenstein in his text where he also mentions numbers and makes an analogy with a thread. He develops his argument further by insisting that in such cases there is not a clear cut boundary but there arises some ambiguity if this indefiniteness can be separated from the main point.
In §66 Wittgenstein invites us to {{quote|consider for example the proceedings that we call "games"...[to] look and see whether there is anything common to all.}}
The section mentions card games, board games, ball games, games like ring-a-ring-a-roses and concludes:
{{quote|And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; we can see how similarities crop up and disappear.
And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of
similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities.}}
The following §67 begins by stating:
{{quote|I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than "'''family resemblances'''"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. – And I shall say: "games" form a family.}}
and extends the illustration
{{quote|for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way. Why do we call something a "number"? Well, perhaps because it has a direct relationship with several things that have hitherto been called number; and this can be said to give it an indirect relationship to other things we call the same name. And we extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the thread does not reside in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the overlapping of many fibres.}}
The problem of boundaries  begins in §68
{{quote|I can give the concept 'number' rigid limits ... that is, use the word "number" for a rigidly limited concept, but I can also use it so that the extension of the concept is not closed by a frontier. And this is how we do use the word "game". For how is the concept of a game bounded? What still counts as a game and what no longer does? Can you give the boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that never troubled you before when you used the word  "game".)}}

==Formal models==
There are some simple [[Scientific modelling|model]]s&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham R., 1975, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/65935/Rodney-Needham-Polythetic-Classification-Convergence-and-Consequence ''Polythetic classification: Convergence and consequences''], Man 10 (1975) 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersen H.,:2000, ''Kuhn's account of family resemblance'', Erkenntnis 52: 313–337&lt;/ref&gt;
which can be derived from the text of §66-9. The most simple one, which fits Wittgenstein's exposition, seems to be the [[sorites paradox|sorites]] type. It consists in a collection of items ''Item_1'', ''Item_2'', ''Item_3''... described by features A, B, C, D, ...:

''Item_1'': A B C D               &lt;br&gt;
''Item_2'':   B C D E             &lt;br&gt;
''Item_3'':     C D E F         &lt;br&gt;
''Item_4'':       D E F G        &lt;br&gt;
''Item_5'':         E F G H      &lt;br&gt;
.........             . . . .

In this example, which presents an indefinitely extended ordered family, resemblance is seen in shared features: each item shares three features with his neighbors e.g. ''Item_2'' is like ''Item_1'' in respects B, C, D, and like ''Item_3'' in respects C, D, E. Obviously what we call 'resemblance' involves different aspects in each particular case. It is also seen to be of a different 'degree' and here it fades with 'distance': ''Item_1'' and ''Item_5'' have nothing in common.

Another simple model is described as:

''Item_1'': A B C   &lt;br&gt;
''Item_2'':   B C D &lt;br&gt;
''Item_3'': A   C D &lt;br&gt;
''Item_4'': A B   D &lt;br&gt;
It exhibits the presence of a constant degree of resemblance and the
absence of a common feature without extending to infinity.

Wittgenstein rejects the [[disjunction]] of features or 'properties', i.e. the set {A,B,C,D,..}, as something shared by all items. He admits that a 'sharing' is common to all but deems that it is only verbal:
{{quote|if someone wished to say: "There is something common to all these constructions – namely the disjunction of all their common properties" – I should reply: Now you are only playing with words. One might as well say: "Something runs through the whole thread – namely the continuous overlapping of those fibres".}}

==Notable applications==
*[[Thomas Kuhn]] uses  Wittgenstein's concept in chapter V ('The Priority of Paradigms) of his famous [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962). [[Paradigm]]s are not reducible to single discoverable sets of scientific rules, but consist of assumptions that relate to other rules that are recognized by parts of a scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T. (2012) 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions', p. 45. Fourth (Anniversary) Edition,  Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Morris Weitz]] first applied family resemblances in an attempt to describe [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Weitz M., ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics'', Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 15:1 (1956): pp. 27-35.&lt;/ref&gt; which opened a still{{When|date = September 2015}} continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman D., ''Family resemblances Relationism and the meaning of "art",'' British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 47, No. 3, July 2007 {{doi|10.1093/aesthj/aym008}} {{cite web |url=http://www.missouristate.edu/assets/phi/Family_Resemblances_Relationalism_and_the_Meaning_of_Art.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100436/http://www.missouristate.edu/assets/phi/Family_Resemblances_Relationalism_and_the_Meaning_of_Art.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Umberto Eco]] argued that while regimes may differ wildly in their particulars, manifestations of [[fascism]] can be recognized by a kind of family resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Eco U., 'Ur-Fascism,' New York Review of Books, vol. 42, No. 11, June 22, 1995  {{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/ |title=Ur-Fascism |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Renford Bambrough]] proposed that 'Wittgenstein solved what is known as "the [[problem of universals]]"' and said of his solution (as Hume said of Berkeley's treatment of the same topic) that it is "one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of letters".&lt;ref name="Bambrough"&gt;Bambrough, R.: 1961, ''Universals and Family Resemblance'', Proc. Aris. Soc. 61, 207–22&lt;/ref&gt; His view provided the occasion for numerous further comments.&lt;ref&gt;a recent summary in Blair D. (2006), ''Wittgenstein, Language and Information'', p.118 (note 117); see  also Dilman, I.: ''Universals: Bambrough on Wittgenstein'',  Aris. Soc. Proc., 79 (1978): 35–58; reprinted in John V. Canfi  ed., ''The Philosophy of Wittgenstein'', Vol. 5, Method and Essence, pp. 305–328. New York: Garland Publishing, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rodney Needham]] explored family resemblances in connection with the problem of [[Political alliance|alliance]] and noted their presence in taxonomy where they are known as a polythetic classification.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

== Game studies ==
Wittgenstein's suggestion (PI, §66) about the impossibility of formulating a definition of games portrays a predicament for disciplines, which entail games as their subject matter, because it denies the possibility to know what games are. One possible solution is to point out that Wittgenstein merely acts out his failing attempt to define the concept of game, because he wanted to demonstrate a mechanism of language. He wasn't particularly concerned about games, nor about the concept of 'game', but he was interested in the consequence of a definitory failure. The demonstration aims to show, that there is no reason to search for real definitions, which describe essential attributes of things, but rather nominal definitions, which describe the use of the term in a community. He connected this idea to language games – lingual expressions combined with action – as a more adequate alternative to explain the function of language. Confusing this is his choice to denominate the approach (PI, §7) as 'language games', further fueling the impression that he provides insights about the concept of game. Wittgenstein wasn't interested in games but in language, therefore his theories and examples are only superficially related to academic disciplines with games as subject matter.

==Criticism and comments==

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' is the primary text used in discussing family resemblances, even though the topic appears also in other works by Wittgenstein, notably [[Blue and Brown Books|''The Brown Book'']].&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein
L., ''The Blue and Brown Books'', London: Blackwell (1958);I 68, 17, 73&lt;/ref&gt; Many contributions to the discussion are by people involved in philosophical research but concerned with more pragmatic questions such as taxonomy&lt;ref name="Winsor"/&gt; or information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Blair D., Wittgenstein, Language and Information, Berlin:Springer, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Sluga]] has observed that "the notion of family resemblance... draws on two quite different sets of ideas, two different vocabularies, but treats them as if they were one and the same. The first is the vocabulary of kinship, of descent, of some sort of real and causal connection.. the second is that of similarity, resemblance, affinity and correspondence."&lt;ref&gt;Sluga H., Family Resemlance, ''Grazer Philosophische Studien'' 71 (2006) 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus for criticism is{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} the notion of similarity, which is instrumental for family resemblance. A similarity is always found for two arbitrarily selected objects, or a series of intermediaries can link them into a family. This problem has been known as underdeterminacy or open ended texture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Admittedly infinity is only potential {{clarify|date=December 2015}} but for any finite family some common element can be pointed out, especially if relational properties are taken into consideration. {{Examples|date=December 2015}}
Wittgenstein's insistence that boundaries do not really exist but can
be traced arbitrarily has been described as [[conventionalism]] and more generally the acceptance of his conception has been seen to present a refined [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Resemblance Nominalism.

The '''Hanyangdoseong''' ([[Hangul]]: 한양도성; [[Hanja]]: 漢陽都城), or literally the '''Seoul City Wall''' is a series of [[wall]]s made of stone, wood and other materials, built to protect the city of [[Seoul]] against invaders. The wall was first built in 1396 to defend and show the boundaries of the city, surrounding [[Seoul|Hanyang]] (hangul: 한양; hanja: 漢陽; the old name for [[Seoul]]) in the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. At that time, it was called ''Hansung'' (hangul: 한성; hanja: 漢城). The wall stretches 18.6&amp;nbsp;km along the ridge of Seoul's four inner mountains, Baegaksan, Naksan, Namsan, and Inwangsan. At present, a 12-km section of the wall is designated as Historic Site No. 10 (1963) and is protected accordingly, along with the gates, water gates, and signal fire mounds. The northern, eastern, and southern sections of Mt.Nam (Namsan section) walls have undergone extensive restoration work, having sustained damage or been entirely destroyed during Japanese imperial rule (1910-1945).

==Castellation==
In 1395, just five years after King [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]] founded the Joseon Dynasty, King [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]] established a government office [''Doseongchukjoedogam'' (hangul: 도성축조도감; hanja: 都城築造都監)] to build a castle to defend Seoul. He ordered [[Jeong Do-jeon]] to search for and measure a site.

On January 1, 1396 (by the lunar calendar), Taejo of Joseon held the groundbreaking ceremony. 197,400 young men were placed under [[civil conscription]] over two years and completed building the castle 98 days after the war along the mountains [[Bugaksan]], [[Naksan]], [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]], and [[Inwangsan]]. The wall contained [[The Eight Gates of Seoul|eight gates]], all of which were originally constructed between 1396 and 1398.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:KOCIS Korea Seoul Fortress 20130924 07 (9911038604).jpg|thumb|right|Hanyangdoseong at City Wall Park &amp; Naksan Park, Seoul]]
The original walls, built in the late 14th century were constructed of medium-sized round stones held together by mud. During King [[Sejong]] the Great’s reign in the mid 15th century, a large-scale refurbishment work was carried out on the wall, including the replacement of earthen wall sections with rectangular stone sections.&lt;ref name=" Seoul City Wall "/&gt; A major restoration in 1704 by King [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]] rebuilt sections of the wall using large, uniform stone slabs which mark the final and last unique characteristic of Hanyangdoseong.&lt;ref name=" Hiking Hanyangdoseong"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hiking Hanyangdoseong |last= Discovering Korea |work= Discovering Korea |publisher= Discovering Korea |date= 2014-07-30 |url= http://discoveringkorea.com/100914/hiking-seoul-fortress/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140810160827/http://discoveringkorea.com/100914/hiking-seoul-fortress/ |archivedate= 2014-08-10 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern section of Seoul was on lower ground than the other sections and was more susceptible to external attack. Thus, a [[lookout]] was added to the outside of the gate to reinforce its defense. A part of the walls in the section between Heunginjimun and Gwanghuimun was extended outside in a rectangular shape for such a purpose. [[Signal fire mounds]], another component of the defense system, were first established in 1394 and remained in operation until 1894. Signals sent across the country from one mound to another, using smoke by day and fire at night, were received by the beacon at the top of [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]] and conveyed to the Royal Palace.

==Gates==
[[Image:Sungnyemun_Gate,_front,_2013.jpg|thumb|right|Sungnyemun Gate, Seoul]]
Four main gates and four auxiliary gates were built around Seoul in the late 14th century. The four main gates were [[Heunginjimun]] (East Gate), [[Donuimun]] (West Gate), [[Sungnyemun]] (South Gate), and [[Sukjeongmun]] (North Gate). The four auxiliary gates were placed in areas between the four main gates, with [[Souimun]] (in the southwest), [[Changuimun]] (in the northwest), [[Hyehwamun]] (in the northeast), and [[Gwanghuimun]] (in the southeast). 

At present, the following gates are either preserved in their original form or have undergone restoration work: Sungnyemun (South Gate) and Heunginjimun (East Gate) are designated as National Treasure No. 1 and Treasure No. 1, respectively.&lt;ref name=" Seoul City Wall "/&gt;

==Condition==
[[Image:KOCIS Korea Seoul Fortress 20130924 19 (9910949355).jpg|thumb|right|Hanyangdoseong, which shows restoration efforts made by the Seoul government]]
Hanyangdoseong, completed in 30 years, was torn down in many parts due to city planning initiatives and the introduction of trams lines. However, significant sections of the wall remain. The best-preserved and well-known course is the Wall of Mt. Bukaksan, the 2.3-kilometer trail which cuts through Sukjeongmun to Changuimun. Previously off-limits to the public after having been designated as a Military Reserve area due to its close proximity to Cheongwadae, it opened to the public in 2006. With very few alterations or artificial structures surrounding the area over the years, the natural environment remains relatively intact.&lt;ref name=" Hiking trip along the Wall"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hiking trip along the Wall |last=Visit Korea |work=Visit Korea|publisher=Visit Korea |date=2014-07-30 |url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Travel/view?articleId=99898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
George van Driem has conducted field research in the Himalayas since 1983. He was commissioned by the Royal Government of [[Bhutan]] to codify a grammar of [[Dzongkha]], the national language, design a phonological romanisation for the language known as Roman Dzongkha, and complete a survey of the language communities of the kingdom. He and native Dzongkha speaker Karma Tshering co-authored the authoritative textbook on Dzongkha. Van Driem wrote grammars of [[Limbu language|Limbu]] and [[Dumi language|Dumi]], Kiranti languages spoken in eastern Nepal, and the [[Bumthang language|Bumthang]] language of central Bhutan. He authored ''Languages of the Himalayas,'' a two-volume ethnolinguistic handbook of the greater Himalayan region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/ |title='&amp;#39;Languages of the Himalayas'&amp;#39; |publisher=Brill.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a programme named ''Languages and Genes of the Greater Himalayan Region'', conducted in collaboration with the Government of Nepal and the Royal Government of Bhutan, he collected DNA from many indigenous peoples of the Himalayas.

In Bern, George van Driem currently runs the research programme Strategische Zielsetzungen im Subkontinent (Strategic Objectives in the Subcontinent),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayanlanguages.org/ |title=Strategische Zielsetzungen im Subkontinent |publisher=Himalayanlanguages.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to analyse and describe endangered and poorly documented languages in South Asia. This programme of research is effectively a diversification of the Himalayan Languages Project, which he directed at Leiden University, where he held the chair of Descriptive Linguistics until 2009. He and his research team have documented over a dozen endangered languages of the greater Himalayan region, producing analytical grammars and lexica and recording morphologically analysed native texts. 

His interdisciplinary research in collaboration with geneticists has led to advances in the reconstruction of Asian ethnolinguistic prehistory. Based on linguistic palaeontology, ethnolinguistic phylogeography, rice genetics and the Holocene distribution of faunal species, he identified the ancient Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatics as the first domesticators of Asian rice and published a theory on the homelands and prehistoric dispersal of the [[Hmong-Mien]], [[Austroasiatic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Trans-Himalayan]] linguistic phyla. His historical linguistic work on linguistic phylogeny has replaced the unsupported Sino-Tibetan hypothesis with the older, more agnostic Tibeto-Burman phylogenetic model, for which he proposed the neutral geographical name Trans-Himalayan in 2004. He developed the Darwinian theory of language known as [[Symbiosism]], and he is author of the philosophy of Symbiomism.

'''''God Nose''''' is a 42-page American [[comic book]] produced in 1964 by [[Jaxon|Jack "Jaxon" Jackson]] and is considered one of the first [[underground comix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2010-03-12/977251/ SXSW Film - Letting the Freak Brothers Flag Fly: Gilbert Shelton on his iconic comic's long, strange trip to the screen - Screens - The Austin Chronicle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2011-03-18/esthers-follies/ Esther's Follies: After 30 years, Awn is off - Arts - The Austin Chronicle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2006-12-22/431062/ The Comics (Artist) Panel: Five Austinites on the state of the sequential art, from comics to comix to manga and beyond - Arts - The Austin Chronicle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''God Nose'' centers on philosophical discussions between God and the "fools he rules."&lt;ref&gt;Booke, Keith M. 2010, ''Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels'', ABC-CLIO, LLC, Santa Barbara, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
''God Nose'' portrays God as an old man with a white beard and a crown, sitting on a golden throne in Heaven. He and [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] discuss modern life, including such controversial topics as [[birth control]] and racism. At one point, Jesus returns to Earth to be a [[folk singer]]. (He also tries [[surfing]].) God also visits Earth, at one point materializing into the bedroom of a couple as they are about to make love.

== Publication history ==
Jaxon's ''God Nose'' strip first appeared in the Florida college fanzine ''Charlatan'', where it was published from 1963 to at least 1966.

In 1964, Jaxon collected a number of the previous strips, and printed 1,000 copies on a [[Xerox]] machine at the Texas State Capital print shop after hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtJlJK7p5A&amp;feature=plcp TEDxCMU - Zach Weiner - The Fall and Rise of the American Comic Strip - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=826&amp;lotNo=42140 God Nose #1 (Jack Jackson, 1964) Condition: VF Silver Age (1956-1969)Alternative/Underground&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/j/jackson.htm "Comic creator: Jack Jackson (Jaxon),"] Lambiek ''Comiclopedia''.

[http://comixjoint.com/godnose-2nd.html "God Nose,"] ComixJoint. Accessed Dec. 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rip Off Press]], an underground publisher co-founded by Jaxon, did a second printing in 1969, with a revised cover lacking a cover price and with a pink border with red central color. The third printing, also by Rip Off Press, has a blue border with green central color and a 50c price below the basketball hoop. Rip Off Press did a fourth and final printing in 1971; it has a red border with yellow central color and a 50c cover price. The second-fourth printings are standard comic book size, 44 pages long.&lt;ref name=ComixJoint /&gt;

The entirety of ''God Nose'' was also reprinted as ''Underground Classics'' (Rip Off Press, 1985 series) #6 (1988).

==Biography==
Grandin graduated from [[Brooklyn College]] with a B.A. (1992) and from [[Yale University]] with a Ph.D. (1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://history.fas.nyu.edu/object/history.faculty.grandin.interests&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the [[Latin American Studies Association]]'s Bryce Wood Award for the best book published in any discipline on [[Latin America]] for ''Blood of Guatemala: A History of Race and Nation''.
[[Eric Hobsbawm]] called ''The Last Colonial Massacre'' a "remarkable and extremely well-written work" that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;is about more than the dark history of Guatemala and the Cold War in Latin America. It is about how common people discover politics. It is about the roots of democracy and those of genocide. It is about the hopes and defeats of the twentieth-century left. I could not put this book down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/305724in.html |title=Interview with Greg Grandin author of The Last Colonial Massacre: Latin America in the Cold War |publisher=Press.uchicago.edu |date=May 29, 1978 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hercules and Antaeus''' is an early 16th-century bronze sculpture by [[Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi|Pier Jacopo di Antonio Alari-Bonacolsi]]. The [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga family]] court sculptor based this group on a classical marble of Hercules and Antaeus which is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti Palace]] in [[Florence]]. The statue was given to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Dr. W. L. Hildburgh, F. S.

"'''Holidays of Future Passed'''" is the ninth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 11, 2011. Most of the episode is set thirty years into the future, when [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] take their children with them to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s house over Christmas, while a pregnant [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] goes into labor. Bart has divorced his wife Jenda and is struggling to become a better father for his two boys, while Lisa has trouble connecting with her rebellious teenage daughter Zia. ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] made a minor uncredited cameo appearance as a [[sports commentator]] shouting "goal!" during a [[Association football|soccer]] game.

Originally written as a potential [[series finale]], the episode has received highly positive reception from television critics who often cited it as the best episode of the season. It has been particularly praised for its humor and for its emotional scenes, such as one where Bart and Lisa sit in their old [[treehouse]] and talk about how difficult parenting is. During the original broadcast, "Holidays of Future Passed" was watched by about 6.43 million people. Since then, it has garnered attention in the media for a segment taking place thirty years in the future in which it is implied that the city of [[Dearborn, Michigan]] is "still under [[sharia law]]". Commentators have had mixed opinions on what the segment is mocking, whether it is the increasing Islamic influence in the US, specifically in  Dearborn, or rather those who are thinking that Dearborn is under sharia law in December 2011, the time that the episode aired.

==Plot==
After stuffing themselves with turkey on [[Thanksgiving]], it is time to take the annual [[Christmas card]] family photo, and when [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] complain about it, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] notes that they will grow to appreciate the photos when they become older and have children of their own. Lisa questions why Marge would assume they will even have children in the first place while Bart confidently claims that he won't, desiring for the Simpson family's legacy of dysfunction to cease. The episode jumps thirty years into the future via a series of Simpsons Christmas cards. The photos finally settle on a future where Bart is a deadbeat, divorced father with two sons whom he does not see often; Lisa is a successful businesswoman who is married to [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and has a rebellious daughter named Zia; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] is the lead singer of a famous band and in the late stages of pregnancy. In his apartment at the former [[Springfield Elementary]], Bart is visited by his sons, who inform him that their mother [[Future-Drama|Jenda]] teleported them to his place because she wants him to act like a proper father by having him spend time with them. However, he plans on dropping them off at his parents' house instead. Meanwhile, Lisa fears that Zia is spending too much of her time going into the "Ultranet", a digital world that people enter with their consciousness by plugging themselves into a laptop. Milhouse suggests to Lisa that she spend time with Zia in order for them to have a better connection, so Lisa decides to take Zia to her parents' house, too. Meanwhile, Maggie flies home from London to Springfield to also celebrate Christmas with her parents.

When Bart and Lisa arrive at their parents' home, they stay there  with their children. Unfortunately for Lisa, she only gets unhelpful advice from Marge on how to be a better mother and Zia continues to go into the Ultranet. Meanwhile, Bart is heartbroken to find out that Jenda has remarried while he has not found anyone new. Feeling depressed, he tells [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to take his grandsons out. The boys become angry with their father for not spending time with them, but the two have a great time with their grandfather. Bart and Lisa then encounter each other in their old treehouse, where they become slightly [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and talk about how difficult parenting is. After exchanging inspirational advice, they realize that they need to try harder to connect with their children. Meanwhile, upon arriving in Springfield, Maggie starts experiencing contractions and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], now a taxi driver, drives her to the hospital.

Homer takes Bart's sons to a [[cryonics]] facility where [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]] has been frozen alive to prevent a disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them  in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world. Entering it, Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next to a series of posters depicting historical women who have made a difference in the world. When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl. The Simpsons gather into a group just as the family pets (who have evolved greatly over the past thirty years) take the new photo.

''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] made a minor cameo in the episode, though his appearance is not mentioned in the [[closing credits]].&lt;ref name=Ledesma/&gt; In the episode, a robot examines the health of Maggie's fetus. Maggie's band is present, and one of the band members presses a button on the robot's "face", which is a screen showing its facial expressions, and a soccer game comes on instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Holidays of Future Passed  |episodelink= |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= |network=Fox |station= |airdate=2011-12-11 |season=23|seriesno= |number=9 |minutes=04:57–05:20 |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sports commentator, voiced by Groening, gives a long "goal!" shout that is heard over the game. According to ''The Simpsons'' music editor Chris Ledesma, as the episode was being recorded, "there were only sounds of crowd cheering during that shot and Matt said we needed to spice it up somehow."&lt;ref name=Ledesma/&gt; After going through some different ideas, the staff settled on a commentator shouting "goal!".

In a 2013 interview with former show writer [[Conan O'Brien]], Jean stated that this episode was intended to serve as a [[series finale]] in the case that cast negotiations earlier in the year forced the show to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Anna|title='Simpsons' series finale?

===Critical reviews===
Since airing, "Holidays of Future Passed" has received highly positive reviews from television critics, particularly for its humor and emotional scenes. In his list of "The 50 Best TV Episodes of 2011", [[BuddyTV]]'s John Kubicek placed the episode at number forty-nine, writing that the "various glimpses of how all the other characters have changed during the time jump was a cavalcade of comedy moments."&lt;ref name=Kubicek&gt;{{cite web|last=Kubicek|first=John|title=The 50 Best TV Episodes of 2011|url=http://www.buddytv.com/slideshows/friday-night-lights/the-50-best-tv-episodes-of-2011-5525.aspx|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|accessdate=2011-12-20|date=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rex Huffman of ''[[GateHouse Media|The Times-Reporter]]'' cited it as "an amusing episode",&lt;ref name=Huffman&gt;{{cite news|last=Huffman |first=Rex |title='Christmas in Connecticut,' 'Battle of the Bulbs' on tap tonight |url=http://www.timesreporter.com/newsnow/x230572099/Christmas-in-Connecticut-Battle-of-the-Bulbs-on-tap-tonight |accessdate=2011-12-16 |newspaper=[[GateHouse Media|The Times-Reporter]] |date=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108022038/http://www.timesreporter.com/newsnow/x230572099/Christmas-in-Connecticut-Battle-of-the-Bulbs-on-tap-tonight |archivedate=2012-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ology (website)|Ology]]'s Josh Harrison described it as "legitimately funny".&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt; Harrison noted that "seeing so many futuristic versions of familiar characters put an interesting spin on the holiday season."&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt; He also commented: "The whole episode hinges on a surprisingly heartfelt scene that sees Bart and Lisa—both a bit sloshed—meeting up in the treehouse to discuss the challenges of parenting."&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison |first=Josh |title='The Simpsons' Recap: 'Holidays Of Future Passed' |url=http://www.ology.com/tv/simpsons-recap-holidays-future-passed/12112011 |publisher=[[Ology (website)|Ology]] |accessdate=2011-12-12 |date=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108010157/http://www.ology.com/tv/simpsons-recap-holidays-future-passed/12112011 |archivedate=2012-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that "Holidays of Future Passed" found "a sweet spot that combined a barrage of non-stop jokes with a tenderness often lacking in latter-day ''Simpsons'' episodes. There is even a conversation between the adult Bart and Lisa that rings surprisingly true for adult siblings wrestling with their shared familial past."&lt;ref name="Childs"/&gt;

Writing for [[HitFix]], [[Alan Sepinwall]] cited "Holidays of Future Passed" as the best future-set episode of ''The Simpsons'' since the first one, "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was "the emotional side of things" that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age."&lt;ref name=Sepinwall/&gt; Sepinwall particularly praised the scene at the cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [Grampa] because he's such a pain in the ass."&lt;ref name=Sepinwall/&gt; Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] as "the [[Andy Rooney]] of 2041" and [[Ralph Wiggum]] as "an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another."&lt;ref name=Sepinwall&gt;{{cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Review: 'The Simpsons' - 'Holidays of Future Passed': The darkest timeline?|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/the-simpsons-holidays-of-future-passed-the-darkest-timeline|publisher=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=2011-12-16|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, "Holidays of Future Passed" was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine as one of "Nine Latter-Day ''Simpsons'' Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics". He noted that the "reconciliations between Bart and Lisa and their kids are moving."&lt;ref name=vulture&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/02/nine-simpsons-episodes-as-good-as-early-classics.html|title=Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2012-02-10|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2012, "Holidays of Future Passed" was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/simpsons|title=The Simpsons|work=Emmys.com|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to Islamic references===
[[File:Arab American National Museum.jpg|thumb|A scene portraying [[Dearborn, Michigan]] as under [[sharia law]] received a mixed reception in the city]]
A segment of "Holidays of Future Passed" was inspired by a controversy over the growing Islamic influence in the city of [[Dearborn, Michigan]], which has "a significant Muslim community".&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; The biggest [[mosque]] in the United States is also located there.&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Bill |title='Simpsons' Episode References Dearborn |url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/simpsons-episode-references-dearborn-20111212-ms |accessdate=2011-12-17 |newspaper=''[[WJBK]]'' |date=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410194355/http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/simpsons-episode-references-dearborn-20111212-ms |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the segment in question, set in Milhouse and Lisa's future home, Milhouse tells Lisa that he has started to feel the symptoms of his seasonal allergies now that Christmas has arrived. He is apparently allergic to Christmas-related things such as [[holly]], [[mistletoe]], and the red part of [[candy cane]]. Lisa advises Milhouse to go and stay in [[Michigan]] over the holidays, where Christmas is not celebrated because it is "still under [[sharia law]]."&lt;ref name="dearbornscene"/&gt; Milhouse agrees to do this, but complains that they always make him wear a veil there, pointing to a photo on the wall in which he is standing outside of the [[University of Michigan–Dearborn]] dressed in a [[burqa]].&lt;ref name="dearbornscene"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Holidays of Future Passed  |episodelink= |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= |network=Fox |station= |airdate=2011-12-11 |season=23|seriesno= |number=9 |minutes=03:46–04:48 |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Simpsons’ episode spoofs fear of Sharia law|url=http://downriversundaytimes.com/2011/12/17/%E2%80%98simpsons%E2%80%99-episode-spoofs-fear-of-sharia-law/|accessdate=11-12-18|newspaper=Dearborn Times-Herald|date=11-12-17|author=Heraty, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shellnutt&gt;{{cite news|last=Shellnutt|first=Kate|title=The Simpsons holiday episode mocks shariah law in the U.S.|url=http://blog.chron.com/believeitornot/2011/12/the-simpsons-holiday-episode-mocks-shariah-law-in-the-u-s/|accessdate=2011-12-17|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news report about this segment that aired on WJBK, Gallagher noted that it "poked fun at the untrue and unfounded notion that somehow Muslim sharia law prevails in Dearborn."&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; Dawud Walid, head of the Michigan branch of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], commented in the report that ''The Simpsons'' "is a very prolific show. Now [it] is addressing this anti-sharia fear mongering issue, and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it."&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: "It's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate is. I think it's pretty funny," while another noted: "I don't think it's a good thing [to mock anti-Islamic bigotry] because we can change it by talking, not making fun."&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt;

'''Holy Trinity Church, Dalston''', also known as the '''Clowns’ Church''' is a [[Church of England]] parish church in Beechwood Road in the borough of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], north [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Attraction/Holy_Trinity,_The_Clowns_Church/0c6d/ |title=Holy Trinity, The Clowns' Church in London &amp;#124; Nearby hotels, shops and restaurants |publisher=LondonTown.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in the parish of Holy Trinity with St Philip Dalston and [[All Saints Church, Haggerston]] (St Philip having been bombed during the [[World War II|war]] and demolished some time between 1947 and 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22712 |title=Hackney - List of Churches &amp;#124; A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10 (pp. 122-128) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=1977-03-15 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 2014, the vicar was [[Rose Hudson-Wilkin]], who also holds the roles of [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]’s chaplain to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], priest vicar at [[Westminster Abbey]] and chaplain to the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/the-church-in-parliament/speaker%27s-chaplain/revd-rose-hudson-wilkin.aspx |title=Revd Rose Hudson-Wilkin |publisher=Churchofengland.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/22/rev-rose-hudson-wilkin-church-sex_n_2350729.html |title=Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, First Black Female Chaplain To Queen Hits Out Over Women Bishops, Gay Marriage |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2012-12-22 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design==
Holy Trinity was designed by [[Ewan Christian]] – a noted church builder and restorer and architect of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Goold |url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=203623 |title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (January 19, 2014, 3:13 pm) |publisher=Scottisharchitects.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main phase of construction took place in 1878-79 and was funded from the proceeds of the sale of [[St Martin Outwich]] in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="britishlistedbuildings1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-426309-holy-trinity-greater-london-authority |title=Holy Trinity - Hackney - Greater London - England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[Listed building|Grade II]]-listed building; its 1975 designation noted both the reputation of its architect and its impressive [[High Victorian Gothic|High Victorian]] style with continental influences.&lt;ref name="britishlistedbuildings1"/&gt;

It is constructed in red brick in the [[English Gothic architecture|Early English style]] and has a slate roof. Inside Holy Trinity is a screen brought from St Philip, Dalston after that church was damaged by bombing in December 1940. The post-war east window of the church has glass by A. F. Erridge.&lt;ref name="britishlistedbuildings1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-p79phi&amp;cid=-1#-1 |title=Access to Archives |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Clowns' Church==
Holy Trinity is known as the Clowns’ Church for the annual [[Clowns International]] service held on the first Sunday in February in honour of [[Joseph Grimaldi]] and deceased clowns. The service was established in 1946/7 at St James’s Episcopal Chapel in Pentonville Road, where Grimaldi is buried (now Joseph Grimaldi Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=ISL043 |title=London Gardens Online |publisher=London Gardens Online |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moved to Holy Trinity in 1959 after St James's was deconsecrated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dangerfield |first=Andy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21319024 |title=BBC News - Clowns in Joseph Grimaldi church tribute service |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Clowns-international.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=They’re having a laugh: Grimaldi Clown Church Service |url=http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2013/02/01/theyre-having-a-laugh-grimaldi-clown-church-service/ |title=They’re having a laugh: Grimaldi Clown Church Service – Now.

This. – Time Out London |publisher=Now-here-this.timeout.com |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is attended by clowns in full costume and is usually followed by a performance for members of the public.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The vestry of Holy Trinity Church is home to the [[Clowns Gallery-Museum]], which includes the Clown Egg Register.

[[Image:Dama de Elche (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|250px|''Lady of Elche'']]

The '''''Lady of Elche''''' or '''''Lady of Elx''''' (in Spanish, '''''Dama de Elche''''')  is a [[limestone]]&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Misterios sin aclarar de la Dama de Elche|url=http://www.abc.es/historia/abci-misterios-sin-aclarar-dama-elche-201608041257_noticia.html|work=[[ABC (Spain)]]|date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] that was discovered in 1897 at ''L'Alcúdia,'' an archaeological site on a private estate two kilometers south of [[Elche]], [[Spain]]. It is currently exhibited in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in Madrid.

It is generally known as an [[Iberians|Iberian]] artifact from the 4th century BC, although the artisanship suggests strong Hellenistic influences.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Vives Boix, ''La Dama de Elche en el año 2000 : Análisis tecnológico y artístico'' [http://dama.esy.es/Dama2000/Bienvenida.html].&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', the ''Lady of Elche'' is believed to have a direct association with [[Tanit]], the goddess of Carthage, who was worshiped by the [[Carthaginian Iberia|Punic-Iberians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan Library Ref. USA - Iberian Religion - page 549&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sculpture==
{{Main|Iberian sculpture}}

The originally [[polychrome]]d bust is thought to represent a woman wearing an elaborate [[headdress]] and large wheel-like coils (known as ''rodetes'') on each side of the face. The opening in the rear of the sculpture indicates it may have been used as a [[funerary urn]].
[[Image:DamaElche01.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Detail of the Lady of Elche]]

Other artifacts associated with Iberian culture are the ''[[Lady of Guardamar]]'' −which has similar wheel-like rodetes and necklaces− or the ''[[Lady of Baza]]''. While the ''Lady of Elche'' is a bust, there are indications that it was part of a seated statue, similar to the ''Lady of Baza'' (with which it shares similar necklance pendants) or a standing one like the ''[[Gran Dama Oferente]]'' from Cerro de los Santos ([[Montealegre del Castillo]], [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]]).

These three figures and the ''[[Bicha of Balazote]]'' are exhibited in the same Iberian art hall in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in Madrid.

==Discovery and repatriation==
[[Image:Dama de Elche colores2007.jpg|150px|thumb|Color reconstruction by Francisco Vives]]
The sculpture was found on 4 August 1897, by a young worker, Manuel Campello Esclapez. The popular version of the story differs from the official report by Pere Ibarra (the local keeper of the records) which stated that Antonio Maciá found the bust. Ibarra's version of the discovery story, was that farm workers clearing the southeast slope of [[archaeological site of La Alcudia|La Alcudia]] for agricultural purposes, discovered the sculpture. The bust was quickly nicknamed "''Reina Mora''" or "[[Moors|Moorish]] Queen" by locals.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

An archaeological site is now located where the bust of Elche was discovered. Evidence has been found there of an Iberian-Punic settlement, a Roman sewer, walls and Roman houses, and mosaics. One mosaic shows an effigy of [[Abdon and Sennen|Saint Abdon]], belonging to a Christian [[basilica]] of the 5th century. The latter archaeological evidence is supported by the [[codex|codices]] of the councils of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] where it discusses an audience with bishops from ''Illici'' (Elche).

Dr. Campello, owner of the farm, was married to Asunción Ibarra, daughter of [[Aureliano Ibarra Manzoni]], a [[Humanism|humanist]] from the 19th century whose hobby was [[archeology]]. Ibarra Manzoni had found a number of objects and Iberian vestiges on his own farmland and in other places in the municipality of Elche. He built up a valuable collection, which he bequeathed to his daughter Asunción. He provided instructions that she make the necessary arrangements for the collection to be offered for sale to the [[Real Academia de la Historia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; after her death, to be located finally at the National Archaeological Museum. The will specified that the collection be sold in its entirety. The family placed the Lady on their balcony so that it could be viewed by all of the residents of Elche.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Don Pedro Ibarra invited French archaeologist [[Pierre Paris]] to his home to see the ''[[Mystery Play of Elche]]''. When the archaeologist saw the Iberian bust, he recognized its worth and notified the [[Louvre]] in Paris. The Louvre offered a large sum of money for the time: 4000 [[French franc|francs]], and purchased the sculpture within a few weeks of its discovery. Despite opposition from Doña Asuncion, the Iberian bust was sold. On 30 August 1897, the sculpture was sent to the Louvre.

For 40 years the ''Dama de Elche'' was exhibited at the Louvre. After the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, as a precaution, the sculpture was transferred for safe-keeping to the castle of [[Montauban]] near Toulouse.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; The [[Vichy government]] negotiated the statue's return to Spain with [[Francoist Spain|Franco's government]]. In 1941 it was returned through an exchange of works (which also included the [[The Immaculate of Soult|''Immaculate Conception of the Venerable Ones'']] (or ''Immaculate Conception of Soult'') by [[Bartolome Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], the twin sphinxes of [[El Salobral]] and several pieces of the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], and the Iberian sculptures of [[Osuna]]. In return Spain transferred to France a portrait of [[Mariana of Austria]] by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (the Prado kept another existing version of the portrait, which was considered of superior quality)&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; and a ''[[Portrait of Antonio de Covarrubias]]'' by [[El Greco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/index.php?id=763 |title=Encyclopedia of the Prado/Timeline museum/1941 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |author=Prado}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1941, the ''Lady of Elche'' has been officially owned by the [[Museo del Prado]] (catalog number E433).

The discovery of the ''Lady of Elche'' initiated a popular interest in pre-Roman Iberian culture. She appeared on a 1948 Spanish one-[[Spanish peseta|peseta]] banknote and was mentioned in [[William Gaddis]]'s ''The Recognitions'' (1955).

In 1971 it was transferred from El Prado to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/dama-de-elche-anonimo/|title=Enciclopedia On-Line/Dama de Elche (anonymous) |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |author=Prado Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is currently exhibited.

===Exhibitions in Elche===

In 1965 the ''Dama de Elche'' returned briefly to Elche, on the occasion of the seventh centenary of ''[[Mystery Play of Elche]]''.

On 19 January 2006, the Minister of Culture of Spain, [[Carmen Calvo]], issued a decision to temporarily lease the Lady to its hometown. From 18 May 2006, to 1 November 2006. the ''Dama de Elche'' presided over the inauguration of the Museum of Archaeology and History of Elche (in the [[Palacio de Altamira (Elche)|Palace of Altamira]]) and the exhibition From Ilici to Elx, 2500 Years of History that took place in different locations in the city. It was represented by an exact replica afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/47/-p-Facsimile-of-the-Dama-De-Elche--p- Facsimile of the Dama de Elche executed by Adam Lowe's studio Factum Arte in Madrid (2002-2005)] accessed 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitelche.com/turismo-cultural/visitas/elche/museos/museo-arqueologico-y-de-historia-de-elche-mahe/ Museo Arqueológico y de Historia de Elche (MAHE)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101220306/http://www.visitelche.com/turismo-cultural/visitas/elche/museos/museo-arqueologico-y-de-historia-de-elche-mahe/ |date=1 November 2014 }}, accessed 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contention of forgery==
The bust was first accused of being a forgery in 1906, in an essay called 'Las esculturas del Cerro de los Santos, cuestion de autenticidad' by archeologist [[José Ramón Mélida]].
[[File:Dama de Baza detail.jpg| ''Lady of Baza''|right|thumb|The [[Lady of Baza]], another Iberian "lady" bust.]]
In 1995, [[John F. Moffitt]], an art historian specializing in painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klowry.com/2008/06/jack-moffitt-1940-2008.html|title=Jack Moffitt, 1940-2008|work=klowry.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304135140/http://www.klowry.com/2008/06/jack-moffitt-1940-2008.html|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; published ''Art Forgery: The Case of the Lady of Elche'', [[University Press of Florida]], in which he contended that the statue was a [[archaeological forgery|forgery]] with similarities to [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist art]] of the [[Belle Époque]]. He speculated that the identity of the forger and commissioner was "a physician and resident surgeon in the town of Elche" who was "well informed about the current state of Iberian studies" and owned "the fertile archaeological site of La Alcúdia."

Experts in Spanish archaeology have rejected Moffitt's theory and accept the ''Lady of Elche'' as a genuine ancient Iberian work. Antonio Uriarte of the University of Madrid has stated: "Decade by decade, research has reinforced the coherence of the Lady within the corpus of Iberian sculpture. The Lady was found more than a century ago, and many of its features, not then understood, have been confirmed by subsequent finds. For example, the use of paint in Iberian sculpture was unknown when the Lady appeared."&lt;ref&gt;R. Olmos and T. Tortosa, in Gocha R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), ''Ancient Greeks West and East'', Leiden:  Brill, 1999, brief summary here [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-03-20.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC) study on the Lady of Elche's micropigmentation published in 2005 concluded that the trace pigments on the statue were consistent with ancient materials and that no modern pigments had been found.&lt;ref&gt;M. P. Luxán, J. L. Prada, F. Dorrego, 2005, "Dama de Elche: pigments, surface coating and stone of the sculpture", ''Materials and structures'', 38(277), pp. 419-424. [https://www.rilem.net/boutique/fiche.php?cat=journal&amp;reference=1645]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  See also [http://www.springerlink.com/content/g3867m6578u5v27p/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, María Pilar Luxán,&lt;ref&gt;Luxán, Mª P. ''et al'' (2011). Human bone ashes found in the ''Dama de Elche'' (5th-4th century B.C.) reveal its use as an ancient cinerary urn. ''Journal of Cultural Heritage vol. 12, issue 3, pp. 310-316.''&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the 2005 study, analyzed microparticles within the back hole of the ''Dama d'Elx'' utilizing [[Electron Microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray dispersive spectrometry]]. Luxán deduced that the particles belonged to the ashes of human bones and that they compared with those of the Iberian period. She concluded that the statue was used as a [[funeral urn|funerary urn]] in the Iberian period, thus guaranteeing its antiquity and confirming the hypothesis about its function.

==In modern culture==
French artist [[James Tissot]] based figures in several of his turn-of-the-century paintings on the recently discovered ''Lady of Elche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/image.asp?PubID=BSBR&amp;Volume=07&amp;Issue=04&amp;ImageID=02900&amp;SourcePage=publication.asp&amp;UserID=0&amp;|title=Picture - The BAS Library|work=bib-arch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jephthah’s Daughter by James Tissot.jpg|150px|thumb|''Jephthah's Daughter'' by James Tissot, based on the Lady of Elche.]]

The Dama de Elche makes an appearance in Part III of [[William Gaddis]]'s 1955 novel ''[[The Recognitions]]'', when the character Wyatt Gwyon examines a one peseta note and calls the engraving of the bust a "beautiful thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gaddis|first= William|date= 1985|orig-year= 1955|title= The Recognitions|url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Books|page= 782|isbn=978-0-14-007768-1 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">The [[Soviet Union]] actively tried to incorporate [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals into the study of [[linguistics]].

Linguists had important positions in the early Soviet state, as they were needed to develop alphabets for languages that previously had never been written.&lt;ref name=BrandistChown&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics and the Theory of Language in the USSR 1917–1938 |editor1=Craig Brandist  |editor2=Katya Chown |url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/anthem/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780857289483 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, language began to be seen as a social phenomenon, and Russian and Soviet linguists tried to give a sociological explanation to features of language. At the same time, Soviet linguists sought to develop a "Marxist" linguistics, as opposed to the early theories that were viewed as [[bourgeois]]. Based on this, linguists focused more on the spoken forms of the language, and devoted more time to the study of non-standard dialects than previous linguists had done. This can be seen in the work of [[Boris Alexandrovich Larin]] and [[Lev Petrovich Iakubinskii]].&lt;ref name=BrandistChown/&gt;

The leading linguist of the early Soviet era was [[Nicholas Marr]], known for his [[Japhetic theory]]. The theory suggested that the [[Kartvelian languages]] had a common origin with the [[Semitic languages]]. He also applied the idea of [[class struggle]] to the development of language. After Marr died, a likely ghost-written article credited to [[Stalin]] blasted Marr's theory, stating "Soviet linguistics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula which is contrary to the whole course of the history of peoples and languages." Politically, World War II caused a rise in [[nationalism]], which Japhetic theory argued against. This theory was never accepted outside the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;THOMAS JOHN SAMUELIAN, "THE SEARCH FOR A MARXIST LINGUISTICS IN THE SOVIET UNION, 1917-1950" (January 1, 1981). Dissertations available from ProQuest. Paper AAI8117848.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">'''Lurish music''' is referred to an ethno-cultural characteristic of [[Lurs|Lurs]] in the [[middle-east]]. The Lurish music enjoys a various and ancient background,&lt;ref&gt;Majedi, H and S. Shamlukia, (2008): Investigating the impact of nature and the environmen on the Iranian music.(In Persian) Environmental sciences and technology: volume13, Number2, Pages 95-103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saeb, Reza.

Retrieved on 03 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be divided into two parts; vocal music and [[instrumental]].
[[File:Lurish-Sorna.jpg|320px|thumb|right|A Lur musician performing [[Sorna]] at a wedding ceremony]]

== Types of Music ==
Based on the songs, the Lurish music is divided into seven sections; 
* Music of lyrics and romantic songs: Including music regarding lyrics that is about the expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. These musics like Heylaw, Binâ-binâ, [[Khosrow and Shirin|Shirin &amp; Khosrow]] lyrics, Sârixâni and Miruna (Mirbaygi) are performed in different Lurish music [[mugham]]s.
* Music of Epic-Combat songs: These hymns represent the epic and combat values of the warriors among the tribes. The most famous examples of this section are Jange Loru and Dâya-Dâya.
* Music and songs of mourning: This music has more to do with the rituals and has been used extensively in mourning ceremonies from the ancient times. Čamari (also Čamariuna), Sahari, Šivani and Pâkotali are from the most famous of these moghams.
* Music and songs of seasons: music and special songs of different seasons like Barza-kuhi, Kuč-bâru and Mâla-jiri
* Music and songs related to work activities: To ease and speed up the work of nomadic men and women, these songs (e.g Barziari, Hawla)are sung individually or collectively.
* Comic music and songs: These are usually originated from impromptu satires about  people, places or objects and are sometimes accompanied by humorous dramatic movements of someone or people.
* Religious hymn-music: These are generally based on the words of [[Yarsanism|Yaresan]] (from the hymns of Ahle-haq), and their mystical and religious aspects are very deep.

== Music instruments ==
The most popular Lurish musical instruments include [[Sorna]], [[Dohol]], Tâl (Lurish [[kamancheh]]),&lt;ref&gt;Oloumo, M.(2015).Kamanche, the Bowed String Instrument of the Orient.International Journal of Arts and Commerce.Vol4, No 1,  92-101, available online at:[http://www.ijac.org.uk/January2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tonbak]] (Tomak), and the common Iranian traditional instruments. Meanwhile, the Lurish kamancheh is the only one    that is fundamentally different from other ethnic music instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/talllorestan/docs/_________________ تحقیق در مورد تال (کمانچه لرستان)]، سید رسول صدریه.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lurs select the [[Dastgāh-e Māhur|Mâhur]]
as their basic musical step  to showcase the magnificence, grandeur and independence of their people.&lt;ref&gt;Majedi, H and S. Shamlukia, (2008): Investigating the impact of nature and the environment on the Iranian music.(In Persian) Environmental sciences and technology: volume13, Number2, Pages 95-103&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1979 revolution of Iran ===
After [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution of Iran]] due to intense encounters with musical performances, especially ethnic music, the amount of music participation in different parts of the life of the [[Lurs]] was reduced however in the past, cheerful music and lyrics were accompanied with collective dance.

A '''mano''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''hand'') is a [[ground stone]] tool used with a [[metate]] to process or grind food by hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mano ''Mano.''] Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Retrieved December 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Manos were used in [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times to process wild seeds, nuts and other food, generally used with greater frequency in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], when people became more reliant upon local wild plant food for their diet.  Later, manos and metates were used to process cultivated [[maize]].&lt;ref name=Gibbon&gt;Gibbon, Guy E.; Ames, Kenneth M. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_0u2y_SVnmoC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia''.] pp. 107, 166. {{ISBN|0-8153-0725-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early use in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]], the mano and metate were used to grind wild plants.  The mano began as a one-handed tool and once cultivation of maize became more prevalent, the mano became a larger, two-handed tool that more efficiently ground food against an evolved basin or trough metate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Plog|Plog, Stephen]]. (1997). ''Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest.'' London: Thames and Hudson. pp. 68-70. {{ISBN|0-500-02116-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides food, manos and metates were used to separate and pulverize [[clay]] from earthen debris and stones.  The resulting clay was used for [[pottery]]-making.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Plog|Plog, Stephen]]. (1997). ''Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest.'' London: Thames and Hudson. p. 66. {{ISBN|0-500-02116-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grinding process ==
[[File:Metate-and-Mano.jpg|thumb|Metate and mano.]]

A mano, a smooth hand-held stone, is used against a [[metate]], typically a large stone with a depression or bowl.  The movement of the mano against the metate consists of a circular, rocking or chopping grinding motion using one or both hands.&lt;ref&gt;Sutteon, Mark Q.; Arkush, Brooke S. (2001). ''Archaeological Laboratory Methods: An Introduction.''] Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. p. 72-75. {{ISBN|0-7872-8153-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Pueblo People]] often set up work rooms, called mealing rooms, that were established with sets of manos and metates for mass grinding efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Plog|Plog, Stephen]]. (1997). ''Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest.'' London: Thames and Hudson. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-500-02116-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marguerite Kuczynski''' (born Marguerite Steinfeld:  5 December 1904 – 15 January 1998) was a European economist and literary scholar.   She was born and died in [[Germany]]. Some of her most productive and (especially for English-language readers) best documented years were spent in [[England]], where she also achieved some notability as a feminist campaigner.&lt;ref name=MKlautUteLampalzer&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OYpLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Marguerite+Kuczynski+Women%E2%80%99s+Co-operative+Guild&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g0S12OmYvE&amp;sig=a6wm0VKp83CUHe-3vWcniv5T4mo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAWoVChMI4uja6pLdxwIVyewUCh0YDANM#v=onepage&amp;q=Marguerite%20Kuczynski%20Women%E2%80%99s%20Co-operative%20Guild&amp;f=false|title=Marguerite Kuczynski (1904-1998): Wirtschaftswissenschaftliches Arbeiten in verschiedenen Ländern und Zeiten|author=Ute Lampalzer|publisher=Books on demand, Norderstedt / Zentral- Und Landesbibliothek Berlin |isbn=978-3-925516-40-5 |date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Marguerite Steinfeld was born in 1904 [[Bischheim, Bas-Rhin|Bischheim]], a small town just to the north of [[Strasbourg]], and at that time part of the [[German empire]].  When she was 14, the entire region was [[Treaty of Versailles|transferred to France]] following Germany's defeat in World War I.   Steinfeld trained initially to work as a teacher. By 1920 she was studying at the [[Brookings Institution|Brookings School]] in [[Washington DC]], where an early influence was the eminent statistician [[Ethelbert Stewart]].&lt;ref name=MKlautUteLampalzer/&gt;   While there, she got to know fellow German [[Jürgen Kuczynski]], who was doing post-graduate work.&lt;ref name=MarStelautAxelFS&gt;{{cite book|title=Jürgen Kuczynski: A German-Jewish Marxist Scholar in Exile|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h5hfYijlxL4C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Marguerite+Kuczynski+%22Brookings+School%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PuR7eE3olc&amp;sig=Iyl84qlBr7GqtpEoymok2NwDC7o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwA2oVChMI1bm3jL_dxwIVDJ0aCh3pMgVY#v=onepage&amp;q=Marguerite%20Kuczynski%20%22Brookings%20School%22&amp;f=false|work=German Scholars in Exile: New Studies in Intellectual History|author=Axel Fair-Schulz|date=26 May 2011|isbn=978-0739150238}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently worked together and on 18 September 1928 they were married. In 1927 Steinfeld had taken a position as a research assistant at the recently established [[National Bureau of Economic Research]],&lt;ref name=MKlautUteLampalzer/&gt; in [[New York City]]. In the summer of 1929, the young couple returned to Europe and settled in [[Berlin]].

In January 1933 the [[NSDAP|NSDAP (Nazi party)]] [[Machtergreifung|took power]] and lost little time in setting up a one-party state in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].  Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi Party) became illegal, and the ban on political parties was enforced with particular effect in respect of (former) [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] members. During the next few years, the Nazi party increasingly expressed the strident anti-Semitism which had been featured in Nazi rhetoric during that party's years in opposition. During 1933 the Nazis arrested and imprisoned many German communists; others left the country to avoid the same fate.  Sources indicate that as early as February/March 1933, the Kuczynskis discussed following other family members into emigration, but at this point they decided to stay in Germany and participate in [[German Resistance to Nazism|anti-fascist resistance]].&lt;ref name=antifaJK&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antifa.vvn-bda.de/2014/09/11/im-dienst-des-antifaschismus/|title=Im Dienst des Antifaschismus:  Zum 110ten Geburtstag von Jürgen Kuczynski|author=Michael Landmann|publisher=Zeitschrift "antifa" (VVN-BdA), Berlin|date=August 2014|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Eventually, in January 1936, emigration could be put off no longer, however,&lt;ref name=antifaJK/&gt; and the couple moved to [[England]].&lt;ref name=IndyobitJK&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-jurgen-kuczynski-1245205.html |title= Obituary: Professor Jurgen Kuczynski |author= [[David Childs (academic)|David Childs]]|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London| date=13 August 1997|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the two of them continued their work as left-wing economists while also engaging in anti-Fascist work, some of it legal: some not.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;  Marguerite published a number of articles on the labour market, wages and the position of workers, sometimes in collaboration with her husband.&lt;ref name=MKlautAB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiz1.fh-potsdam.de/volltext/frei/07369.pdf|author=Agnieszka Brockmann|title=Archivierung der Nachlässe als landesbibliothekarische Aufgabe: Der Kuczynski - Nachlass in der Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin |publisher=Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin, Historische Sammlungen |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also participated in [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] immigrant organisations and, later in the decade, established a library for the English branch of the [[:de:Free German League of Culture in Great Britain|Free German League of Culture (''Freier Deutscher Kulturbund'')]].&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt; She directed the library until the couple returned to Berlin in 1946. Up until 1942, she worked as secretary to the War Committee of German Woman Refugees (''Kriegshilfskomitees deutscher Flüchtlingsfrauen'').&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;  In 1943 she was elected to the executive committee of the Women’s Co-operative Guild.&lt;ref name=MKlautAB/&gt; She gave lectures on the theme of Women's Resistance in [[Nazi Germany]], and contributed an essay to a compilation-publication entitled "Women under the Swastika".&lt;ref name=WomundSwaMK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;cqlMode=true&amp;query=idn%3D99349840X

[[Second World War|War]] ended in May 1945, with Berlin now at the heart of the [[Soviet occupation zone]] in what remained of Germany.   Several months after her husband, Marguerite Kuczynski returned to Berlin in March 1947; the couple at first lived in the same house they had inhabited before the war. It was now considered within the city's US occupation zone.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt; Kuczynski took a position with the city administration and then, as the ''de facto'' political division of the city began to appear more permanent, and a few years later to be reflected in physical frontier-divisions, she took work with the Finance Ministry in the Soviet zone.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt; Later, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet-administered]] occupation zone was reorganized and declared in October 1949, as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet-sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]]. At that time, Kuczynski began working for the East German Ministry for Overseas Trade (''"Außenwirtschaftsministerium"''). She gave up government work, however, contending that work there was "too amateurish" (''"zu dilettantisch"''). 

In any event, the real focus of power in East Germany, modeled on [[constitutional arrangements]] of the [[Soviet Union]], was not with government ministries but with the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Central Committee]] of the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED / ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'')]]. From 1957 Kuczynski worked as an academic researcher with the Central Committee's [[:de:Institut für Marxismus-Leninismus|Institute for Marxism–Leninism]]. In 1960 she retired from the Institute as well, finding it "too dogmatic". In the meantime, her outstanding achievements as a researcher with the Institute for Marxism–Leninism included a new edition of Karls Marx's early work, ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'', included in Volume 4 of the 43 volume [[:de:Marx-Engels-Werke|"Marx-Engels-Werke" series]] produced by the East German Party Central Committee between 1956 and 1990.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Kuczynski-Nachlass in der Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1n5meYixH7UC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Das+Elend+der+Philosophie+%22Marguerite+Kuczynski%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fod-lBgG4E&amp;sig=ZpGj8zRWN8LtAiIomyGsPZNeUuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAmoVChMInPqpu7jfxwIVZo7bCh1GFgbE#v=onepage&amp;q=Das%20Elend%20der%20Philosophie%20%22Marguerite%20Kuczynski%22&amp;f=false|pages=35-37|author=Agnieszka Brockmann|date=2011|publisher=Books on demand, Norderstedt / Zentral- Und Landesbibliothek Berlin |isbn=978-3-925516-39-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her contribution to the new edition of ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' was much enhanced by her use of an early French language edition, discovered following intensive research in Japan, in which Marx himself had penned extensive margin notes.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;

}}
Some of Marguerite Kuczynski's most enduring contributions to scholarship, produced only after her "retirement" in 1960, were a series of translations into German, supported by her own extensive and scholarly commentaries, of works by [[François Quesnay]] ([[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]]).&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;  Later, during the 1980s, she made a start on a similar set of translations of the work of economist-statesman [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], but this project remained unfinished because her eye-sight failed.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;

==Personal==
The Kuczynskis had three recorded children: Madeleine (1932), Peter (1937) and Thomas (1944).&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;  Of these, [[Thomas Kuczynski]] subsequently became notable as an economist and statistician, known in particular for his work on damages claims of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|victims of German wartime Forced labour policies]]. [[Rita Kuczynski]], known in German-speaking lands as a writer-philosopher (and more recently as a novelist), is a daughter-in-law of Marguerite Kuczynski.

Marguerite Kuczynski died in Berlin in January 1998, slightly more than five months after the death of her husband.&lt;ref name=KuczNachllautAgniBrock/&gt;  That year Thomas Kuczynski and his wife Rita divorced, following some years of separation.&lt;ref name=RitaBespr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertmagazin.de/alert.php?issue=8&amp;content=kuczynski|title=Rita Kuczynski  »Da wird immer noch Würzfleisch serviert - da scheint das Leben konserviert.«|author1=  Robin Alexander (as interviewer)|author2=Rita Kuczynski (as interviewee)|publisher=Alert Interviews, Berlin &amp; [[Die Tageszeitung]]|date=29 July 2002|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Melammu Project''' investigates the continuity, transformation and diffusion of [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Near East]]ern [[culture]] from the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BCE]] through the [[ancient history|ancient world]] until [[Islam]]ic times. It does so by organizing [[academic conference|conferences]] and by providing resources relevant to the project on its [http://melammu-project.eu/ website].

==History, Purpose and Organization of the Project==
The Melammu Project was founded during its first conference in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in 1998, as an offshoot of the [[Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project]]. Its purpose is to investigate the continuity, transformation and diffusion of Mesopotamian and Ancient Near Eastern culture from the third millennium BCE through the ancient world until Islamic times. It has two main activities: to organize conferences, and to provide resources relevant to the project on its website.

Melammu Symposia are held regularly and serve to promote [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary research]] and [[cross-cultural studies]] by providing a forum in which cultural continuity, diffusion and transformation in the ancient world can be assessed systematically on a long-term basis. The emphasis is on continued interchange of ideas between specialists in different disciplines, with the goal of gradually but steadily increasing the number of participants and thus breaking down the walls separating the individual disciplines. Although each symposium focuses on a different theme, since the primary purpose of the symposia is to encourage interdisciplinary cooperation per se, papers and posters not necessarily related to a specific theme but contributing to the overall scope of the project are welcome at every meeting.

The online resources provided by the Melammu Project include a [[database]], a [[citation|bibliography]], a PDF library, and links to websites relevant to the project's focus. The database aims to collect textual, art-historical, archaeological, ethnographic and linguistic evidence concerning the heritage of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East and to make it easily accessible on the Internet. As the Melammu Project is envisioned as a 'community project', all resources are open-ended, which means that it is possible to submit information to enlarge and improve the database, bibliographies and lists of links through the website's submission forms.

The project is governed by a [[Board of directors|board]], which consists of [[Scholarly method|scholars]] from a wide variety of [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] related to the project's focus. The main function of the board members is to promote the project and its meetings in the academic community and to safeguard the continuity of the project. For that reason, although the exact board size can vary, the board always consists of equally sized groups of senior and junior scholars (loosely defined). These include the organizers of the next two meetings (if known), as well as scholars involved in the database. The board is always elected for two years at one of the Melammu Symposia; the last election took place in 2013, at Melammu Symposia 7. The board currently consists of eighteen members, and is chaired by Robert Rollinger.&lt;ref name=board&gt;[http://melammu-project.eu/project/prboard.html Melammu Project website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Melammu Database==
The Melammu Database contains documented links between the civilizations of Ancient Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Sumer]]) and contemporary and later civilizations that show the impact and continuity of [[religion]], [[political system]]s, [[art]] and [[iconography]], [[literature]], and other cultural and social phenomena as a result of both direct influence and of cultural diffusion.

There are two principal types of entries in the database. The first consists of [[citation]] from ancient texts. These entries are primary sources and consist of the ancient author's comments. Such entries have a "source" line which points to the ancient text and the Text-field contains a translation of the ancient source. There may be bibliographical citations as well if the passage has been discussed or commented on by other scholars. Wherever possible, there will be a hypertext link to the actual text of the ancient source.

The second type of entry consists of modern comparisons between features or phenomena in the ancient world that may show the effects of cultural contact or cultural diffusion. Entries of this type generally have a "[[bibliography]]" line that points to the scholarly assessment of this connection rather than a "source" line. However, if ancient sources are important for this connection, there may be a "source" line as well, sometimes including longer quotations, as in the first type. The Text-field will contain an outline of the argument connecting the features or phenomena.

==The Name and logo of the Melammu Project==
The name Melammu and its logo were chosen to illustrate essential aspects of the cross-cultural processes that the Project investigates. The word melammu, which means "divine radiance, splendour, nimbus, aura," is an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[loanword]] from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. It thus concretely attests to the transfer and continuity of a centrally important [[doctrine|doctrinal]] concept from an [[ideology|ideological]] system to a later one. In Mesopotamia alone, this concept has a documented continuity of over 4500 years, from the earliest [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] religious and historical documents (ca. 2600 BC) until the present day. The iconography of the concept has gone a long way from the radiance surrounding Mesopotamian gods to the halos surrounding the heads of [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s and the loops hovering over the heads of [[christianity|Christian]] angels, but the concept itself has survived amazingly well and spread far beyond its original home.

The spread of the concept of "divine radiance" can be traced by observing the diffusion and transformations of the relevant iconographic motif. The logo of Melammu is taken from an [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid]] [[Seal (device)|seal]] discovered on the northeast coast of the [[Black Sea]] and represents the goddess [[Anahita]], mounted on a [[lion]] and surrounded by the divine radiance, appearing to a [[Persian empire|Persian]] [[king]]. The details of the king's and the goddess's dress and [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] are Persian, but in all other respects the seal is a faithful reproduction of centuries older Assyrian seals depicting appearances of the goddess [[Ishtar]] to members of the [[empire|imperial]] [[ruling class]]. It thus illustrates not only the adoption of the Mesopotamian concept of "divine radiance" by the Persians, but also the assimilation of an important Iranian deity to a Mesopotamian one with the concomitant adoption of a whole system of religious beliefs, cultic practices, ideological doctrines, and artistic conventions. The fact that the seal was found outside the area controlled by the Assyrian Empire and possibly carved by a [[ancient greece|Greek]] [[artist]], illustrates the dynamic diffusion of these ideas (through imperial propaganda) across geographical and cultural boundaries.

The radiance emitted by the goddess symbolizes to the Project the powerful impact of Mesopotamian culture on the surrounding world and later cultures, while the king symbolizes the crucial role of imperial courts in the preservation, transformation and diffusion of this cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simo Parpola]], {{cite web | title = The Name and Logo of Melammu | url = http://melammu-project.eu/project/prhiname.html}}, in Sanna Aro and R.

==The International Association for Intercultural Studies of the Melammu Project (2001-2013)==
At the Third Annual Symposium of the Assyrian and Babylonian Intellectual Heritage Project (Chicago, USA, October 27–31, 2000), the general assembly deliberated the foundation of an "International Association for Intercultural Studies of the Melammu Project", to be officially established through legal channels. However, during the general discussion at the end of the Melammu Symposia 7 (2013), it was decided by majority vote to absolve the association. The argument for doing so was that the association had never developed or functioned beyond its initial creation.&lt;ref name=association&gt;{{cite web | title = Statuto &amp; Statutes | url = http://melammu-project.eu/project/prhiassociation.html }}, in *A.

'''Mojari''' or '''Khussa''' or '''Saleem Shahi's''' is a style of [[Handicraft|handcrafted]] [[footwear]] produced in [[South Asia]].&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mojri.jpg|thumb |An embellished mojari{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 12 November 2012}}]] --&gt; They are traditionally made by [[artisan]]s mostly using tanned [[leather]]. The uppers are made of one piece of leather or [[textile]] embroidered and embellished with brass nails, [[cowry]] shells, mirrors, [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[ceramic]] [[bead]]s. Even the bonding from the upper to the [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] is done by cotton thread that is not only [[eco-friendly]] but also enmeshes the leather [[fiber]]s with great strength. Some product range also uses bright and ornate threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feet &amp; footwear in Indian culture|author= Jutta Jain-Neubauer|author2=Bata Shoe Museum |publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd. |year=2000|isbn=81-85822-69-7 |pages=126, 175 |url= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it evolved through the centuries and is being produced by individual artisans, products vary in designs and colours. It encapsules [[cultural diversity]], local ethos and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Khussa shoes-symbol of the traditional culture of sindh/|author= Ishraqi Designs |url=http://www.ishraqi.com/betav1/khussa-shoes-symbol-of-the-traditional-culture-of-sindh/|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It is believed that one of the earliest examples of footwear worn on the Indian subcontinent is a sandal of wood, datable to circa 200 BC. During the 3rd and 4th Centuries in the Buddhist period, it was quite common to wear strapped sandals, and Indian kings wore sandals ornamented with precious jewels. Jaina literature shows that leather was used for the making of shoes, which protected the toes from getting injured. Hides of cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep and other wild animals were used.&lt;ref&gt; Feet and Footwear in Indian Culture, Jutta Jain-Neubauer, Bata Shoe Museum Foundation, Toronto, Canada, in association with Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd., p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mojari originated under the Mughal Empire, where it was decorated with colours, gems, and other ornaments. They are said to have been popularized under the Mughal King [[Jahangir|Saleem Shah]] and are often referred to as Saleem Shahis as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1133238|title=The shoe fits|author=Shazia Hasan|publisher=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also commonly worn with [[Shalwar Kameez]]. Although leather shoes have been worn for over 5,000 years by various civilizations, they should not be confused with Mojaris, because Mojaris are unique in their ornamental style, shape, and appearance. {{Specify|reason=They probably are, but the article doesn't yet make clear exactly how they are unique.}}

'''''Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer (Mariana Griswold)''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by American artist [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. It was designed in 1888 and cast in 1890. This artwork portrays the American author, art critic, and reformer [[Mariana Griswold Van Rensselaer]] (1851–1934), who "championed Saint-Gaudens in articles on his public monuments and relief sculptures".&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.104/|title=Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer (Mariana Griswold) - Augustus Saint-Gaudens - 17.104 - Work of Art - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription on the upper center of the sculpture, ''animvs non opvs'' ("the spirit, not the work") is a reference to Mrs. Van Rensselaer’s "high-minded aesthetic ideals".&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

[[File:MAP Building Facade.jpg|thumb|Pre-Columbian Art Museum Cusco, Peru. Building facade]]

The '''{{lang|es|Museo de Arte Precolombino}}''' (also known by its acronym '''MAP'''; in {{lang-en|Pre-Columbian Art Museum}}) is an [[art museum]] in [[Cusco]], [[Peru]], dedicated to the display of [[artefact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and examples of [[pre-Columbian art]]works drawn from all regions of [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|pre-Columbian Peru]]. The museum is situated on Plaza Nazarenas in Cusco's San Blas district, and has on permanent display exhibitions of some 450 individual representative artifacts that are drawn from the wider collection of its parent museum, the [[Larco Museum]] in the Peruvian capital [[Lima]].

==History of the building==
[[File:Cuzco MAP P1100838.JPG|thumb|Ceramic statue from the Museum]]
The building where the museum is now housed was originally an [[Inca]] ceremonial courthouse. In 1580, it was acquired by the ''[[conquistador]]'' [[:es:Alonso Díaz Moreno|Alonso Díaz]] and subsequently built over in Colonial style to become the home of an elite member of Cusco society, the [[Luis Jerónimo de Cabrera, 4th Count of Chinchón|Viceroy Hernandez de Cabrera]], for whom the mansion is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.boletomachupicchu.com/museo-arte-precolombino-cusco/|title=El Museo de Arte Precolombino en Cusco|website=Boleto Machu Picchu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then passed through many hands and had multiple functions, ultimately falling into a ruinous state. After a restoration by the [[Fundéu BBVA|Fundación BBVA]], the Museo de Arte Precolombino opened in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Ybarra, M. (2004, October 10). Not just artifact, but art. [[Los Angeles Times]], pp. E40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peruvian President [[Alejandro Toledo]] inaugurated the museum at the summit, saying "''we are showing the world our cultural wealth. I am profoundly proud that [we can give to the summit] a little of the culture that belongs not only to Peru, but also to [[Latin America]]… [The region must] look to its past to construct together a new Latin America with more health, education, justice for the poor and culture.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra.com.pe/noticias/cumbre/30523-2.shtml XVII Cumbre Presidencial del Grupo de Río&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Cuzco MAP P1100796.JPG|thumb|Ceramic vessel from the Museum]]
The works of art displayed at the museum, encompass a period of time ranging between 1250 BC and  AD 1532. There are a total of ten galleries: Formative, Nasca, Mochica, Huari, Chancay – Chimu, Inca, Wood, Jewelry and Stone, Silver, and Gold and Metals.

The Formative Gallery houses pieces from many diverse cultures. Among these are [[Cupisnique]], [[Salinar]], [[Vicus (Peru)|Vicus]], [[Viru culture|Viru]] and [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] in its older phase or “cavernas”. During this period (1250 B. C - 1 A. D.) there is a remarkable advance in ceramic art. Painting and sculpture take in place; there are beautifully naturalistic and symbolic representations; many of them enriched by the use of incise decoration in which the Cupisnique artist get to a high development.

The Inca culture conquered all the territory of [[pre-Columbian]] Peru where they restored with great political ability the [[Tahuantinsuyo]] empire. In the Inca Gallery magnificent ceramic objects are showcased like the emblematic ''[[aribalo]]s'' or monumental vessels. These pieces have many decorative elements that transmit a subtle message of organization and symbolism. One of these ''aribalos'' is of great size and is unique to the collection.

'''Nyayakusumanjali''' ('' A Handful of Flowers of Logic'') is a treatise in [[Sanskrit]] composed by 10th century CE Indian logician and philosopher [[Udayana]]. The work has been described as codification of the Hindu proof for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edward Byles Cowell , Udayaṇācārya , Haridāsa Bhaṭṭācāryya|title=The Kusumānjali; Or, Hindu Proof of the Existence of a Supreme Being|date=1864|publisher=Printed at the Baptist Mission Press|url=https://archive.org/details/kusumnjaliorhin00bhagoog|accessdate=23 November 2016|ref=proof}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant|date=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791436837|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that this treatise is the most elaborate and the most fundamental work of the Nyaya-Vaiseshika school on the Isvara doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An outline of Nyaya-kusumanjali==
In [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] writings a ''prakarana'' refers to a genre of work that may be considered as roughly equivalent to the Western concept of a [[monograph]]. Nyayakusumanjali is a treatise belonging to this genre.  Since the work consists of verses (known as ''karika''s) interspersed with prose, it can be considered as a work of the genre Misra-prakarana (meaning "mixed-''prakarana''").

There are seventy-three verses in Nyayakusumanjali. These verses are distributed unevenly in five chapters (called  ''Stabaka''s, that is, "cluster of blossoms" or  "bunch of flowers"). These chapters contain respectively twenty, four, twenty-three, six and twenty verses. These verses form the core of the work, the prose passage that accompanies each being an elaborate explanation of it.

After a few introductory lines,  Udayana enumerates five principal arguments which are said to invalidate the [[Existence of God|existence of Isvara]]: "With regard to this there are five erroneous opinions (which assert that there exists no Isvara) on the ground that: 
# there is no other-worldly means (of attaining) a world beyond; 
# even without assuming an Isvara the performance of the means of (attaining) the world beyond is possible; 
# there are arguments that make known the non-existence of Isvara; 
# even if Isvara existed, he would not be a source of valid cognition; and 
# there are no arguments that can validly establish his (existence)".&lt;ref name=chem&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various chapters of the Nyayakusumanjali deal with and refute these five erroneous opinions in the order in which they have been enunciated. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the first Stabaka refutes the view of the [[Carvaka]]s, the second the view of the [[Mimamsa]]kas, the third that of the [[Buddhist]]s, the fourth that of the [[Jainism|Jains]] and the fifth the view of the [[Samkhya|Samkhyins]].&lt;ref name=chem/&gt; Of the five chapters, the first four chapters have a negative tone in the sense that their main intention is to refute the objections of the different schools against the existence of Isvara. The last chapter has a positive tone in the sense that it tries to produce arguments and proofs for the existence of Isvara.

===Stabaka 1===

The first Stabaka begins with a dedicatory verse and it is followed with a statement regarding the theme dealt with in the book, namely the Supreme Soul. The author then summarises the reason for the logical discussion on Isvara: Despite the fact that Isvara is acknowledged by all philosophical schools and religious sects under some name or other, this study which is to be designated as reflection is made as an act of worship (upäsanä) that comes after the listening to the scriptures (sravanam). Then the  five objections against the existence of Isvara are listed.

Udayana lists five arguments for the existence of a supra-mundane means for attaining the other world. There is a supra-mundane cause because of the following reasons:

# This world is dependent on causes.
# The stream of causes is beginning-less.
# There is diversity of effects.
# There is universal practice  of sacrificial rites etc.
# The experience (of pleasure and pain) is confined to each individual soul.

The discussion of these five arguments forms the subject matter of the first Stabaka.

===Stabaka 2===

In this Stabaka, Udayana tries to refute the argument that the transmission of Dharma or religious duties is possible without an Isvara.
Udayana argues that the transmission of Dharma or religious duties is possible, because of the following reasons:

# Validity of cognition is not intrinsic, but extrinsic.
# There are creations and dissolutions of the universe.
# There can be no confidence in the transmission of Dharma by a person other than Isvara.
# There is no other way of explaining the transmission of Dharma except through Isvara.

The explanation of these four themes forms the content of the second Stabaka.

===Stabaka 3===

Taking one by one the different means of valid cognition admitted by the opponents, Udayana shows in this Stabaka that none of them can disprove the existence of Isvara.

# Direct perception cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Inference cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Comparison cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Verbal testimony cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Implication cannot disprove the existence of Isvara.
# Non-perception cannot disprove the existence or Isvara.

===Stabaka 4===

The major portion of this Stabaka is devoted to the refutation of the Mimamsaka theory that valid cognition must be of an object not previously cognised. Udayana then shows that the cognition of Isvara cannot be said to be invalid even according to the definition of valid cognition given by the opponents.

===Stabaka 5===

Udayana brings forward in this Stabaka a number of proofs to establish the existence of Isvara. The various proofs can be summarized as follows. Isvara's existence is established from:

# ''käryatvät'': the fact that the earth etc., being effects, presuppose a cause that produces them.
# ''ayojanat'': the necessity of a conscious agent to impel the atoms to combine themselves and form the universe.
# ''dhrteh'': the necessity of a supporting agent of the universe preventing it from falling down.
# ''samharanat'': the necessity of a being endowed with the quality of effort in order to cause the dissolution of the universe into its ultimate components.
# ''padat'': the fact that at the time of the new creation an instructor is required to teach the living beings the different usages.
# ''pratyaydt'': the authoritativeness of the Vedic tradition.
# ''sruteh'': the fact that the Vedic nature of the Veda requires an omniscient author.
# ''anvayatah'': the fact that the Vedic sentences require a person as author.
# ''samkhyävisesat'': the necessity of a relating cognition, at the time of the origin of the universe, in order to produce the plural number which in turn causes magnitude in the triads.

==Other works by Udayana==
Seven works have been ascribed to Udayana. The following are the titles of the works in the chronological order in which they are believed to have been composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Chemparathy|title=An Indian rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyakusumanjali|date=1972|publisher=Indologisches Institut der Universität Wien, Sammlung De Nobili|location=Druck: Ernst Becvar, A-1130 Wien|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Laksanamala'': This is a short manual giving very clear definitions and the main divisions of the sixteen categories of the Nyaya and the six categories of the Vaisesika system.
*''Laksanavali'' : This work resembles the Laksanamala in form, purpose and method of treatment. It differs from the latter in that it deals exclusively with the Vaisesika categories and their subdivisions.
*''Atmatattvaviveka'': This is an independent work in four chapters of varying lengths. Each of these chapters is devoted to refute different theories put forward to establish the non-existence of a permanent soul (atma) such as conceived by the Nyäya-Vaisesikas.
*''Nyayakusumafijali'': (See outline above)
*''Nyayaparisista'': This deals exclusively with the Jatis and Nigrahasthanas, which form the subject matter of the fifth chapter of the Nyayasutras.
*''Nyayavarttikatatparyaparisuddhi'': This is an elaborate commentary on the Nyäyavarttikatätparyatika of Vacaspatimisra.
*''Kiranavali'': This is a  commentary on the Padarthadharmasamgraha of Prasastapada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15024">'''Public value''' describes the value that an organization contributes to society. The term was originally coined by [[Harvard]] professor [[Mark H. Moore]] who saw it as the equivalent of [[shareholder value]] in [[public management]]. Public value is supposed to provide managers with a notion of how entrepreneurial activity can contribute to the common good. Nowadays, public value is no longer limited to the [[public sector]], but is used by all types of organization, including [[non-governmental organization]]s and [[private sector]] firms. Therefore, the public value researcher [[Timo Meynhardt]] from the [[University of St. Gallen]] and [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management]] uses the term to generally raise the question about organizations' contribution to the [[common good]]. He believes that current management concepts, such as [[shareholder value]], [[Shareholder value#Stakeholder value|stakeholder value]], [[customer value proposition|customer value]], [[sustainability]] or [[corporate social responsibility]], should legitimize themselves in regard to their impact on the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. (2009). Public Value: Organisationen machen Gesellschaft. In: ''OrganisationsEntwicklung''. Zeitschrift für Unternehmensentwicklung und Change Management 2013, Nr. 4, S. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his (social-)psychological-based concept, public value emerges for individuals from the experiences made in social structures and relationships. Hence, it can be seen as a prerequisite and a resource for successful living.&lt;ref name="Meynhardt, 2009"&gt;Meynhardt, T. (2009). Public Value Inside: What is Public Value Creation? ''International Journal of Public Administration'', 32 (3-4), 192-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

''Public values are those providing normative consensus about (1) the rights, benefits, and prerogatives to which citizens should (and should not) be entitled; (2) the obligations of citizens to society, the state and one another; and (3) the principles on which governments and policies should be based.'' Bozeman, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Bozeman, B. (2007). ''Public Values and Public Interest: Counterbalancing Economic Individualism.'' Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public value is value for the public. Value for the public is a result of evaluations about how basic needs of individuals, groups and the society as a whole are influenced in relationships involving the public. Public value then is also value from the public, i.e., “drawn” from the experience of the public. The public is an indispensable operational fiction of society. Any impact on shared experience about the quality of the relationship between the individual and society can be described as public value creation. Public value creation is situated in relationships between the individual and society, founded in individuals, constituted by subjective evaluations against basic needs, activated by and realized in emotional-motivational states, and produced and reproduced in experience-intense practices.'' Meynhardt, 2009&lt;ref name="Meynhardt, 2009" /&gt;

''The definition that remains equates managerial success in the public sector with initiating and reshaping public sector enterprises in ways that increase their value to the public in both the short and the long run.'' Moore, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. (1995). Creating Public Value – Strategic Management in Government. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public Value (or Public Value Capital) then is the combined view of the public about what they regard as valuable.'' Talbot, 2006&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, C. (2006). ''Paradoxes and prospects of 'Public Value''. Paper presented at Tenth International research Symposium on Public Management, Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the public sector==
The research program on public value was kicked off by Professor Mark H. Moore of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who published a book on the subject, ''Creating Public Value. Strategic Management in Government'', in 1995. In this sense, public value can be instituted as an organising principle in a [[public sector]] organisation, providing a focus in the context of which individual employees are free to pursue and propose new ideas about how to improve the working of the organisation, in terms of [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] or services. Public organisations seeking to use public value as a principle need to create a corporate culture in which the pursuit of public values by employees is rewarded just as pursuing shareholder value is rewarded in private [[corporation]]s. 

The concept has been taken up initially by academics, [[think tank]]s and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and later by a number of public sector organisations in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries.

In 2004 it was used by the [[BBC]] as the cornerstone of its manifesto for the renewal of its charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/pdf/bpv.pdf|title=Building public value: Renewing the BBC for a digital world|last=|first=|publisher=BBC|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203212457/https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/pdf/bpv.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160610|title=The revolution that started in a library|last=Crabtree|first=James|date=27 September 2004|website=New Statesman|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Accenture]] launched the Institute for Public Service Value (IPSV), to explore how public value is created in government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-launches-institute-for-public-service-value-to-identify-and-promote-leading-practices-in-government-service-delivery.htm|title=Accenture Launches Institute for Public Service Value to Identify and Promote Leading Practices in Government Service Delivery {{!}} Accenture Newsroom|website=newsroom.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Parston, co-founder and former Chief Executive of the Office for Public Management, and a collaborator with Professor Moore, was appointed Director. Among many other studies, IPSV conducted the Global Cities Forum in 2007-2009, which facilitated  citizens' deliberations on their experiences and expectations of public value in 17 cities around the world. 

In 2006, the Center for Technology in Government (CTG) in partnership with [[SAP AG]], conducted research on the topic of public value in the context of governments' investments in [[information technology]] (IT). The results of this research found that governments' ability to realize the full value of IT investments is not completely measurable in terms of financial results. More specifically, the five U.S. and international governments studied, looked for the full value of government IT investments in both the internal value to government operations and the broader political and social returns to the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/issuebriefs/opengov_pubvalue.pdf|title=Delivering public value through open government|last=|first=|publisher=Center for Technology in Government, The Research Foundation of State University of New York|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117222318/https://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/issuebriefs/opengov_pubvalue.pdf|archive-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point of view, there are two sources of public value:

The German Federal Employment Agency uses the public value concept to better understand its contribution to society that goes beyond simple task fulfillment and make it a yardstick for management decisions. An empirical study has shown that a particular value of this organization is seen in its contribution to social peace in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. und Bartholomes, S. (2011). (De)Composing Public Value: In Search of Basic Dimensions and Common Ground. ''International Public Management Journal'', 14 (3), 284–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the private sector==
Public value is also taken up by private sector companies that want to maintain a license to operate and understand what implications new strategies and projects might have in terms of public value creation/ destruction. Such analyses can be done using a Public Value Scorecard as proposed by [[Timo Meynhardt]] and Peter Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. and Gomez, P. (2013). Organisationen schöpfen Wert für die Gesellschaft. In: Heuser, J. et al. ''DIE ZEIT erklärt die Wirtschaft'' (199–207). Hamburg: Murmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Public value acknowledges that established business paradigms such as [[Customer value maximization|customer value]] or [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholder value]] risk overemphasizing certain aspects of business' value contribution to society at the expense of other important dimensions. It pledges for a redefinition of the entire notion of value creation as it takes utilitarian and hedonistic as well as political and moral aspects of value creation into account.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T., Gomez, P. and Schweizer, M. (2014). The Public Value Scorecard: what makes an organization valuable to society? ''Performance'', 6 (1), 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of firms use public value to obtain management information helping to take strategic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2667302083&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=em0LQR7RWJs&amp;v=tLGAQ4q_Sb0 Public Value: ''Common Good and the Society''. Movie by the University of St. Gallen.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Fresenius Medical Care]], a German producer of medical supplies and operator of dialysis clinics, complements its [[balanced scorecard]] with the Public Value Scorecard. Through the inclusion of an external perspective the firm wants to gain a better understanding of the public value of healthcare service that are supplied by private firms. In a first project, the firm has systematically measured the public value of its dialysis centers in Great Britain. The management wants to use the insights gained in this study for positioning towards the firms' stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Armsen, W.; Lampe, R.; Moeller, S. and Gatti, E. (2013); Gesundheitsdienstleistungen in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung: Die Messung des gesellschaftlichen Nutzens privatisierter Gesundheitsdienstleistungen. ''OrganisationsEntwicklung'', 2013 (4), 20-26&lt;/ref&gt;
*The football club [[FC Bayern Munich]] uses to public value approach to systematically assess the challenges pertaining to its societal role that come along with its growth from a regionally embedded football club to a global entertainment brand. For a football club that enjoys permanent public attention and is seen as a role model by many people, such questions are especially relevant. Different public values such as "Mia san mia" (Bavarian for "us is us") and "global brand image" are partly in tension with each other. The structured compilation of the club's societal value can be used as management information for strategic decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Beringer, L. and Bernard, S.

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Feferman''' (December 13, 1928 – July 26, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illc.uva.nl/LogicList/newsitem.php?id=7645&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] with works in [[mathematical logic]]. 

==Biography==
Feferman was born in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]] from working class parents who had emigrated to the United States after [[World War I]] and had met and married in New York. Neither had any advanced education.  The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16. He received his B.S. from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1948 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1957 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Alfred Tarski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=19858}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being drafted from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was hired with appointments in the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at [[Stanford University]], where later he became the [[Patrick Suppes]] Professor of Humanities and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171024072327/http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 and 1986&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/solomon-feferman/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/june4/feferman-64.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to deliver the [https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/tarski Tarski Lectures] in 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved December 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was the editor-in-chief of the five volumes of ''Collected Works'' of [[Kurt Gödel]] that were published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.

Together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he wrote a biography of [[Alfred Tarski]]: ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' in 2004.

He worked on predicative mathematics, and in particular introduced the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16773">Religious economy refers to religious persons and organizations interacting within a market framework of competing groups and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; An economy makes it possible for religious suppliers to meet the demands of different religious [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"&gt;Wortham, Robert A. Religious Choices and Preferences: North Carolina's Baskin Robbins Effect? 2004. 27 Sep. 2007. [http://www.ncsociology.org/sociationtoday/v21/religion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By offering an array of religions and religious products, a competitive religious economy stimulates such activity in  a [[marketplace|market]]-type setting.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"/&gt;

The field applies [[rational choice theory]] to the [[theory of religion]] such that [[supply and demand]] are used to model the development and success of [[organized religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major proponents of the theory include [[William Sims Bainbridge]],  [[Roger Finke]], [[Laurence Iannaccone]], and [[Rodney Stark]].

==Major debates==
The idea of religious economy frames religion as a product and as those who practice or identify with any particular religion as a consumer. But when the idea of belief is brought into the equation, this definition expands, and [[ideology]] affects the "product" and who "consumes" it. When examining depictions of religious identity in a global world, it is easy to see how ideology affects religious economy.

[[Carl L. Bankston]] III refers to religions and religious groups as "…competing firms [that vie for] customers who make rational choices among available products…" (311). Using a liberal economic (see [[Economic liberalism]]) framework for analysis, Bankston is claiming that religions and religious groups’ popularity is dependent on the laws of supply and demand. As a marketplace, religious consumers are subject to things such as marketing, availability of product, resources, brand recognition, etc. But unlike some actual commodity such as a computer, these commodities speak to an individual’s beliefs. Bankston poses the idea that belief deals with ideology and extends beyond what one would typically define as a market good by stating "…belief is produced and resides in communicated thoughts, (and) the consumers of goods of faith can only become consumers by becoming producers, by participating in interactions of belief…" (322).

===Secularization and religious economy===
{{Main|Secularization}}
Prior to the emergence of the theory of religious economy some scholars of religion, such as Steve Bruce,&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that [[modernization]] would lead inevitably to the erosion of religiosity. These sociologists have predicted the disappearance of religion from [[Earth]], based on the decline in religious belief and observance in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt; According to the theory of religious economy, societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; This is refuted in the orthodox view by stating that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then they are less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context. If nothing is shared, then nothing is shunned, and there is thus a loss in observance of modern liberal traditions.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"/&gt;

====Revival====
According to [[Rodney Stark]], revival is another aspect of religious change which coincides with [[secularization]].  Over time established religious groups will spawn smaller and less worldly subgroups of the faith.  This trend of revival provides a plausible explanation why religion never seems to fade away and to why previously prominent religious organizations have dissipated.  Revival produces a shift in which religious groups a population will follow and proves effective against the demise of religion.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Cults====
Unlike a sect which follows traditions from its parent religion, a cult presents completely new religious traditions.  Cult is simply another word for a new religion and all current religions at one point could have been considered cult movements.  The negative connotations on the word cult have led to hostility between these movements and their social environments. [[Rodney Stark]] defines the two reactions from [[secularization]] being revival and cult formation. As old faiths eventually weaken the rise of different religious sects and cults will prevail.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Strict regulations to enforce strong ties====
Strict Churches are prevalent in the US and around the world and while people still question and debate their ascent, their ties are characteristically defined as being strong within the group with few weak ties branching outside to other groups. Strict churches arise from strict doctrines and can be in many forms such as large churches, sects, or cults but are not limited to these. Churches are most often known for their “cosmopolitan networks, while sects tend to consist of intense local networks,”&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, 2007. ''Sociology''. Tenth Edition. Thomas Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-495-09344-0}}./&lt;/ref&gt; while this may be true for “unstrict” doctrines this is not always the case for strict doctrines. Strong doctrines can arise from certain sects as various religions have done such as [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Islam]], certain denominations of [[Christianity]], or can include rather smaller cults or small sects. What all strong doctrines employ though, are formal controls to discourage [[Free rider problem|free riding]] within the group and to keep the church strong and together.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael. Principles of Group Solidarity. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06462-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These controls can vary from church to church but all serve the same purpose of keeping group solidarity.

As commonly seen strict churches employ various means of keeping their ties in their church strong while limiting excessive access to other groups such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with other groups. The implication of these, “strict demands ‘strengthen’ a church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of membership.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"&gt;Laurence R. Iannaccone, 1994. "Why Strict Churches Are Strong,"  ''American Journal of Sociology'', 99(5), pp. [http://religionomics.com/iannaccone/papers/Iannaccone%20-%20Strict%20Churches.pdf 1180-1211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Complying with these demands prevent the members of a church from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength of the ties within the group. Those who don’t comply with these strictures are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"/&gt; These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and together while screening out members that may actually harm the church unintentionally by being free loaders within the group.

===Church-sect theory===
&lt;!-- Not sure this section belongs in this article, as it seems off-topic. --&gt;
Originally proposed by [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] in his book ''The Social Sources of Denominationalism'', the theory discusses the difference between churches and [[sects]]. Niebuhr proposed that there is a cycle which [[sects]] and churches follow. Religions originate as [[sects]] designed to serve the needs of the deprived. If they flourish, they increasingly serve the interests of the middle and upper classes and are transformed into churches. Once the sects have become churches they become less effective in satisfying the needs of the lower class and the formation of a sect is re-created.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

In 1963 Benton Johnson revised the church-sect theory into its current state.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; Church and sect form opposite poles on an  axis representing the amount of "tension" between religious organizations and their social environments.  Tension, as defined by Benton Johnson, is "a manifestation of deviance." &lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The tension is described to be between the groups members and the outside world.  Churches are described as religious bodies having low tension, whereas, [[sects]] have high tension.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Ideology====

Some social scientists have become increasingly uncomfortable with what they see as the intermingling of social scientific analysis and free-market ideology in rational choice theory.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Michael. Rationality and the Ideology of Disconnection. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have likewise raised critical questions about the ideological use of neo-classical economic metaphors in rational choice theorizing about religion &lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2013). 'Ideology and the Market Metaphor in Rational Choice Theory of Religion: A Rhetorical Critique of “Religious Economies”'. Critical Sociology, vol 39, no. 4 [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3714/1/rational_choice_critique_author_final_version.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The ''theory of religious economy'' arises from the application of fundamental principles of economics to the analysis of religious organizations. Just as commercial economies consist of a market in which different firms compete, religious economies consist of a market (the aggregate demand for religion) and firms (different religious organizations) seeking to attract and hold clients.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The theory of religious economy was developed to explain why and how religions change.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

==Market situation==
According to the theory, [[religious pluralism]] gives the population a wide variety of choices in religion and leads to a religious economy in which different [[religious organizations]] compete for followers, much the way businesses compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. The Theory of Religious Economy takes into account a wide spectrum of issues (e.g., the differences between competitive religious markets and religious [[monopoly|monopolies]]), making this theory one of the most significant developments in the social scientific study of religion during the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory  focuses attention on religious suppliers and whether religious firms have the ability to increase the demand for religion.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt;

In a free market, or [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] religious market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. Organizations in a free market cannot rely on the state for resources so they must compete for participation of the religious consumer. Contest among religious firms results in the specialization of products so that consumers are able to distinguish different organization from others(Chesnut). Pluralistic religions operate on a personal scale, marketing more to individual demands as opposed to public. As the majority of the consumer market, organizations market more to women than men. Pluralism is only possible through lack of favoritism by the state.(Chesnut) A competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A [[microeconomic]] theory of the [[household production function]] and time allocation is associated with the work of [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;• Gary S. Becker, 1965. “A Theory of the Allocation of Time,” ''Economic Journal'' 75 (299), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2228949 p. 493]-517.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____, 1973. "A Theory of Marriage: Part I." ''Journal of Political Economy'', 81(4), pp. [http://www.fep.up.pt/docentes/pcosme/micro-g102/beckerJPE1973.pdf 813-846.]&lt;/ref&gt; An influential approach dating from the 1970s adapts that theory to explain religious participation and a resulting formation of norms. It postulates stable preferences and [[rational choice]] constrained by limited [[human capital|human]] and [[social capital]] to explain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;• Corry Azzi and [[Ronald Ehrenberg]],  1975. "Household Allocation of Time and Church Attendance," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 83(1), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1833272 27]-56.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Ronald G. Ehrenberg]], 1977. "Household Allocation of Time and Religiosity: Replication and Extension,"
''Journal of Political Economy'', 85(2), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1830802 415]-423.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Gary S. Becker, 1996. ''Accounting for Tastes'', Harvard. ch. 11. sect. 3, "'Churches' and the Formation of Norms," pp. 227-30.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Lawrence A. Young, ed., 1997. ''Rational Choice Theory and Religion: Summary and Assessment'', Routledge.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=4dMzunjcz4QC&amp;dq=%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s  Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=4dMzunjcz4QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  links.]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Rodney Stark]], 2006. "Economics of Religion," in ''The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion'', Ch. 3, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUHk_NCP0AC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=f=false 47-67.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in economics, the market situation can be described with concepts about monopoly, prohibition, and pluralism. Monopolies in religion are only made possible through state enforcement and often function on a public scale. When the government establishes a set religion and all other competition is drowned out then "believers are culturally connected but not necessarily spiritually"(Andrew Chesnut) to the religion enforced by the state. Since participation in a religious monopoly is not as important because the church does not have to rely on members for resources they are not forced to provide adequate or marketable "religious products"(Chesnut), due to lack of competition. The ability of a religious organization to monopolize a religious economy is entirely dependent on the extent to which the state governs the religious economy. A monopolized religious economy tends to have lower levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states may categorically ban religious observances, and attempt to sanction those who persist in displaying religious conviction. [[Disestablishmentarianism]] results from state withdrawal from an organization that was originally established under the state.

Religious markets are similar to other markets in that they are social creations. The exchanges that take place in a religious market are regulated by social factors. Elements of social interactions such as norms and morals influence the individual choices and preferences of the religious consumer. Therefore, elements of social interactions influence the types of religious goods offered to consumers in the marketplace and the changes in consumer demands over a span of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to [[W. Robertson Smith]], "The fear of the gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of morality".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Smith, W.: Religion of the Semites; with a new introduction by Robert A. Segal., New Brunswick, N.J. : Transaction Publishers, c2002.&lt;/ref&gt; People are taught that those who believe will gain rewards or avoid punishment in the afterlife, and non-believers will miss out on the rewards or receive punishment.

Undermatching is considered as a serious issue in higher education, and it is getting increased attention from education researchers and policymakers. Undermatching can affect long-term [[economic inequality]] and [[social mobility]],&lt;ref name=twsNYTLeonhardt&gt;DAVID LEONHARDT, March 16, 2013, The New York Times, [http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/education/scholarly-poor-often-overlook-better-colleges.html Better Colleges Failing to Lure Talented Poor], Retrieved Aug. 30, 2014, "...Most low-income students who have top test scores and grades do not even apply to the nation’s best colleges...."&lt;/ref&gt; and it can negatively affect college graduation rates.

'''Vaudeville/bodabil in the Philippines''', more commonly referred to as '''bodabil''', was a popular genre of entertainment in the [[Philippines]] from the 1910s until the mid-1960s. For decades, it competed with film, radio and television as the dominant form of Filipino mass entertainment. It peaked in popularity during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945. Many of the leading figures of [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine film]] in the 20th century, such as [[Dolphy]], [[Nora Aunor]], [[Leopoldo Salcedo]] and [[Rogelio de la Rosa]], began their showbusiness careers in bodabil.

Bodabil is an indigenized form of [[vaudeville]], which had been introduced in the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=ccp4&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Nicanor Tiongson |editor=[[Nicanor Tiongson]] |encyclopedia=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art |title=Philippine Theater|edition=1st |year=1994 |publisher=[[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]|volume=VII |location=Manila |pages=54 |isbn=971-8546-30-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a hodgepodge of musical numbers, short-form comedy and dramatic skits, and even magic acts, often staged inside the [[Standalone movie theaters of the Philippines|theaters of Manila]].&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt; Bodabil proved the vehicle for the popularization of musical trends and musicians, performance genres and performers.&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt;

==Origins==

At around the beginning of the [[American occupation of the Philippines]] at the turn of the 20th century, stage entertainment in the Philippines was dominated by the Spanish-influenced ''komedya'' and the newly emergent ''zarzuela'' (or "''sarswela''"). In order to entertain American troops stationed in the Philippines, vaudeville acts from outside the Philippines were brought in to provide entertainment.&lt;ref name=ccp8&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Doreen Fernandez |editor=[[Nicanor Tiongson]] |encyclopedia=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art |title=Philippine Theater|edition=1st |year=1994 |publisher=[[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]|volume=VII |location=Manila |pages=68|isbn=971-8546-30-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1901, a leading Manila theater, the ''Teatro Zorilla'', would promote some of these visiting vaudeville troupes as "Novelties in Manila".&lt;ref name=ccp8/&gt;

During these early years of vaudeville in the Philippines, most of the featured entertainers were non-Filipinos. By the middle of the 1910s, a few Filipino performers would begin to appear in vaudeville acts as well. The zarzuela star [[Atang de la Rama]] was among the first of such performers, as well as the singer [[Katy de la Cruz]], who first appeared on Manila stages aged 7. The routines they would perform were featured as [[intermission]] numbers in between sarswelas.&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt; These intermission numbers were sometimes called "jamborees".&lt;ref name=ccp9&gt;Fernandez, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaudeville to bodabil==

In 1920, a Filipino entertainer named Luis Borromeo returned from North America, renamed himself "Borromeo Lou", and organized what became the first Filipino bodabil company.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt; The main showcase of Borromeo Lou's company was an orchestral band, which played what he called "Classical-Jazz Music", and variety acts in between.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt; Borromeo's band is credited as having popularized jazz in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt; It was also Borromeo who dubbed the emerging form as "vod-a-vil", which soon became popularly known by its Filipinized name, bodabil.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt;

In 1923, there were three theaters in Manila that were exclusively devoted to bodabil.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt; By 1941, there were 40 theaters in Manila featuring bodabil shows.&lt;ref name=ccp9/&gt; The popularity of bodabil was not confined to Manila stages. Bodabil routines were also staged in town fiestas and carnivals.&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt; The typical bodabil shows would feature a mixture of performances of American [[ballads]], [[torch songs]] and [[blues]] numbers; dance numbers featuring [[tap dance]]rs and [[chorus girl]]s and [[jitterbug]] showcases; and even the occasional [[kundiman]]. 

Within that period, established performers such as Katy de la Cruz and Borromeo Lou continued to thrive. New stars also emerged, such as the singers [[Diana Toy]] and [[Miami Salvador]]; the dancer [[Bayani Casimiro]], and the magician and [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] imitator [[Canuplin]].&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt; Many leading lights of Philippine cinema began their entertainment careers in bodabil during this period, such as [[Rogelio de la Rosa]], [[Leopoldo Salcedo]], [[Dely Atay-Atayan]] and [[Chichay]]. Bodabil thrived despite the emergence of Filipino film productions. Many moviehouses featured bodabil performances in between screenings, and many film and bodabil stars frequently crossed over from one genre to the other.

==Bodabil during World War II==

The Japanese invasion of the Philippines in late 1941 led to a halt in film production in the country, at the insistence of the Japanese who were not keen to allow Western influences to persist within the country.&lt;ref name=ccp0&gt;Fernandez, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Bodabil however was permitted, and it became the predominant form of entertainment in the country. Many film actors whose careers had been stalled became regular performers in bodabil shows.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; 

Among the performers whose careers were jumpstarted during this period were [[Panchito Alba]], [[Anita Linda]], [[Rosa Mia (actress)|Rosa Mia]], the tandem of [[Pugo and Togo]], and [[Dolphy]], who started under the stage name "Golay" as a comic dance partner of Bayani Casimiro. 

Many bodabil shows during the war incorporated subtle anti-Japanese and pro-American messages.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; Pugo and Togo had a popular routine where they portrayed Japanese soldiers wearing multiple wristwatches on both of their arms, and they were soon briefly incarcerated for that spoof.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; There were comedic and dramatic skits that referred to the impending return of "''Mang Arturo''", an allusion to [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]]'s promise, "I shall return."&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; Even guerilla members attended bodabil shows, and when word reached the performers that the [[Kempetai]] were due to arrive, they'd break out into a special song that served as code to the guerillas to leave the premises.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt;

==Post-war bodabil==

Following the end of World War II, film production in the Philippines resumed, and many of bodabil's stars either returned or shifted to cinema. Bodabil however remained popular for the next two decades. A large credit to bodabil's continued popularity can be attributed to [[Lou Salvador, Sr.]], a performer with the stage name "Chipopoy" who shifted to production after the war. Salvador would become the most successful stage show impresario in the '40s and '50s.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= Galileo Zafra |editor=[[Nicanor Tiongson]] |encyclopedia=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art |title=Philippine Film |edition=1st |year=1994 |publisher=[[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]|volume=VIII |location=Manila |pages= 315–316 |isbn=971-8546-31-6 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He organized several bodabil troupes and discovered a new generation of bodabil performers, such as the comedians [[Chiquito (actor)|Chiquito]], [[Cachupoy]] and [[German Moreno]], the singers [[Pepe Pimentel]], [[Diomedes Maturan]], and [[Eddie Peregrina]].&lt;ref name=film/&gt; 

Bodabil continued to capitalize on the latest trends in Western entertainment. It featured popular Latin dances such as the mambo and cha-cha, or the [[boogie]], which was popularized by Chiquito.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; When [[rock and roll]] emerged in the 1950s, bodabil showcased [[Eddie Mesa]], who became known as the "[[Elvis Presley]] of the Philippines". In the late 1950s, singers such as [[Nora Aunor]], [[Elizabeth Ramsey]], [[Pilita Corrales]] and [[Sylvia La Torre]] also plied the bodabil circuit.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; Bodabil had also started to incorporate [[burlesque]] numbers into its routines.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt;

By the 1960s, bodabil had to compete as well with the rise of commercial television broadcasts in the Philippines. It underwent a swift decline, and by the late 1960s, the form drew on the limited market for its burlesque routines.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; The emergence of ''bomba'' films around 1969-1970, which killed off burlesque, also marked the end of bodabil.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt;

After martial law was declared in 1972, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] attempted to revive a sanitized form of bodabil. Theaters such as the [[Manila Grand Opera House]] again featured bodabil routines, with slogans praising martial law rule piped into the theaters in between numbers.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; These efforts proved unpopular. In the 1980s, activist groups within the [[University of the Philippines]] also tried to utilize the bodabil format, using the medium to promote socially conscious themes.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt;

==Critical perspectives==

While bodabil was undoubtedly popular and somewhat indigenized from vaudeville, it was hardly indigenous to the Philippines and seen as indicative of the pervasiveness of American culture in the country.&lt;ref name=ccp4/&gt; Many of the cultural trends it popularized were Western or American in origin, though the interpreters largely Filipino. At the same time, many older, and equally colonial forms of stage entertainment such as the komedya and the sarswela declined due to the rise of bodabil.

The influence of bodabil in Filipino culture arguably persists to this day.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt; Its hodgepodge of song and dance numbers are still recognizable in television variety shows and even in intermission numbers in political rallies.&lt;ref name=ccp0/&gt;

In [[phonetics]], '''voice onset time''' ('''VOT''') is a feature of the production of [[stop consonant]]s. It is defined as the length of time that passes between the release of a stop consonant and the onset of [[voiced consonant|voicing]], the vibration of the [[vocal folds]], or, according to other authors, periodicity. Some authors allow negative values to mark voicing that begins during the period of articulatory closure for the consonant and continues in the release, for those unaspirated voiced stops in which there is no voicing present at the instant of articulatory closure.
[[Image:Vot.svg|thumb|A graphical representation of the VOT of voiced, tenuis, and aspirated stops]]

==History==
The concept of voice onset time can be traced back as far as the 19th century, when Adjarian (1899: 119)&lt;ref name="Adjarian" &gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k57626142/f121.image ADJARIAN, H., Les explosives de l'ancien arménien étudiées dans les dialectes modernes, La Parole. Revue internationale de Rhinologie, Otologie, Laryngologie et Phonétique expérimentale, 119-127 (1899)] "''...&amp;nbsp;la relation qui existe entre deux moments : celui où la consonne éclate par l'effet de l'expulsion de l'air hors de la bouche, ou explosion, et celui où le larynx entre en vibration.''"&lt;/ref&gt; studied the Armenian stops, and characterized them by "the relation that exists between two moments: the one when the consonant bursts when the air is released out of the mouth, or explosion, and the one when the larynx starts vibrating".  However, the concept became "popular" only in the 1960s, in a context described by Lin &amp; Wang (2011: 514):&lt;ref name="LinWang"&gt;LIN, C. &amp; WANG, H., Automatic estimation of voice onset time for word-initial stops by applying random forest to onset detection, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 514-525 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; "At that time, there was an ongoing debate about which phonetic attribute would allow voiced and voiceless stops to be  effectively distinguished. For instance, voicing, aspiration, and articulatory force were some of the attributes being studied regularly. In English, "voicing" can successfully separate {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} from {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} when stops are at word-medial positions, but this is not always true for word-initial stops. Strictly speaking, word-initial voiced stops {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} are only partially voiced, and sometimes are even voiceless." The concept of VOT finally acquired its name in the famous study of Lisker &amp; Abramson (1964).&lt;ref name="Lisker"&gt;[http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0053.pdf LISKER, L. and ABRAMSON, A.S.,  A cross-language study of voicing in initial stops: acoustical measurements, Word Vol. 20, 384-422 (1964).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic problems==
A number of problems arose in defining VOT in some languages, and there is a call for reconsidering whether this speech synthesis parameter should be used to replace articulatory or aerodynamic model parameters {{Clarify|reason=the suggestion is made that the problematic parameter itself (i.e. VOT) should replace other parameters; what is the rationale of that? is this really what was meant by the writer?|date=July 2017}} which do not have these problems, and which have a stronger explanatory significance.&lt;ref&gt;ROTHENBERG, M. "Voice Onset Time vs. Articulatory Modeling for Stop Consonants", The Jan Gauffin Memorial Symposium, October 16, 2008. Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. ''(To be published in the proceedings)''&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the discussion below, any explication of VOT variations will invariably lead back to such aerodynamic and articulatory concepts, and there is no reason presented why VOT adds to an analysis, other than that, as an acoustic parameter, it may sometimes be easier to measure than an aerodynamic parameter (pressure or airflow) or an articulatory parameter (closure interval or the duration, extent and timing of a vocal fold abductory gesture).

==Types==
[[Image:Voice Onset Timing differences for English Tie and Die.jpg|thumb|right|Voice Onset Timing [[spectrograms]] for English "die" and "tie".  The voiceless gap between release and voicing is highlighted in red.  Here the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} has a VOT of 95&amp;nbsp;ms., and {{IPA|/d/}} has one of 25&amp;nbsp;ms.]]

Three major [[phonation]] types of stops can be analyzed in terms of their voice onset time.

*Simple unaspirated [[voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s, sometimes called "[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]]" stops, have a voice onset time at or near zero, meaning that the voicing of a following [[sonorant]] (such as a vowel) begins at or near to when the stop is released. (An offset of 15 [[millisecond|ms]] or less on {{IPA|[t]}} and 30 ms or less on {{IPA|[k]}} is inaudible, and counts as tenuis.)
*[[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspirated]] stops followed by a sonorant have a voice onset time greater than this amount, called a '''positive VOT'''. The length of the VOT in such cases is a practical measure of aspiration: The longer the VOT, the stronger the aspiration. In [[Navajo language|Navajo]], for example, which is strongly aspirated, the aspiration (and therefore the VOT) lasts twice as long as it does in [[English language|English]]: 160ms vs. 80ms for {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, and 45ms for {{IPA|[k]}}. Some languages have weaker aspiration than English. For velar stops, tenuis {{IPA|[k]}} typically has a VOT of 20-30 ms, weakly aspirated [k] of some 50-60 ms, moderately aspirated {{IPA|[kʰ]}} averages 80–90 ms, and anything much over 100 ms would be considered strong aspiration. (Another phonation, [[breathy voice]], is commonly called ''voiced aspiration''; in order for the VOT measure to apply to it, VOT needs to be understood as the onset of modal voicing. Of course, an aspirated consonant will not always be followed by a voiced sound, in which case VOT cannot be used to measure it.)
*[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] stops have a voice onset time noticeably less than zero, a "negative VOT", meaning the vocal cords start vibrating before the stop is released. With a "fully voiced stop", the VOT coincides with the onset of the stop; with a "partially voiced stop", such as English {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}} in initial position, voicing begins sometime during the closure (occlusion) of the consonant.

Because neither aspiration nor voicing is absolute, with intermediate degrees of both, the relative terms [[fortis and lenis]] are often used to describe a binary opposition between a series of consonants with higher (more positive) VOT, defined as ''fortis'', and a second series with lower (more negative) VOT, defined as ''lenis''. Of course, being relative, what fortis and lenis mean in one language will not in general correspond to what they mean in another.

Voicing contrast applies to all types of consonants, but aspiration is generally only a feature of stops and affricates.

==Transcription==
Aspiration may be transcribed {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʰ}}}}, long (strong) aspiration {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʰʰ}}}}. Voicing is most commonly indicated by the choice of consonant letter. For one way of transcribing [[pre-voicing]] and other timing variants, see [[extensions to the IPA#Diacritics]]. Other systems include that of Laver (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Phonetics'', p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguishes fully devoiced {{angle bracket|{{IPA|b̥a}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ab̥}}}} from initial partial devoicing of the onset of a syllable by {{angle bracket|{{IPA|˳ba}}}} and from final partial devoicing of the coda of a syllable by {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ab˳}}}}.

'''''Whassup?''''' (also known as '''''Wazzup''''') was a [[advertising|commercial]] campaign for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Anheuser-Busch Budweiser]] [[beer]] from 1999 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Business Pundit| author=Drea |date= February 2, 2011 | title=Best Super Bowl Commercials 1989-2010|url=http://www.businesspundit.com/best-superbowl-commercials-1979-2009/|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first spot aired during ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', December 20, 1999. The ad campaign was run worldwide and became a [[pop culture]] [[catchphrase]]. The phrase itself is a [[Slur (phonology)|slurred]] version of the phrase "[[wikt:what's up|What's up?]]".
		
The commercials were based on a [[Short subject|short film]], entitled ''True'', written and directed by [[Charles Stone III]], that featured Stone and several of his childhood friends – Fred Thomas, Paul Williams, Terry Williams, Jimmy "Puerto Rock" Perez and Kevin Lofton. The characters sat around talking on the phone and saying "whassup?" to one another in a comical way. The short was popular at a number of film festivals around the country and eventually caught the attention of creative director [[Vinny Warren]] and art director Chuck Taylor at the Chicago-based ad agency [[DDB Worldwide|DDB]], who took the idea to [[August A. Busch IV]], vice president of [[Anheuser-Busch]], and signed Stone to direct Budweiser TV commercials based on the film. [[Scott Martin Brooks]] won the role of Dookie when Kevin Lofton declined to audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="They're up: With a stop at Comerica Park, the friends starring in Budweiser's 'Whassup' commercials say hello to success, thanks to the beer guzzling of Dami  Stanworth" |date=April 21, 2000 |publisher=''[[Detroit Free Press]]''| url=http://www.freep.com/entertainment/newsandreviews/bud21_20000421.htm|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whassup?'' won the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Cannes Grand Prix]] award and the [[Clio Awards|Grand Clio award]], among others. In May 2006, the campaign was inducted into the [[Clio Awards|CLIO Hall of Fame]].

Eight years later, Stone made another version of the ad with the same cast, called ''Wassup 2008''. The 2-minute short film was heavily critical of the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] and was a clear endorsement of the presidential campaign of [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Luning|first=Earnest|title=‘Wassup’ commercial returns with same cast, political twist|date=2008-10-24|url= http://coloradoindependent.com/12820/wassup-commercial-returns-with-same-cast-political-twist|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 video was nominated for the Favorite User Generated Video award at the [[35th People's Choice Awards]].

==In culture==
The film ''[[Scary Movie]]'' (2000) parodied the ad in one scene.

In 2001, the British music duo [[Shaft (British electronica band)|Shaft]] released a song and video titled "Wassuup!" under the name Da Muttz, referencing the Budweiser ad, set to a sample of "[[U Can't Touch This]]" by [[MC Hammer]] (which, in turn, sampled [[Rick James]]' "[[Super Freak]]").&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached number 11 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt; and was also a hit on charts across Europe and in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Da+Muttz&amp;titel=Wassuup%21&amp;cat=s|title=Da Muttz – Wassuup!|website=australian-charts.com|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional wrestling tag team [[The Dudley Boyz]] incorporated part of the ad as one of their signature moves. [[D-Von Dudley|D-Von]] would climb to the top rope while [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Bubba Ray]] held an opponent's legs apart, before they both stuck out their tongues and did the Whassup head shake. D-Von would then execute a diving headbutt to the crotch of the opponent.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' episodes "[[The Bart Wants What It Wants]]" (2002) and "[[See Homer Run]]"{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} (2005) both feature the character [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] using the expression in an attempt to be cool.

The ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' episode "Father and Son Reunion" (2002) featured the character Gil trying to bond with his son Jimmy. Gil thinks all young people use the expression to be cool. They go out together along with Greg the Bunny and Gil shouts the expression at everyone they meet, much to the embarrassment of Jimmy.

In the 2003 ''[[Friends]]'' episode "The One With Phoebe's Rats", Ross enters Monica and Chandler's apartment saying "Whassup" trying to imitate the commercial, to which Chandler replies, "Seriously dude, three years ago!"

''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' episode "[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]" has Michael Scott, Jim, and Dwight exchanging the expression with each other. Jim wryly tells the camera that Scott is still doing it constantly, seven years after the ad was popular.

The ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "Multiple Meat" (2010) had [[Frylock]] using the expression to Master Shake and when the latter does not react to it he asks "I'm sorry is that out now?"

The ad is also parodied in four episodes of the web series ''[[The Annoying Orange]]''.

The band [[Falling in Reverse]] parodied the ad in the [[music video]] of the song "[[The Drug in Me Is You|Good Girls, Bad Guys]]" (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2012/06/18/music-video-falling-in-reverse-good-girls-bad-guys/|title=MUSIC VIDEO: FALLING IN REVERSE – GOOD GIRLS BAD GUYS|author= Grant Trimboli|date=June 18, 2011|publisher=www.underthegunreview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Central Intelligence]]'' (2016), Bob Stone sends Calvin Joyner a video clip of the ad and asks, "remember those commercials?"

In the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode "[[Trilogy Time]]" [[Barney Stinson]] uses the expression in supposed "dream" futures.

In Season 1, Episode 8 of [[Santa Clarita Diet]], [[Drew Barrymore]]’s character says "Whassup?" to a “dead” undead character Loki, played by [[DeObia Oparei]].

In the film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018) Luis pulls up next to Scott and says it multiple times.

June 2018, Burger King and Budweiser partnered to create a new Whassup? commercial.
