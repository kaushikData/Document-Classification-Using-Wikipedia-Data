The '''Academy of Fine Arts Vienna''' ({{lang-de|Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien}}) is a public [[art school]] of higher education in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The Academy is famous outside the arts community for rejecting [[Adolf Hitler]] twice (in 1907 and 1908), because of his "unfitness for painting" (see also, [[Paintings by Adolf Hitler]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== History ==
The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna was founded in 1692 as a private academy modelled on the [[Accademia di San Luca]] and the Parisien [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] by the court-painter [[Peter Strudel]], who became the ''Praefectus Academiae Nostrae''. In 1701 he was ennobled by Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] as ''[[Freiherr]]'' (Baron) of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. With his death in 1714, the academy temporarily closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_en/organisation/about-us/history |title=A Chronological History of the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts |publisher=Academy of Fine Arts Vienna |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aktsaal der Wiener Akademie (1787, Martin Ferdinand Quadal).jpg|thumb|left|Life drawing room at the Vienna academy, [[Martin Ferdinand Quadal]], 1787]]
On 20 January 1725, Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] appointed the Frenchman [[Jacob van Schuppen]] as Prefect and Director of the Academy, which was refounded as the ''k.k. Hofakademie der Maler, Bildhauer und Baukunst'' (Imperial and Royal Court Academy of painters, sculptors and architecture). Upon Charles' death in 1740, the academy at first declined, however during the rule of his daughter Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], a new statute reformed the academy in 1751. The prestige of the academy grew during the deanships of [[Michelangelo Unterberger]] and [[Paul Troger]], and in 1767 the archduchesses [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1738–1789)|Maria Anna]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]] were made the first Honorary Members. In 1772, there were further reforms to the organisational structure. Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Wenzel Anton Kaunitz]] integrated all existing art schools into the ''k.k. vereinigten Akademie der bildenden Künste'' (Imperial and Royal Unified Academy of Fine Arts). The word "vereinigten" (unified) was later dropped. In 1822 the art cabinet grew significantly with the bequest of honorary member [[Anton Franz de Paula Graf Lamberg-Sprinzenstein]]. His collection still forms the backbone of the art on display.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.akbild.ac.at/Portal/gemaeldegalerie/sammlung/geschichte History of the art collection] on the Academy's website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Akademie der bildenden Kuenste DSC 2400w.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Main entrance on Schillerplatz]]
In 1872 Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] approved a statute making the academy the supreme government authority for the arts. A new building was constructed according to plans designed by the faculty [[Theophil Hansen]] in the course of the layout of the [[Ringstraße]] boulevard. On 3 April 1877, the present-day building on Schillerplatz in the [[Innere Stadt]] district was inaugurated, the interior works, including ceiling frescos by [[Anselm Feuerbach]], continued until 1892. In 1907 and 1908, young [[Adolf Hitler]], who had come from [[Linz]], was twice denied admission to the drawing class. He stayed in Vienna, subsisting on his orphan allowance, and tried unsuccessfully to continue his profession as an artist. Soon he had withdrawn into poverty and started selling amateur paintings, mostly [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]], for meagre sustenance until he left Vienna for [[Munich]] in May 1913.

During the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Nazi Germany]] from 1938–1945, the academy was forced to heavily reduce its number of Jewish staff. After [[World War II]], the academy was reconstituted in 1955 and its autonomy reconfirmed. It has had [[university]] status since 1998, but retained its original name. It is currently the only Austrian university that doesn't have the word "university" in its name.

== Structure ==
The academy is divided into the following institutes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_en/institutes/institutes?set_language=en&amp;cl=en |title=Institutes |publisher=Academy of Fine Arts Vienna |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Institute for Fine Arts'', which houses thirteen departments: Abstract Painting; Art and Digital Media; Art and Photography; Arts and Research; Conceptual Art; Contextual Painting; Expanded Pictorial Space; Figurative Painting; Graphic Arts and Printmaking Techniques; Object Sculpture; Performative Art - Sculpture; Video and Video-installation; Textual Sculpture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_en/studies/institutes/fine-arts/departments ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064308/http://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_en/studies/institutes/fine-arts/departments |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Institute for Art Theory and Cultural Studies'' (art theory, philosophy, history);
* ''Institute for Conservation and Restoration'';
* ''Institute for Natural Sciences and Technologies in Art'';
* ''Institute for Secondary School Teaching Degrees'' (craft, design, textile arts);
* ''Institute for Art and Architecture''.

The Academy currently has about 900 students, almost a quarter of which are foreign students. Its faculty includes "stars" such as [[Peter Sloterdijk]]. Its library houses approx. 110,000 volumes and its "etching cabinet" (''Kupferstichkabinett'') has about 150,000 drawings and prints. The collection is one of the biggest in Austria, and is used for academic purposes, although portions are also open to the general public.

The meaning of the word '''''American''''' in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. ''American'' is derived from ''America'', a term originally denoting all of the [[New World]] (also called the [[Americas]]). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the [[United States of America]].

In modern English, ''American'' generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English|year=1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-06989-8|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA27}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080316032628/http://www.bartleby.com/68/37/337.html View at Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is seen by some as a semantic "misappropriation" by those who argue that "American" [[Linguistic prescription|should be widened]] in English [[semantic change|to also include]] people or things from anywhere in the American continents.&lt;ref name="Mencken"&gt;{{cite journal | first = H. L. | last = Mencken | title = Names for Americans | journal = American Speech | volume = 22 |date=December 1947 | pages = 241–256 | doi = 10.2307/486658 | issue = 4 | jstor=486658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gage"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Walter S.|last=Avis|first2=Patrick D.|last2=Drysdale|first3=Robert J.|last3=Gregg|first4=Victoria E.|last4=Eeufeldt|first5=Matthew H.|last5=Scargill|year=1983|encyclopedia=Gage Canadian Dictionary|title=American|location=Toronto|publisher=Gage Publishing Limited|page=37|isbn=0-7715-9122-5|edition=pbk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word can be used as either an [[adjective]] or a [[noun]] (viz. a [[demonym]]). In adjectival use, it means "of or relating to the United States"; for example, "[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer" or "the man prefers [[American English]]". In its noun form, the word generally means a [[demographics of the US|resident]] or [[United States nationality law|citizen]] of the US, or occasionally [[American ethnicity|someone whose ethnic identity is simply "American"]]. The noun is rarely used in [[American English]] to refer to people not connected to the United States.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; When used with a [[Grammatical modifier|grammatical qualifier]], the adjective ''American'' can mean "of or relating to the Americas", as in [[Latin America]]n or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]]. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in "[[Spanish dialects and varieties|American Spanish]] dialects and pronunciation differ by country", or the name of the [[Organization of American States]]. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], for instance, "In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest".

Compound constructions such as "[[African Americans]]" likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the United States of America, as does the [[prefix]] "[[:wiktionary:Americo-|Americo-]]". For instance, the [[Americo-Liberians]] and their language [[Merico language|Merico]] derive their name from the fact that they are [[African-American settlement in Africa|descended from African American settlers]], i.e. former slaves in the United States of America.

They generally have other terms specific to U.S. nationals, such as the German ''{{lang|de|US-Amerikaner}}'',&lt;ref name="de-dict"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/cgi-bin/wort_www.exe?site=1&amp;Wort=US-Amerikaner|title=US-Amerikaner|encyclopedia=Wortschatz|language=de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120193458/http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/cgi-bin/wort_www.exe?site=1&amp;Wort=US-Amerikaner|archivedate=2015-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French ''{{lang|fr|étatsunien}}'',&lt;ref name="french-etatsunien"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://correcteurs.blog.lemonde.fr/2007/07/06/etats-uniens-ou-americains-that-is-the-question/|title=Etats-Uniens ou Américains, that is the question|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=July 6, 2007|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese {{nihongo||米国人|beikokujin}},&lt;ref name="jap-dict-detail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdico.com:8080/kanji/quicks?dbname=kokug&amp;sword=American&amp;stype=1|title=American|work=Online English-Japanese Pictorial Dictionary|publisher=Free Light Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic ''{{transl|ar|amrīkānī}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|أمريكاني}} as opposed to ''{{transl|ar|amrīkī}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|أمريكي}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic-English translation for "أَمْريكيّ"|url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/arabic-english/%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A|website=Bab.la Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=March 2017}} and Italian ''{{lang|it|statunitense}}''.&lt;ref name="dict-it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/statunitense|title=statunitense|work=WordReference English-Italiano Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific terms may be less common than the term ''American''.&lt;ref name="french-etatsunien"/&gt;

In French, ''{{lang|fr|états-unien}}'', ''{{lang|fr|étas-unien}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|étasunien}}'', from ''{{lang|fr|États-Unis d'Amérique}}'' ("United States of America"), is a rarely used word that distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective ''{{lang|fr|américain}}'', which denotes persons and things from the United States, but may also refer to "the Americas".&lt;ref name="french-etatsunien"/&gt;

Likewise, German's use of ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' and ''{{lang|de|U.S.-Amerikaner}}''&lt;ref name="de-dict"/&gt; observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. Note that in normal parlance, the adjective "American" and its direct cognates are usually used if the context renders the nationality of the person clear.

This differentiation is prevalent in German-speaking countries, as indicated by the [[style manual]] of the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (one of the leading German-language newspapers in Switzerland) which dismisses the term ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with ''amerikanisch''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vademecum.

Portuguese has ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'', denoting both a person or thing from the Americas and a U.S. national.&lt;ref name="pt-americano"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa|url=http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/default.aspx?pal=americano|title=americano|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For referring specifically to a U.S. national and things, some words used are ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (also spelled ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'', "United States person"), from ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'', and ''{{lang|pt|ianque}}'' ("Yankee")—both usages exist in Brazil, but are uncommon in Portugal—but the term most often used, and the only one in Portugal, is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'', even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc. as well.

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion.

Conversely, in [[Czech language|Czech]], there is no possibility for disambiguation. ''[[:wiktionary:Američan|Američan]]'' (m.) and ''[[:wiktionary:Američanka|američanka]]'' (f.) can refer to persons from the United States or from the continents of the Americas, and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings. For this reason, the latter meaning is very rarely used, and word ''američan(ka)'' is used almost exclusively to refer to persons from the United States. The usage is exactly parallel to the English word.

[[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] also use unambiguous terms, with Korean having ''{{transl|ko|Migug}}'' ({{lang|ko|미국(인)}}) for the country versus ''{{transl|ko|Amerika}}'' ({{lang|ko|아메리카}}) for the continents,&lt;ref name="ko-dict-america"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enko/america|title=america|work=WordReference English-Korean Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vietnamese having ''{{lang|vi|Hoa Kỳ}}'' for the country versus ''{{lang|vi|Châu Mỹ}}'' for the continents.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has such terms as well (''{{transl|ja|beikoku(jin)}}'' [{{lang|ja|米国(人)}} versus ''{{transl|ja|beishū(jin)}}'' [{{lang|ja|米洲人}}]), but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech, where ''{{transl|ja|amerikajin}}'' predominates.{{efn|name=ja-american}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], ''{{lang|sw|Marekani}}'' means specifically the United States, and ''{{lang|sw|Mwamarekani}}'' is a U.S. national, whereas the international form ''{{lang|sw|Amerika}}'' refers to the continents, and ''{{lang|sw|Mwaamerika}}'' would be an inhabitants thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/united-states|title=United States|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la|access-date=2013-10-27|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131028003031/http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/united-states|archive-date=2013-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiswahili-kiingereza/amerika|title=amerika|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la|access-date=2013-10-27|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131028003013/http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiswahili-kiingereza/amerika|archive-date=2013-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/american|title=American|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la|access-date=2013-10-27|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131028002946/http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/american|archive-date=2013-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In Swahili, adding the prefix ''mwa-'' to a word indicates a person (''wa-'' would indicate people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masai-mara.com/mmsw2.htm|title=Introduction to Swahili|author=Youngman, Jeremy|work=Masai Mara}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Likewise, the [[Esperanto]] word ''{{lang|eo|Ameriko}}'' refers to the continents.

==History==
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban).jpg|thumb|200px|''America'' is named after Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago |work=USA Today |location =Washington, D.C. |date=April 24, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The name ''America'' was coined by [[Martin Waldseemüller]]  from ''Americus Vespucius'', the Latinized version of the name of [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (1454–1512), the Italian explorer who mapped South America's east coast and the [[Caribbean]] Sea in the early 16th century. Later, Vespucci's published letters were the basis of [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller's 1507 map]], which is the first usage of ''America''. The adjective ''American'' subsequently denoted the New World.

16th-century European usage of ''American'' denoted the native inhabitants of the New World.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50007152?query_type=word&amp;queryword=American&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=870u-gw0naW-7329&amp;hilite=50007152|title=American|encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in [[Thomas Hacket]]'s 1568 translation of [[André Thévet]]'s book ''[[France Antarctique]]''; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as ''Ameriques''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; In the following century, the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of "English-American" dates to 1648, in [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]]'s ''The English-American his travail by sea and land: or, a new survey of the West India's''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

In English, ''American'' was used especially for people in the [[British America]].  [[Samuel Johnson]], the leading English lexicographer, wrote in 1775, before the United States declared independence: "That the Americans are able to bear taxation is indubitable."&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of July 1776]] refers to "[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the United States of America" on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_zoom_2.html|title=Declaration of Independence|publisher=National Archives|date=July 4, 1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the country was reaffirmed on November 15, 1777, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which says, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'". The Articles further state:
{{quote|In Witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands in Congress. Done at Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania the ninth day of July in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-Eight, and in the Third Year of the independence of America.}}
[[File:Bowen America.png|thumb|300px|left|British map of the Americas in 1744]]
Sam Haselby, a history professor in Lebanon and Egypt, claims it was British officials who first called the colonists "Americans". When the drafters of the ''Declaration''—[[Thomas Jefferson]] from Virginia, for example, or [[John Adams]] from Massachusetts—talked about "my country", they meant Virginia or Massachusetts, respectively. This situation was changed by the Revolution and the impulse toward nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon S. Wood|Wood, Gordon S.]] (2015), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/jul/09/different-story-what-shaped-america/ "A Different Story of What Shaped America"], ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', July 9 issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, newly elected president in May 1801 wrote, "I am sure the measures I mean to pursue are such as would in their nature be approved by every American who can emerge from preconceived prejudices; as for those who cannot, we must take care of them as of the sick in our hospitals. The medicine of time and fact may cure some of them."&lt;ref&gt;Letter TJ to Theodore Foster, May 1801, in Paul Leicester Ford ed., ''The Works of Thomas Jefferson'' (1905) 8:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' (1787–88), [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] used the adjective ''American'' with two different meanings: one political and one geographic; "the American republic" in [[Federalist No. 51]] and in [[Federalist No. 70]],&lt;ref name=federalist51&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/51|chapter=The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments|title=The Federalist|number=51|author=Madison, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=federalist70&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._70|author=Hamilton, Alexander|chapter=The Executive Department Further Considered|title=The Federalist|number=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[Federalist No. 24]], Hamilton used ''American'' to denote the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders.&lt;ref name=federalist24&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Hamilton | title = The Federalist Papers | number = 24 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/24l | chapter = The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early official U.S. documents show inconsistent usage; the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] with [[France]] used "the United States of North America" in the first sentence, then "the said United States" afterwards; "the United States of America" and "the United States of North America" derive from "the United Colonies of America" and "the United Colonies of North America". The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795, between the United States and the [[Barbary States]] contains the usages "the United States of North America", "citizens of the United States", and "American Citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1795t.asp | title = The Barbary Treaties: Treaty of Peace and Amity}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=October 2013}}

[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|''[[Washington's Farewell Address]]'' (1796)]]
U.S. President [[George Washington]], in his [[Washington's Farewell Address|1796 ''Farewell Address'']], declaimed that "The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Washington's Farewell Address]]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Virginia L. Arbery notes that, in his ''Farewell Address'':&lt;blockquote&gt; "...Washington invites his fellow citizens to view themselves now as Americans who, out of their love for the truth of liberty, have replaced their maiden names (Virginians, South Carolinians, New Yorkers, etc.) with that of “American”. Get rid of, he urges, “any appellation derived from local discriminations.” By defining himself as an American rather than as a Virginian, Washington set the national standard for all citizens. "Over and over, Washington said that America must be something set apart. As he put it to [[Patrick Henry]], 'In a word, I want an ''American'' character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for ''ourselves'' and not for ''others''.'"&lt;ref&gt;Arbery, Virginia L. (1999), "Washington's Farewell Address and the Form of the American Regime"; In: Gary L. Gregg II and Matthew Spalding, ''Patriot Sage: George Washington and the American Political Tradition'', pp. 204, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;As the historian [[Garry Wills]] has noted: "This was a theme dear to Washington. He wrote to [[Timothy Pickering]] that the nation 'must never forget that we are Americans; the remembrance of which will convince us we ought not to be French or English'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1984), ''Cincinnatus: George Washington and the Enlightenment'', pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington's countrymen subsequently embraced his exhortation with notable enthusiasm.

This semantic divergence among North American [[English-speaking world|anglophones]], however, remained largely unknown in the Spanish-American colonies. In 1801, the document titled ''Letter to American Spaniards''—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced [[Venezuela]]'s [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Act of Independence]] and its 1811 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm | title = La "Carta dirigida a los españoles americanos", una carta que recorrió muchos caminos..|trans-title=The "Letter directed to Spanish Americans", a letter that traversed many paths...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127135222/http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2010|author=Bastin, Georges L.

Common short forms and abbreviations are the ''United States'', the ''U.S.'', the ''U.S.A.'', and ''America''; colloquial versions include the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. The term ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' (from the Columbus surname) was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is present today in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]'s name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.

==Usage at the United Nations==
Use of the term ''American'' for U.S. nationals is common at the [[United Nations]], and financial markets in the United States are referred to as "American financial markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2009/090326_GA.doc.htm|title=Financial Reform Recommendations to General Assembly|date=March 26, 2009|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Hispanic America===
The use of ''American'' as a national [[demonym]] for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Hispanic Americans.&lt;ref name="Mencken"/&gt; Spanish speakers in Spain and Latin America use the term ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'' to refer to people and things from the United States (from ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}''), while ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' refers to the [[the Americas|continents]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="rae-americano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rae-estadounidense"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario de la lengua española|title=estadounidense|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=estadounidense|publisher=Real Academia Española|quote=[Translated:] 1. adj.

Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as ''Americans'', though they seldom refer to the United States as ''America''; they use the terms ''the United States'', ''the U.S.'', or (informally) ''the States'' instead.&lt;ref name="oxfcdn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fee, Margery|author2=McAlpine, J.|year=1997|title=Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage|isbn=0-19-541619-8|location=Toronto|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians rarely apply the term ''American'' to themselves – some Canadians resent either being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or others' inability, particularly of those overseas, to distinguish [[Canadian English|Canadian]] from [[American English|American]] [[Accent (dialect)|accents]].&lt;ref name="oxfcdn"/&gt; Some Canadians have protested the use of ''American'' as a national demonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Ford|first=Miriam Allen|date=April 1927|title=On the difficulty of indicating nativity in the United States|journal=American Speech|page=315|doi=10.2307/452894}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as "Other North American origins" by [[Statistics Canada]] for purposes of [[census]] counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo26a-eng.htm|title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census)|publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal and Brazil===
Generally, ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' denotes "U.S. citizen" in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="pt-americano"/&gt; Usage of ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa|Lisbon Academy of Sciences]], because the specific word ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'' (also ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'') clearly denotes a person from the United States. The term currently used by the Portuguese press is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[Brazil]], the term ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' is used to address both that which pertains to both American continents and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.; the particular meaning is deduced from context. Alternatively, the term ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'' ("North American") is also used in more informal contexts, while ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (of the U.S.) is the preferred form in academia. Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media. The term ''{{lang|pt|América}}'' is used almost exclusively for the continents, and the U.S. is called ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos}}'' ("United States") or ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'' ("United States of America"), often abbreviated ''{{lang|pt|EUA}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use "in America" as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Terri |authorlink= |title=Doing business abroad – Brazil |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/oag_11.html |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205081049/http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/oag_11.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
"American" in the 1994 ''[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press Stylebook]]'' was defined as, "An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America." Elsewhere, the ''AP Stylebook'' indicates that "United States" must "be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The entry for "America" in ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' from 1999 reads:
{{quote|[the] terms "America", "American(s)" and "Americas" refer not only to the United States, but to all of North America and South America. They may be used in any of their senses, including references to just the United States, if the context is clear. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are collectively 'the Americas'.}}

Media releases from the [[Pope]] and [[Holy See]] frequently use "America" to refer to the United States, and "American" to denote something or someone from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19651004_yankee-stadium_en.html|title=Homily of the Holy Father Paul VI|location=Yankee Stadium, New York|date=October 4, 1965|authorlink=Pope Paul VI|author=Pope Paul VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International law===
{{synthesis|date=October 2013}}
At least one international law uses ''U.S. citizen'' in defining a citizen of the United States rather than ''American citizen''; for example, the English version of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] includes:
{{quote|Only air carriers that are "citizens of the United States" may operate aircraft in domestic air service (cabotage) and may provide international scheduled and non-scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers...
Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, a "citizen of the United States" means:
:(a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;
:(b) a partnership in which each member is a U.S. citizen; or
:(c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/anx1usa.asp | work = North American Free Trade Agreement|title=Annex I: Reservations for Existing Measures and Liberalization Commitments (Chapters 11, 12, and 14) |date= October 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many international treaties use the terms ''American'' and ''American citizen'':
* 1796 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Dey]] of the Regency of [[Algiers]] on March 7, 1796, protected "American citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/pres_1796mar7.html|title= Treaty between US and the Dey and Regency of Algiers, March 7, 1796|work=Gilder Lehrman Collection Documents|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1806 – The [[Louisiana Purchase Treaty]] between [[France]] and United States referred to "American citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/one/louispur.htm |title=The Louisiana Purchase Treaty|work=Archives of The West|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1825 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Cheyenne]] tribe refers to "American citizen"s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Treaties/TreatyWithTheCheyenneTribe1825.html|title=Treaty with The Cheyenne Tribe|date=July 6, 1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1848 – The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] between [[Mexico]] and the U.S. uses "American Government" to refer to the United States, and "American tribunals" to refer to U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/september21/treaty.htm|title=The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|work=La Prensa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1858 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] between the United States and [[Japan]] protected "American citizens" and also used "American" in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://core.ecu.edu/hist/tuckerjo/harris.html|title=The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the United States and Japan, 1858 (The Harris Treaty)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1898 – The [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Spanish–American War]], known in Spanish as the ''{{lang|es|Guerra Hispano–Estadounidense}}'' ("Spain–United States War") uses "American" in reference to United States troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain; December 10, 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations (Thailand–United States)|United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity]] protects "Americans" and "American corporations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.co.th/006.html|title=The United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity|work=Thailand Business and Legal Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. commercial regulation===
Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as "[[Made in USA label|Made in the USA]]" must be, as set by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), "all or virtually all made in the U.S." The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of "American Made" to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: "The [[FTC Act]] gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|title=Complying with the Made In the USA Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216200917/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2006|publisher=Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{Main article|Names for United States citizens}}
There are a number of alternatives to the [[demonym]] ''American'' as a citizen of the United States that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is ''[[Usonian]]'', which usually describes a certain style of residential [[architecture]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have fallen into disuse and obscurity. ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary of English Usage'' says:
{{quote|The list contains (in approximate historical order from 1789 to 1939) such terms as Columbian, Columbard, Fredonian, Frede, Unisian, United Statesian, Colonican, Appalacian, Usian, Washingtonian, Usonian, Uessian, U-S-ian, Uesican, United Stater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=88|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nevertheless, no alternative to ''American'' is common.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

An '''anaesthetic machine''' ([[British English]]) or '''anesthesia machine''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|see spelling differences]]) is a [[medical device]] used to generate a [[fresh gas flow]] of medical gases and [[inhalational anaesthetic]] agents for the purpose of inducing and maintaining [[anaesthesia]]. The machine is commonly used together with a [[mechanical ventilator]], [[breathing circuit|breathing system]], [[suction (medicine)|suction equipment]], and [[Medical monitor|patient monitoring]] devices; modern anaesthetic machines usually integrate all these devices into one combined freestanding unit, which is often colloquially referred to as the "anaesthetic machine" for the sake of simplicity.

In the developed world, the most frequent type of anaesthetic machine in use is the '''continuous-flow anaesthetic machine''' or "'''Boyle's machine'''", which is designed to provide an accurate supply of medical gases mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour, and to deliver this continuously to the patient at a safe [[pressure]] and flow. This is distinct from '''intermittent-flow anaesthetic machines''', which provide gas flow only on demand when triggered by the patient's own inspiration.

Simpler anaesthetic apparatus may be used in special circumstances, such as the [[Triservice anaesthetic apparatus]], a simplified anaesthesia delivery system invented for the British [[Defence Medical Services]], which is light and portable and may be used effectively even when no medical gases are available. This device has unidirectional valves which suck in ambient air, which can be enriched with oxygen from a cylinder, with the help of a set of bellows. A large number of draw-over type of anaesthesia devices are still in use in India for administering an air-ether mixture to the patient, which can be enriched with oxygen.

==History==
The original concept of continuous-flow machines was popularised by Boyle's anaesthetic machine, invented by the British anaesthetist [[Henry Edmund Gaskin Boyle|Henry Boyle]] at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] in 1917, although similar machines had been in use in France and the United States.&lt;ref name="YentisHirsch2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven M. Yentis|author2=Nicholas P. Hirsch|author3=James K. Ip|title=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care A-Z: An Encyclopaedia of Principles and Practice|chapter=Anaesthetic machine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_W-55fYDyAC|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7020-4420-2|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this time, anaesthesiologists often carried all their equipment with them, but the development of heavy, bulky cylinder storage and increasingly elaborate airway equipment meant that this was no longer practical for most circumstances. Contemporary anaesthetic machines are sometimes still referred to [[metonym]]ously as "Boyle's machine", and are usually mounted on anti-static wheels for convenient transportation.

Many of the early innovations in anaesthetic equipmentin the United States, including the closed circuit carbon-dioxide absorber (a.k.a. the Guedel-Foregger Midget) and diffusion of such equipment to anaesthesiologists within the United States can be attributed to [[Richard von Foregger]] and [[The Foregger Company]].

==Components of a typical machine==
[[Image:anesthesia machine simple schm.png|thumb|Simple schematic of an anaesthetic machine]]

A modern anaesthetic machine includes at minimum the following components:&lt;ref name="YentisHirsch2013"/&gt;
* Connections to piped [[oxygen]], [[medical air]], and [[nitrous oxide]] from a wall supply in the healthcare facility, or reserve [[gas cylinder]]s of oxygen, air, and nitrous oxide attached via a specific yoke with a [[Bodok seal]]
* Pressure gauges, regulators and 'pop-off' valves, to monitor gas pressure troughout the system and protect the machine components and patient from excessive rises
* [[Flowmeters]] such as [[rotameter]]s for oxygen, air, and nitrous oxide
* [[Anaesthetic vaporiser|Vaporiser]]s to provide accurate dosage control when using volatile anaesthetics
* A high-flow oxygen flush, which bypasses the flowmeters and vaporisers to provide pure oxygen at 30-75 litres/minute
* Systems for monitoring the gases being administered to, and exhaled by, the patient, including an [[oxygen failure warning device]]
Systems for monitoring the patient's [[heart rate]], [[Electrocardiography|ECG]], [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure]] and [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|oxygen saturation]] may be incorporated, in some cases with additional options for monitoring [[Capnography|end-tidal carbon dioxide]] and [[temperature]].&lt;ref name="YentisHirsch2013"/&gt; [[Ventilator|Breathing systems]] are also typically incorporated, including a manual [[reservoir bag]] for ventilation in combination with an [[adjustable pressure-limiting valve]], as well as an integrated mechanical ventilator, to accurately ventilate the patient during anaesthesia.&lt;ref name="YentisHirsch2013"/&gt;

Anaesthetic machines are distinct from [[anesthesia cart|anaesthesia carts]], which hold various adjuncts for anaesthesia such as intravenous medications, syringes, needles and other items of equipment that the healthcare worker providing anaesthesia might need.

In [[dentistry]] a simplified version of the anaesthetic machine, without a ventilator or anaesthetic vaporiser, is referred to as a [[relative analgesia machine]]. By using this machine, the dentist can administer a mild inhalation [[sedation]] with [[nitrous oxide]] and [[oxygen]], in order to keep their patient in a conscious state while depressing the feeling of pain.

==Safety features of modern machines==
Based on experience gained from analysis of mishaps, the modern anaesthetic machine incorporates several safety devices, including:
* an oxygen failure alarm (a.k.a. 'Oxygen Failure Warning Device' or OFWD). In older machines this was a pneumatic device called a Ritchie whistle which sounds when oxygen pressure is 38 psi descending. Newer machines have an electronic sensor.
* Nitrous cut-off or oxygen failure protection device, OFPD: the flow of medical nitrous-oxide is dependent on oxygen pressure. This is done at the regulator level. In essence, the nitrous-oxide regulator is a 'slave' of the oxygen regulator. i.e., if oxygen pressure is lost then the other gases can not flow past their regulator
* [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]]-mixture alarms (hypoxy guards or ratio controllers) to prevent gas mixtures which contain less than 21-25% oxygen being delivered to the patient. In modern machines it is impossible to deliver 100% nitrous oxide (or any hypoxic mixture) to the patient to breathe. Oxygen is automatically added to the fresh gas flow even if the anaesthesiologist should attempt to deliver 100% nitrous oxide. Ratio controllers usually operate on the pneumatic principle or are chain linked (link 25 system). Both are located on the rotameter assembly, unless electronically controlled.
* ventilator alarms, which warn of low or high airway pressures.
* interlocks between the vaporizers preventing inadvertent administration of more than one volatile agent concurrently
* alarms on all the above physiological monitors
* the [[Pin Index Safety System]] prevents cylinders being accidentally connected to the wrong yoke
* the NIST (Non-Interchangeable Screw Thread) or Diameter Index Safety System, DISS system for pipeline gases, which prevents piped gases from the wall being accidentally connected to the wrong inlet on the machine
* pipeline gas hoses have non-interchangeable [[Schrader valve]] connectors, which prevents hoses being accidentally plugged into the wrong wall socket

The functions of the machine should be checked at the beginning of every operating list in a "cockpit-drill". Machines and associated equipment must be maintained and serviced regularly.

Older machines may lack some of the safety features and refinements present on newer machines. However, they were designed to be operated without [[mains electricity]], using compressed gas power for the ventilator and suction apparatus. Modern machines often have [[battery (electricity)|battery]] backup, but may fail when this becomes depleted.

The modern anaesthetic machine still retains all the key working principles of the Boyle's machine (a [[The BOC Group|British Oxygen Company]] trade name) in honour of the British anaesthetist Henry Boyle. In India, however, the trade name 'Boyle' is registered with Boyle HealthCare Pvt. Ltd., Indore MP.

A two-person pre-use check (consisting of an anaesthesiologist and an assistant) of the anaesthetic machine is recommended before every single case and has been shown to decrease the risk of 24-hour severe postoperative morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name=Arbous&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arbous|journal=Anesthesiology|year=2005|volume=102|doi=10.1097/00000542-200502000-00005|pmid=15681938|issue=2|title=Impact of anesthesia management characteristics on severe morbidity and mortality|pages=257–68; quiz 491–2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various regulatory and professional bodies have formulated checklists for different countries.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;http://vam.anest.ufl.edu/guidelines.html&lt;/ref&gt; A free transparent reality simulation of the checklist recommended by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration is available from the Virtual Anesthesia Machine web site ( see below) after registration which is also free.

Commenting in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion, Tõnno Jonuks wrote "Despite stressing the importance of archaeology and using its sources to a greater extent than any other school in the Baltic countries, studies of archaeo-mythology are still based upon folklore and archaeology has only been used selectively. The greater part of archaeological material which could not be reconciled with folklore has been left out and many phenomena of past religions have thus not been discussed as they cannot be compared with folklore."&lt;ref name=Jonuks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonuks|first1=Tõnno|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199232444|page=882|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SgLxGuvnezUC&amp;pg=PA882&amp;dq=Archaeomythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjctteLxuLIAhUGthoKHcnkAic#v=onepage&amp;q=Archaeomythology&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7364">An '''article''' is a [[written work]] published in a [[Publishing|print]] or [[electronic media|electronic]] medium. It may be for the purpose of propagating news, research results, academic analysis, or debate.

==News articles==
{{See also|News style}}
A '''news article''' discusses current or recent news of either general interest (i.e. daily [[newspaper]]s) or of a specific topic (i.e. political or trade news [[magazine]]s, club newsletters, or technology news websites).

A news article can include accounts of eyewitnesses to the happening event. It can contain photographs, accounts, statistics, graphs, recollections, interviews, polls, debates on the topic, etc. Headlines can be used to focus the reader’s attention on a particular (or main) part of the article. The writer can also give facts and detailed information following answers to general questions like [[Five Ws|who, what, when, where, why and how]].

Quoted references can also be helpful. References to people can also be made through the written accounts of interviews and debates confirming the factuality of the writer’s information and the reliability of his source. The writer can use redirection to ensure that the reader keeps reading the article and to draw her attention to other articles. For example, phrases like "Continued on page 3” redirect the reader to a page where the article is continued.

While a good conclusion is an important ingredient for newspaper articles, the immediacy of a deadline environment means that [[copy editing]] often takes the form of deleting everything past an arbitrary point in the story corresponding to the dictates of available space on a page. Therefore, newspaper reporters are trained to write in [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] style, with all the most important information in the first paragraph or two. If the less vital details are pushed towards the end of the story, then the potentially destructive impact of draconian copy editing will be minimized.

===Elements of a news article===

====Headline====
A '''[[headline]]''' is text above a newspaper article, indicating its topic. The headline catches the attention of the reader and relates well to the topic. Modern headlines are typically written in an abbreviated style omitting many elements of a complete sentence and almost always including a non-copular verb.

====Byline====
A '''[[byline]]''' gives the name and often the position of the writer, along with the date.

====Lead====
The [[Lead paragraph|lead]] (sometimes spelled ''lede'') [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] captures the attention of the reader and sums up the focus of the story. The lead also establishes the subject, sets the tone and guides reader into the article.&lt;ref name="jaco"&gt;Jacobi, Peter, ''The Magazine Article: How to Think It, Plan It, Write It.'' Writer's Digest Books: 1991, {{ISBN|0-89879-450-1}}, pp. 50-77, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news story, the introductory paragraph includes the most important facts and answers the questions: ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'' and'' how''. In a featured story, the author may choose to open in any number of ways, often using a [[narrative hook]], possibly one of the following:&lt;ref name="polk"&gt;Polking, Kirk, ''Writing A to Z.'' Writer's Digest Books: 1990. {{ISBN|0-89879-556-7}}, pp. 136, 143, 224, 422, 497&lt;/ref&gt;
an [[anecdote]], a shocking or [[startle|startling]] statement, a [[generalization]], pure [[information]], a [[description]], a [[Quotation|quote]], a [[question]] or a comparison.
 
====Body or running text====
For the news story, details and elaboration are evident in the body or running text of the news story and flow smoothly from the lead. Quotes are used to add interest and support to the story. Most news stories are structured using what is called an inverted pyramid. The ''angle'' (also called a ''hook'' or ''peg'') is usually the most newsworthy aspect of the story and is specifically highlighted and elaborated upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/glossary.html|title=The News Manual - Glossary|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A featured article will follow a format appropriate for its type. Structures for featured articles may include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref name="jaco" /&gt;
* ''chronological'', where the article may be a narrative of some sort;
* ''cause and effect'', where the reasons and results of an event or process are examined;
* ''classification'', where items in an article are grouped to help aid understanding;
* ''compare and contrast'', where two or more items are examined side-by-side to show similarities and differences;
* ''list'', a simple item-by-item run-down of pieces of information;
* ''question and answer'', such as an interview with a celebrity or reybel
 
====Conclusion====
The conclusion will sum up the article, possibly including a final quote, a descriptive scene, a play on the title or lead, a summary statement, or the writer's opinion. Make the conclusion attention-grabbing.

===Characteristics of well-written news articles===
The article is usually on a well-defined topic or topics that are related in some way, such as a factual account of a newsworthy event.
The writer of a well-written article is seen as objective and showing all sides to an issue.
The sources for a news story should be identified and reliable.
The technique of [[show, don't tell]] is applied.

===Authorship===
Publications obtain articles in a few different ways:
* '''staff written''' &amp;ndash; an article may be written by a person on the staff of the publication.
* '''assigned''' &amp;ndash; a [[Freelancer|freelance]] writer may be asked to write an article on a specific topic.
* '''unsolicited''' &amp;ndash; a publication may be open to receiving article [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscripts]] from freelance writers. {{See also|Slush pile}}

==Other types of articles==
* '''[[Academic paper]]''' &amp;ndash; an article published in an [[academic journal]]. The status of academics is often dependent both on how many articles they have had published and on the number of times that their articles are cited by authors of other articles.
* '''[[Essay]]''' some overlap with academic paper.
* '''[[Scientific paper]]''' &amp;ndash; an article published in a [[scientific journal]].
* '''[[Blogging|Blog]]''' &amp;ndash; some blog articles are like magazine or newspaper articles; others are written more like entries in a [[personal journal]].
* '''[[Encyclopedia article]]''' &amp;ndash; in an encyclopedia or other reference work, an ''article'' is a primary division of content.
* '''[[Article marketing|Marketing article]]''' &amp;ndash; an often thin piece of content which is designed to draw the reader to a commercial website or product.
* '''[[Usenet|Usenet article]]''' &amp;ndash; a message written in the style of e-mail and posted to an open moderated or unmoderated Usenet newsgroup.
* '''Spoken article''' &amp;ndash; an article produced in the form of an [[audio recording]], also referred to as a [[podcast]].
* '''[[Listicle]]''' &amp;ndash; an article whose primary content is a list.
* '''[[Portrait]]''' &amp;ndash; a portrait of a person (article).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">'''Belize National Dance Company''' (also known as the '''Belize Dance Company''') is a Belizean cultural preservation organization which strives to represent [[Belize]] and its many ethnic groups in classical, contemporary and traditional folk dancing. 

==History==
In October 1990, the Belize National Dance Company was founded by a group of dancers which included [[Rosita Baltazar]], Eleanor Bodden-Gillett, Joel Cayetano, Lydia Harris (now Thurton), Bernard Matute, Matthew Martinez, Liza Pagayo, Rodney Peck, Sharette Perotte, Norman Rodriguez, [[Althea Sealy]] and Ramon Vargas.{{sfn|Ramos|2015}} Initially, their trainer was Cuban professor Edwardo Rivero, who came to Belize to help teach ballet and contemporary styles. The company incorporated local folk dancing into their performance pieces, which represent the major ethnic groups of the country{{sfn|Humes|2015}} including [[Caribbean]],{{sfn|Parks|2014}} [[Afro-Belizean|Creole]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]],{{sfn|Heusner|2005}} [[Hispanic Belizean]], [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] and [[Middle Eastern]] folk dances.{{sfn|Parks|2014}}

Since 2010, the Company's Managing Director has been Denese Enriquez, artistic director is Althea Sealy, and for many years the assistant artistic director and director of junior branches was Rosita Baltazar.{{sfn|Humes|2015}} In 1998, the San Pedro Dance Company {{sfn|''San Pedro Sun''|12/1998}} followed two years later by The Caye Caulker Dance Company were formed as junior dance organizations. {{sfn|''Conch Telegraph''|2000}} 

The initial group of 16 dancers expanded to around 80 dancers{{sfn|Humes|2015}} and has traveled throughout the world including performances in the [[Caribbean]], [[Costa Rica]],{{sfn|Heusner|2005}} [[France]], [[Malaysia]],{{sfn|''7 News Belize''|2005}} [[Mexico]],{{sfn|Heusner|2005}} [[Spain]]{{sfn|''7 News Belize''|2005}} and the United States.{{sfn|Heusner|2005}} They present two annual performances in Belize one around the time of the Company's anniversary and one around the time of Spring break, typically allowing six months of preparation between performances. As well as performing, the Company is a school of dance,{{sfn|Parks|2014}} and dancers also choreograph routines for other cultural events throughout the country.{{sfn|''San Pedro Sun''|8/2015}}

'''Bishapur''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''Bay-Šāpūr''; {{lang-fa|بیشاپور|}}, ''Bishâpûr'') was an ancient city in [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persia]] ([[Iran]]) on the ancient road between [[Persis]] and [[Elam]]. The road linked the [[Sassanid]] capitals [[Estakhr]] (very close to [[Persepolis]]) and [[Ctesiphon]]. It is located south of modern [[Faliyan]] in the [[Kazerun County]] of [[Pars Province]], [[Iran]].

Bishapur was built near a river crossing and at the same site there is also a fort with rock-cut reservoirs and a river valley with six Sassanid [[rock relief]]s.

The most important point about this city, is the combination of Persian and Roman art and architecture that hadn't been seen before Bishapur construction. Before Bishapour was built, almost all the main cities in Persia/Iran had a circular shape like the old city in [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] or [[Darab]].  Bishapour is the first city with vertical and horizontal streets also in the city specially in interior design we can see tile work that's adapted from [[Roman art|Roman Art]]  

== History ==

[[File:Bishapur by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Bishapur in 1840; a painting by [[Eugène Flandin]] in the book "Travel in Persia" (''Voyage en Perse'')]]
[[File:Bishapour jarres.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Jarres discovered in Bishapur]]

The name ''Bishapur'' derives from ''Bay-Šāpūr'', which means ''Lord Shapur''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bisapur-town&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an inscription, the city itself was founded in 266 AD by [[Shapur I]] (241-272), who was the second Sassanid king and inflicted a triple defeat on the Romans, having killed [[Gordian III]], captured [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and forced [[Philip the Arab]] to surrender. In his native province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], he built a new capital that would measure up to his ambitions: Bishapur, ''Shapur's City''. Outside the city, Shapur decorated the sides of the Bishapur River gorge with huge historical relief commemorating his triple triumph over Rome. One of these reliefs, in a semicircular shape, has rows of registers with files of soldiers and horses, in a deliberate imitation of the narrative scenes on the [[Trajan]] column in Rome. 

At Bishapur the king also inaugurated the Sassanid imagery of the king's investiture, which would be copied by his successors: the king and the god are face to face, often on horseback, and the god - usually [[Ahura Mazda]] - is holding the royal diadem out to the sovereign.

The city, has the remarkable [[Band-e Kaisar|dam bridge in Shushtar]], built by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers who had been captured after [[Battle of Edessa|Valerian's defeat]] in 260. However, it was not a completely new settlement: archaeologists have found remains from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Elamite Kingdom|Elamite]] ages.

The city remained important until the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] the rise of Islam in the second quarter of the 7th century AD. There were still people living there in the 10th century.

The city has a rectangular plan with a grid pattern of regular intra urban streets, resembling [[Ancient_Roman_architecture#City_design|Roman city design]]. This design was never repeated in the [[architecture of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salma |first1=K. Jayyusi|last2=Holod|first2=Renata|last3=Petruccioli|first3=Attilio|last4=André|first4=Raymond|title=The City in the Islamic World|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004162402|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations and Research==
The site was cleared by the Russian-French archaeologist [[Roman Ghirshman]] in the 1930s. The British archaeologist [[Georgina Herrmann]] has also written a book about the Sasanian rock reliefs in Bishapur which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/sasanian-rock-reliefs-at-bishapur-part-1-bishapur-iii-triumph-attributed-to-shapur-i/oclc/59815517&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decoration ==
[[File:Mosaic01.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Persian-Roman floor mosaic detail from the palace of [[Shapur I]] at Bishapur. Now this tile work is in [[National Museum of Iran]]]]
The main part of the excavations took place in the royal sector, in the east of the city. A water temple, interpreted as a  [[Anahita|Anahita temple]] , was erected near the palace. In the center there is a cross-shaped space with eight large square exedrae decorated with 64 alcoves. The French excavators believed it had been covered with a dome roof, but this reconstruction has been rejected. To the west lies a courtyard decorated with mosaics; to the east, a square iwan used as a reception room. Its walls must have been covered with small stucco ornaments: rows of medallions, bands of foliage, and topped with merlons inherited from Achaemenid architecture. All these decorative techniques were still used after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].

The floor was paved with black marble slabs, with a mosaic border. Along the walls runs a narrow band featuring a series of heads and masks, in a frontal or profile view, on a white background. At the top of each alcove there was a picture of women naked under their transparent veils: courtesans, musicians, dancers, women twisting garlands, together with a few richly attired noble ladies.

'''''Blubber''''' is a [[young adult literature|young adult]] novel by [[Judy Blume]] first published in [[1974 in literature|1974]]. The narrator of the story is Jill Brenner, a [[Pennsylvania]] fifth-grader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=9780440407072&amp;z=y. |title=Books: Blubber, by Judy Blume, Paperback |accessdate=2007-02-02 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joins her classmates in ostracizing and [[bullying]] Linda, an awkward and [[overweight]] girl. Linda gives an oral class report about [[whales]] and is hence nicknamed "[[Blubber]]" by her peers.

==Plot==
The story takes place in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]].

The entire class ostracizes Linda and, though she is not the heaviest student in their class, Wendy and her best friend and sidekick Caroline are Linda's chief tormentors and bully her both physically (e.g., attempting to strip her in the girls' bathroom) and psychologically (forcing her to say things such as "I am Blubber, the Smelly Whale of Class 206"). As a member of Wendy's clique, Jill participates in the bullying without remorse, though Wendy and Caroline are usually the instigators. Linda confronts Jill and threatens her with revenge after one incident, but Jill dismisses the threat, confident of her status and protection as one of Wendy's circle.

Jill and her friend Tracy play a [[practical joke|prank]] on their grouch of a neighbor, Mr. Machinist, on [[Halloween]], stuffing raw rotten eggs into his mailbox, but are later identified from a photo taken by Mr. Machinist and are made to rake the leaves in his backyard as punishment. While raking, Jill and Tracy find they need to use the restroom. They urinate all over Mr. Machinist's trees as a sort of payback.

Remembering Linda's threat, Jill suspects that "Blubber" was the one who tattled on her and Tracy; Tracy, however, suspects Wendy and Caroline, which infuriates Wendy. To appease Wendy, Jill suggests that the class hold a [[kangaroo court|mock trial]] for Linda (with Wendy, naturally, as judge, and a jury made up of several classmates). To this suggestion, Tracy remarks that she thinks Jill is scared of Wendy. Jill soon realizes that Tracy is right.

The "trial" falls apart when Wendy, as judge, denies Linda her right to a "lawyer", and Jill, frustrated with herself for so readily following Wendy's lead, finally stands up to Wendy, who also arouses Jill's anger by making a racial slur against Tracy, who is Chinese-American. Linda, who'd had been locked in the classroom closet, is set free by Jill. Wendy, furious that Jill has dared to question her authority, threatens to make Jill "sorry [she was] ever born".

Jill comes to school the next morning to find that Wendy has made good on her threat and turned the entire class against her, tagging her with the nickname "B. B." (short for "Baby Brenner"). Jill's tormentors include Linda, who has joined with Wendy and is more than willing to bully one of her former harassers.

Jill believes that she can be stronger by playing into the jokes. However, when she tries to laugh at their taunting, they even use that to make fun of her. Instead, Jill goes further to fight against the bullying by setting Wendy, Linda, and Wendy's best friend Caroline against each other, telling Caroline she should make her own decisions and that she is no longer Wendy's best friend, that Linda has taken her place, which Linda affirms. Caroline is hurt and Wendy is furious at Linda. Jill makes friends with Rochelle, a quiet girl in the class who had never participated in the bullying.

By the end, although the class atmosphere is tense, no one is being singled out or picked on. Jill comments (the book is in a first-person narrative) on how the friendships in the class have changed completely in the classroom but how Tracy is a friend she can always count on having.

==Characters==
'''Jill Brenner''' — The main character in the book. She goes to Hillside School, a school for fifth and sixth graders. She is shown to be average, and she is one of the many people in the class who bullies Linda. She is best friends with Tracy Wu, and becomes friends with Wendy and Caroline, but the friendship ends abruptly when she dares to challenge Wendy's authority. Also, at the end of the book she becomes good friends with a new girl in her class named Rochelle. Unlike many of Judy Blume's main characters, Jill has a mean nature and is quite cruel in her taunting, though she chiefly follows Wendy and Caroline's lead. She is in Mrs. Minish's fifth grade class. Like all the other students in the class, Jill calls Linda "Blubber". She dresses as a [[flenser]] for Halloween, instead of being a witch like she was for the last three years. Her chief hobby is [[stamp collecting]], and she has problems with math.

'''Wendy''' — The [[class president]] of Jill's class. She is an excellent student, smart, popular, and powerful, but uses her power to bully others and control her classmates. She is best friends with Caroline for most of the book but near the end of the book becomes best friends with Linda. At the very end she ends up becoming best friends with Laurie. She likes salami a lot, so she always trades lunches with Caroline. In addition, Wendy is manipulative and an excellent liar. She nicknames Linda "Blubber", because Linda presented a report on the whale and she is large-bodied. She lives in Hidden Valley with Caroline, Robby, and Linda. She has never been in the same class as Jill, Donna, Bruce, or Robby before this year.

'''Caroline''' — Another classmate of Jill's. She is Wendy's best friend and her sidekick in bullying Linda. She always does what Wendy says, and seems to be a little bit afraid of her. Caroline always backs up what Wendy says. She loves tuna fish sandwiches, so she trades lunches with Wendy every day. She calls Linda "Blubber," like almost everybody else in the class. She lives in Hidden Valley with Wendy, Robby, and Linda. Near the end of the book, Caroline becomes best friends with Donna Davidson. She has never been in the same class as Jill, Donna, Bruce, or Robby before this year.

'''Linda Fischer''' — A girl in Jill's class who is nicknamed "Blubber," since she did a report on whale's fat (blubber) and is full-figured and plain. She also is very submissive and does not know how to defend or assert herself. Near the end of the book, she becomes best friends with Wendy, but by the end, she is a loner again. She lives in Hidden Valley with Wendy, Caroline, and Robby. This is the second year she has been in Jill, Donna, Robby, and Bruce's class.

'''Kenny Brenner''' — Jill's younger brother. He is in fourth grade at Longmeadow School. He wins the Halloween contest for the most original costume, because he dresses as a witch, but with a cigar, and yellow goggles. He always recites facts from his ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' and often annoys Jill.

'''Tracy Wu''' — Jill's next-door neighbor and best friend. She is a [[Chinese-American]], and a stamp collector, like Jill. She and her family own a lot of animals. Her Halloween costumer was [[Big Bird]], and as a result won a prize for the Most Beautiful Costume. She is in a different fifth grade class, and has a much better teacher who is always thinking up fun ways for his students to learn.

'''Gordon Brenner''' — Jill and Kenny's father. He works as a tax accountant for a living.

'''Ann Brenner''' — Jill and Kenny's mother. She is trying to stop smoking cigarettes. She can blow very big chewing gum bubbles. She swears around the house often, and is okay with her kids doing it, as long as they know that there are some people who don't approve of those words. Her job involves working with computers.

'''Rochelle''' — A new girl in school. She is the only one who tried to defend Linda. In the end she becomes friends with Jill.

'''Donna Davidson''' — A girl in Jill's class. She likes horses and dresses as a horse for Halloween every year except for this year, when she is a [[jockey]]. She has been in the same class as Jill, Bruce, and Robby since kindergarten; this is her second year with Linda and her first year with Wendy and Caroline. In the end she becomes best friends with Caroline.

'''Robby Winters''' — A student in Jill's class. He has been in Donna, Bruce, and Jill's class since kindergarten.

'''Bruce Bonaventura''' — A boy in Jill's class. He is the fattest kid in the grade. He has been in the same class as Jill, Donna and Robby since kindergarten, this is his second year with Linda, and his first year with Wendy and Caroline.

'''Mr. Machinist''' — A mean man who lives in Hidden Valley. He reports Jill and Tracy to their parents for putting rotten eggs in his mailbox on Halloween. He always turns the hose on kids who venture onto his property.

'''Warren Winkler''' — A boy who is the son of Gordon's friend. He is [[Jew]]ish. Jill and her family attend his [[bar mitzvah]], as do Linda and her family. He can read [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] perfectly. Jill dislikes him.

'''Mrs. Sandmeier''' - The Brenner family's [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born housekeeper and nanny to Jill and Kenny. She is trilingual (part of her job is to teach Jill and Kenny to speak [[French language|French]]) and an excellent cook.

'''Great Maudie''' - Jill and Kenny's great-aunt who moves in as nanny to the children while Mrs. Sandmeier is on vacation. She is a [[hippie]] who practices [[yoga]] and forces health foods like "[[wheat germ]] mush" on the children.

'''Mrs. Minish''' — Jill's very strict fifth grade teacher.

'''Irwin''' — Jill's classmate. Catches Linda during the "Blubber Trial" when Linda tried to escape.

==Judy Blume on ''Blubber''==
According to Judy Blume in a short essay published in a recent reprint of the novel{{fact|date=November 2018}}, the plot of ''Blubber'' was inspired by a very similar real-life incident involving her daughter's 5th grade class, in which one girl was singled out for torment by the class leader, who led her classmates in bullying her. "My daughter was the shy, quiet girl in the class, the observer, like Rochelle," Blume wrote. "She was upset by what was going on, but she didn't know what to do about it. She was scared. Like many other kids in that class, she worried she could wind up the next victim of the bullying." Blume also explained that she wrote ''Blubber'' to encourage children who see bullying taking place, as well as the bullies' victims themselves, to tell someone they trust rather than keep it to themselves.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

'''Botanical illustration''' is the art of depicting the form, color, and details of plant species, frequently in [[watercolor]] paintings.  They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in books, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sydney Living Museums|title=The art in the illustration|date=2016-07-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGxHTUgcYv0|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of [[plant morphology]] and access to specimens and references.

==History==
Early [[herbals]] and [[pharmacopoeia]] of many cultures have included the depiction of plants. This was intended to assist identification of a species, usually with some medicinal purpose. The earliest surviving illustrated botanical work is the Codex vindobonensis. It is a copy of [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', and was made in the year 512 for Juliana Anicia, daughter of the former Western Roman Emperor Olybrius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |title=Kew Gardens website |access-date=2011-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102005902/http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |archive-date=2011-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of accurately describing plants between regions and languages, before the introduction of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], were potentially hazardous to medicinal preparations. The low quality of printing of early works sometimes presents difficulties in identifying the species depicted.   

When systems of [[botanical nomenclature]] began to be published, the need for a drawing or painting became optional.  However, it was at this time that the  profession of [[botanical illustrator]] began to emerge. The eighteenth century saw many advances in the printing processes, and the [[illustration]]s became more accurate in colour and detail. The increasing interest of amateur botanists, gardeners, and natural historians provided a market for botanical publications; the illustrations increased the appeal and accessibility of these to the general reader.
The field guides, [[Flora]]s, catalogues and magazines produced since this time have continued to include illustrations.  The development of photographic plates has not made illustration obsolete, despite the improvements in reproducing photographs in printed materials.  A botanical illustrator is able to create a compromise of accuracy, an idealized image from several specimens, and the inclusion of the face and reverse of the features such as leaves. Additionally, details of sections can be given at a magnified scale and included around the margins around the image.

[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]]. ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'', early sixth century]]

Botanical illustration is a feature of many notable books on plants, a list of these would include: 
*[[Vienna Dioscurides]]
*''[[Flora Graeca]]''
*''[[The Banksias]]''
*''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''
*''[[The Cactaceae]]''

Recently a renaissance has been occurring in botanical art and illustration. Organizations devoted to furthering the art form are found in the US ([[American Society of Botanical Artists]]), UK (Society of Botanical Artists), Australia (Botanical Art Society of Australia), and South Africa (Botanical Artists Association of South Africa), among others. The reasons for this resurgence are many. In addition to the need for clear scientific illustration, botanical depictions continue to be one of the most popular forms of "wall art". There is an increasing interest in the changes occurring in the natural world, and in the central role plants play in maintaining healthy ecosystems. A sense of urgency has developed in recording today's changing plant life for future generations. Working in media long understood provides confidence in the long-term conservation of the drawings, paintings, and etchings. 
Many artists are drawn to more traditional figurative work, and find plant depiction a perfect fit. Working with scientists, conservationists, horticulturists, and galleries locally and around the world, today's illustrators and artists are pushing the boundaries of what has traditionally been considered part of the genre.

{{Human history}}

'''Classical antiquity''' (also the '''classical era''', '''classical period''' or '''classical age''') is the period of cultural [[history]] between the 8th century BC and the 5th or 6th century AD centered on the [[Mediterranean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;For more detail on the end dates used by historians, see [[Middle Ages#Terminology and periodisation]]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[Western Asia]].

Conventionally, it is taken to begin with the earliest-recorded [[Epic Greek]] poetry of [[Homer]] (8th–7th century&amp;nbsp;BC), and continues through the [[Origins of Christianity|emergence of Christianity]] and the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] (5th century&amp;nbsp;AD). It ends with the dissolution of classical culture at the close of [[Late Antiquity]] (300–600), blending into the [[Early Middle Ages]] (600–1000). Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. ''Classical antiquity'' may refer also to an idealised vision among later people of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, "the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome."&lt;ref&gt;Poe EA (1831). "[[To Helen]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[culture]] of the [[ancient]] [[Greeks]], together with some influences from the [[ancient Near East]], was the basis of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Helga von Heintze|de|vertical-align=sup}}: Römische Kunst (''Roman art''). In: [[Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt]] (1960): Bildende Kunst I (Archäologie) (''Visual arts&amp;nbsp;I — archaeology''). {{Interlanguage link multi|Das Fischer Lexikon|de|vertical-align=sup}}. [[S. Fischer Verlag]]. p.&amp;nbsp;192. "Bestimmend blieb (...) der italisch-römische Geist, der sich der entlehnten Formen nur bediente. (...) Ohne [die] Begegnung [mit der griechischen Formenwelt, author's note] hätte der italisch-römische Geist sich wohl kaum in künstlerischen Schöpfungen ausdrücken können und wäre nicht über die Ansätze, die wir in den ''Kanopen von Chiusi'' (...), der ''kapitolinischen Wölfin'' (...), dem ''Krieger von Capestrano'' (...) erhalten haben, hinausgekommen. Auch die gleichermaßen realistische wie unkünstlerische Auffassung der ''Porträts'' im 2. und 1. J[ahr]h[undert] v[or] Chr[istus] konnte sich nur unter dem Einfluß griechischer Formen ändern." (''"Determinant remained the Italic-Roman spirit, that just availed itself of the borrowed forms. (...) Without having come across [the world of the Greek forms], the Italic-Roman spirit would hardly have been able to express itself in works of art and would not have got beyond the starts that are preserved in the canopic jars of Chiusi, the Capitoline Wolf, the Warrior of Capestrano. Also the likewise realistic and inartistic conception and production of the portraits in the second and the first centuries&amp;nbsp;BC could only change under the influence of Greek forms."'')&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy, society, and educational ideals, until the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]]. The Romans preserved, imitated and [[Campaign history of the Roman military|spread over Europe]] these ideals until they were able to competitively rival the Greek culture, as the [[Latin]] language became widespread and the classical world became bilingual, Greek and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Der Große Brockhaus]]. 1. vol.: A-Beo. Eberhard Brockhaus, Wiesbaden 1953, p.&amp;nbsp;315. "Ihre dankbarsten und verständnisvollsten Schüler aber fand die hellenistische Kultur in den Römern; sie wurden Mäzene, Nachahmer und schließlich Konkurrenten, indem sie die eigene Sprache wetteifernd neben die griechische setzten: so wurde die antike Kultur zweisprachig, griechisch und lateinisch. Das System dieser griechisch-hellenistisch-römischen Kultur, das sich in der römischen Kaiserzeit abschließend gestaltete, enthielt, neben Elementen des Orients, die griechische Wissenschaft und Philosophie, Dichtung, Geschichtsschreibung, Rhetorik und bildende Kunst." (''"The Hellenistic culture but found its most thankful and its most understanding disciples in the Romans; they became patrons, imitators, and finally rivals, when they competitively set the own language beside the Greek: thus, the antique culture became bilingual, Greek and Latin. The system of this Greco-Latin culture, that assumed its definitive shape in the Roman imperial period, contained, amongst elements of the Orient, the Greek science and philosophy, poetry, historiography, rhetoric and visual arts."'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Veit Valentin]]: Weltgeschichte — Völker, Männer, Ideen (''History of the world — peoples, men, ideas''). {{Interlanguage link multi|Allert de Lange|de|3=Allert de Lange Verlag|vertical-align=sup}}, Amsterdam 1939, p.&amp;nbsp;113. "Es ist ein merkwürdiges Schauspiel&amp;nbsp;— dieser Kampf eines bewussten Römertums gegen die geriebene Gewandtheit des Hellenismus: der römische Geschmack wehrt sich und verbohrt sich trotzig in sich selbst, aber es fällt ihm nicht genug ein, er kann nicht über seine Grenzen weg; was die Griechen bieten, hat soviel Reiz und Bequemlichkeit. In der bildenden Kunst und in der Philosophie gab das Römertum zuerst den Kampf um seine Selbständigkeit auf&amp;nbsp;— Bilden um des Bildes willen, Forschen und Grübeln, theoretische Wahrheitssuche und Spekulation lagen ihm durchaus nicht." (''"It is a strange spectacle: this fight of a conscious Roman striving against the wily ingenuity of Hellenism. The Roman taste offers resistance, defiantly goes mad about itself, but there does not come enough into its mind, it is not able to overcome its limits; there is so much charm and so much comfort in what the Greeks afford. In visual arts and philosophy, Romanism first abandoned the struggle for its independence&amp;nbsp;— forming for the sake of the form, poring and investigation, theoretical speculation and hunt for truth were by no means in its line."'')&lt;/ref&gt;
This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, law, educational systems, [[philosophy]], science, warfare, poetry, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art and architecture of the modern world. From the surviving fragments of classical antiquity, a revival movement was gradually formed from the 14th century onwards which came to be known later in Europe as the [[Renaissance]], and again resurgent during various [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] revivals in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Archaic period (c. 8th to c. 6th centuries BC)==
{{Further|Iron Age Europe}}
The earliest period of classical antiquity takes place before the background of gradual re-appearance of [[historical]] sources following the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. The 8th and 7th centuries&amp;nbsp;BC are still largely [[proto-historical]], with the earliest [[history of the Greek alphabet|Greek alphabetic]] inscriptions appearing in the first half of the 8th century. [[Homer]] is usually assumed to have lived in the 8th or 7th century BC, and his lifetime is often taken as marking the beginning of classical antiquity. In the same period falls the [[traditional]] date for the establishment of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], in 776&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Phoenicians and Carthaginians===
{{Main|Phoenicia|Ancient Carthage}}
The [[Phoenicians]] originally expanded from [[Canaan]] [[port]]s, by the 8th century dominating trade in the [[Mediterranean]]. [[Carthage]] was founded in 814&amp;nbsp;BC, and the Carthaginians by 700&amp;nbsp;BC had firmly established strongholds in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] and [[Sardinia]], which created conflicts of interest with [[Etruria]].

===Greece===
{{Main|Archaic period in Greece}}
The Archaic period followed the [[Greek Dark Ages]], and saw significant advancements in [[political theory]], and the rise of [[democracy]], [[philosophy]], [[theatre]], [[poetry]], as well as the revitalisation of the written language (which had been lost during the Dark Ages).

In pottery, the Archaic period sees the development of the [[Orientalizing Period|Orientalizing style]], which signals a shift from the [[Geometric style]] of the later Dark Ages and the accumulation of influences derived from Egypt, [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria]].

Pottery styles associated with the later part of the Archaic age are the [[black-figure pottery]], which originated in [[Corinth]] during the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC and its successor, the [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure style]], developed by the [[Andokides Painter]] in about 530&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Iron Age Italy===
[[File:Etruscan civilization map.png|thumbnail|[[Etruscan civilization]] in north of [[Italy]], 800 BC.]]
The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] had established political control in the region by the late 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC, forming the aristocratic and monarchial elite. The Etruscans apparently lost power in the area by the late 6th century&amp;nbsp;BC, and at this point, the [[Italic peoples|Italic]] tribes reinvented their government by creating a [[republic]], with much greater restraints on the ability of rulers to exercise power.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Rome and the Roman Empire'' by Michael Kerrigan. Dorling Kindersley, London: 2001. {{ISBN|0-7894-8153-7}}. page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Kingdom===
{{Main|Roman kingdom}}
According to legend, Rome was [[founding of Rome|founded]] on April&amp;nbsp;21, 753&amp;nbsp;BC by twin descendants of the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, 1998. page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As the city was bereft of women, legend says that the Latins invited the [[Sabines]] to a festival and stole their unmarried maidens, leading to the integration of the Latins and the Sabines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/grecoromanmyth1/a/mythslegends_3.htm Myths and Legends – Rome, the Wolf, and Mars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529053414/http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/grecoromanmyth1/a/mythslegends_3.htm |date=2007-05-29 }}. Accessed 2007-3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence indeed shows first traces of settlement at the [[Roman Forum]] in the mid-8th century&amp;nbsp;BC, though settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] may date back to the 10th century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, 2003. page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duiker, 2001. page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh and final king of Rome was [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. As the son of [[Tarquinius Priscus]] and the son-in-law of [[Servius Tullius]], Superbus was of Etruscan birth. It was during his reign that the Etruscans reached their apex of power.

Superbus removed and destroyed all the Sabine shrines and altars from the [[Tarpeian Rock]], enraging the people of Rome. The people came to object to his rule when he failed to recognize the rape of [[Lucretia]], a patrician Roman, at the hands of his own son. Lucretia's kinsman, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] (ancestor to [[Marcus Brutus]]), summoned the Senate and had Superbus and the monarchy expelled from Rome in 510&amp;nbsp;BC. After Superbus' expulsion, the Senate voted to never again allow the rule of a king and reformed Rome into a [[Roman Republic|republican government]] in 509&amp;nbsp;BC. In fact the Latin word "Rex" meaning King became a dirty and hated word throughout the Republic and later on the Empire.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Classical Greece (5th to 4th centuries&amp;nbsp;BC)==
{{Main|Classical Greece}}
[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Delian League ("Athenian Empire"), right before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The classical period of Ancient Greece corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, in particular, from the fall of the [[tyrant#Athens|Athenian tyranny]] in 510&amp;nbsp;BC to the [[death of Alexander the Great]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC. In 510, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]]. [[Cleomenes&amp;nbsp;I]], king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy conducted by [[Isagoras]].

The [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499–449&amp;nbsp;BC), concluded by the [[Peace of Callias]] gave way not only to the liberation of Greece, [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Thrace]], and [[Ionia]] from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian rule]], but also resulted in giving the dominant position of [[Athens]] in the [[Delian League]], which led to conflict with [[Sparta]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]], resulting in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404&amp;nbsp;BC), which ended in a Spartan victory.

Greece entered the 4th century under [[Spartan hegemony]]. But by 395&amp;nbsp;BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the [[Corinthian War]], which ended inconclusively in 387&amp;nbsp;BC. Later, in 371&amp;nbsp;BC, the Theban generals [[Epaminondas]] and [[Pelopidas]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of [[Theban hegemony]]. Thebes sought to maintain its position until it was finally eclipsed by the rising power of [[Macedon]] in 346&amp;nbsp;BC.

Under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]], (359–336&amp;nbsp;BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the [[Paeonians]], the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]]. Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], (356–323&amp;nbsp;BC) managed to briefly extend [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]n power not only over the central Greek city-states, but also to the [[Persian Empire]], including [[Egypt]] and lands as far east as the fringes of [[India]]. The classical period conventionally ends at the death of Alexander in 323&amp;nbsp;BC and the fragmentation of his empire, which was at this time divided among the [[Diadochi]].

==Hellenistic period (323 BC to 146&amp;nbsp;BC)==
{{Main|Hellenistic period}}
{{Further|Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic religion}}
Classical Greece entered the Hellenistic period with the rise of [[Macedon]] and the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Koine Greek|Greek]] became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' far beyond Greece itself, and Hellenistic culture interacted with the cultures of [[Seleucid Empire|Persia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Central Asia]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]. Significant advances were made in the sciences ([[Ancient Greek geography|geography]], [[Greek astronomy|astronomy]], [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]] etc.), notably with the [[Peripatetic school|followers]] of [[Aristotle]] ([[Aristotelianism]]).

The Hellenistic period ended with the rise of the [[Roman Republic]] to a super-regional power in the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146&amp;nbsp;BC.

{{Main|Roman Republic}}
{{Further|culture of ancient Rome}}
The republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the [[Roman Kingdom|Monarchy]] c.&amp;nbsp;509&amp;nbsp;BC and lasted over 450 years until its [[subversion (politics)|subversion]], through a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]], into the [[Principate]] form of government and the Imperial period. During the half millennium of the Republic, Rome rose from a regional power of the [[Latium]] to the dominant force in Italy and beyond. The unification of Italy under Roman hegemony was a gradual process, brought about in a series of conflicts of the 4th and 3rd centuries, the [[Samnite Wars]], [[Latin War]], and [[Pyrrhic War]]. Roman victory in the [[Punic Wars]] and [[Macedonian Wars]] established Rome as a super-regional power by the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, followed up by the acquisition of [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]]. This tremendous increase of power was accompanied by economic instability and social unrest, leading to the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]], the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] and the [[First Triumvirate]], and finally the transformation to the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC.

{{Main|Roman Empire}}
[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan,&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;117]]

Determining the precise end of the Republic is a task of dispute by modern historians;&lt;ref&gt;The precise event which signaled the transition of the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation. Historians have proposed the appointment of [[Julius Caesar]] as perpetual dictator (44&amp;nbsp;BC), the [[Battle of Actium]] (September&amp;nbsp;2, 31&amp;nbsp;BC), and the [[Roman Senate]]'s grant of [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s extraordinary powers under the [[Augustus#First settlement|first settlement]] (January&amp;nbsp;16, 27&amp;nbsp;BC), as candidates for the defining pivotal [[Epoch (reference date)|event]].&lt;/ref&gt; Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist. The early [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] "[[Roman Emperor|Emperors]]" maintained that the ''[[res publica]]'' still existed, albeit under the protection of their extraordinary powers, and would eventually return to its full Republican form. The Roman state continued to call itself a ''res publica'' as long as it continued to use Latin as its official language.

Rome acquired imperial character ''de facto'' from the 130s&amp;nbsp;BC with the acquisition of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Illyria]], [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Hispania]], and definitely with the addition of [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC. At the time of the empire's maximal extension under [[Trajan]] (AD&amp;nbsp;117), Rome controlled the entire [[Mediterranean]] as well as Gaul, parts of [[Germania]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Dacia]], Asia Minor, the [[Caucasus]] and [[Mesopotamia]].

Culturally, the Roman Empire was significantly [[Hellenization|hellenized]], but also saw the rise of syncratic "eastern" traditions, such as [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and most notably [[Origins of Christianity|Christianity]].
The empire began to decline in the [[crisis of the third century]]

While sometimes compared with classical Greece, classical Rome had vast differences within their family life. Fathers had great power over their children, and husbands over their wives, and these acts were commonly compared with slave-owners and slaves. In fact the word family, "famiglia" in Italian, actually referred to those who were under authority of a male head of household. This included non-related members such as slaves and servants. Somewhat contradictory, marriage was viewed as something where both man and woman were loyal to one another and shared little things such as interests, and more intense as properties. Divorce was first allowed starting in the first century BC and could be done by either man or woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History Global Perspectives|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Late Antiquity|Migration period}}

Late Antiquity saw the rise of [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] under [[Constantine I]], finally ousting the [[Roman imperial cult]] with the [[Theodosian decrees]] of&amp;nbsp;393. Successive invasions of [[Germanic tribes]] finalized the
[[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]], in a state called the Roman Empire by its citizens, and labelled the [[Byzantine Empire]] by later historians.
Hellenistic philosophy was succeeded by continued developments in [[Platonism]] and [[Epicureanism]], with Neoplatonism in due course influencing the [[Christian theology|theology]] of the [[Church Fathers]].

Many writers have attempted to put a specific date on the symbolic "end" of antiquity with the most prominent dates being the deposing of the last [[Western Roman Emperor]] in 476,&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I.

From [[Internet Archive]]. The thesis was originally laid out in an article published in ''[[Revue Belge de Philologie et d'Histoire]]'' 1 (1922), pp. 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt; These Muslim conquests, of Syria (637), Egypt (639), Cyprus (654), North Africa (665), Hispania (718), Southern Gaul (720), Crete (820), and Sicily (827), Malta (870) (and the sieges of the Eastern Roman capital, First Arab [[Siege of Constantinople (674–78)]] and Second Arab [[Siege of Constantinople (717–18)]]) severed the economic, cultural, and political links that had traditionally united the classical cultures around the Mediterranean, ending antiquity (see [[Pirenne Thesis]]).&lt;ref name=Pirenne/&gt;

The original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use [[Latin]] as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army under [[Phocas]] resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the decline of Balkan and Greek urban culture (leading to the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see [[Origin of the Romanians]]), and also provoked the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor [[Heraclius]] in [[Constantinople]], who emerged during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western links weakened with the ending of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].

The Eastern Roman empire's capital city of [[Constantinople]] was left as the only unconquered large urban center of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Over the next millennium the Roman culture of that city would slowly change, leading modern historians to refer to it by a new name, [[Byzantine]], though many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was "rediscovered" by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the [[Ottomans]]. (See [[Rûm]] and [[Romaioi]].) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople was brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to spark the [[Renaissance]], see [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]].

Ultimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change in the socioeconomic structure in [[European history]] that led to the changeover between Classical Antiquity and Medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.

== Political Revivalism==
{{Further|Carolingian Renaissance|Ottonian Renaissance|Renaissance|Classicism|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}


In politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, headed by one supreme divinely-appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme [[patriarch]], proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west.  This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[Coronation|crowned]] "Roman Emperor" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.

That model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages; the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was the Empire's highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the Emperor, who was "God's Vicegerent on Earth". The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants [[Romioi|continued to call themselves "Romans"]] until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.

After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Russian [[Czar of Russia|Czar]]s (a title derived from ''Caesar)'' claimed the Byzantine mantle as the champion of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]; [[Moscow]] was described as the "[[Third Rome]]" and the Czars ruled as divinely-appointed Emperors into the 20th century.

Despite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The [[Papacy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in particular maintained Latin language, culture and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are called ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' which in the classical period was a title belonging to the Emperor, and the ideal of [[Christendom]] carried on the legacy of a united European civilisation even after its political unity had disappeared.

The political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire's collapse; it was revived by the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in&amp;nbsp;800; the self-described [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled over central Europe until 1806.

The [[Renaissance]] idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost under medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the [[Patriot (Spanish American Independence)|Latin American revolutionaries]]; the Americans described their new government as a ''republic'' (from ''[[res publica]]'') and gave it a ''Senate'' and a ''President'' (another Latin term), rather than make use of available English terms like ''commonwealth'' or ''parliament''.

Similarly in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were upheld by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. During the revolution France itself followed the transition from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that Rome had undergone centuries earlier.

== Cultural Legacy of Classical Antiquity ==
{{Main|Classicism|Classical studies}}
Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], literature, [[theater]], [[education]], architecture, and even [[History of sex|sexuality]].


''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]] .Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. "Classical antiquity" often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, &lt;blockquote&gt;"the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!" &lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].

[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature. In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival|Greek Revivals]], (though while apparently more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek). Still, one needs only to look at [[Washington, DC]] to see a city filled with large [[marble]] buildings with façades made out to look like [[Roman temple|Roman temples]], with columns constructed in the [[classical orders]] of architecture.

In philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic Polytheism]] to [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] [[theater]], [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]].

In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;DC]] is filled with large [[marble]] buildings with facades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders]] of architecture.

{{for|the language|Cubeo language}}
The '''Cubeo''' are an ethnic group of the [[Colombia]]n [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]]. Cubeo is a generic name that is used in local [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and appears in the literature in reference to a social and linguistic group. Although the term does not have any meaning in [[Cubeo language|their language]], the Cubeo refer to themselves by that name in interactions with others. There is no common native name, aside from referring to themselves as "people" (''pâmiwâ'') or, more precisely, "my people" (''jiwa''). An individual's social identification is based on his or her adscription to a mythical clan forebear whose name is used as an eponym.

==Location==
The Cubeo live in the area of the Colombian Vaupés, near the center of the Northwestern Cultural Area of the Amazon. Their villages are distributed along the median course of the Vaupés and, above all, alongside its affluents the [[Cuduyari]] and [[Querari]] rivers.

==Population==
Reports of the population vary between 3,000 and 5,000 individuals. The national census of 1985 established the number of inhabitants at 4,368.

==Language==
The [[Cubeo language|language of the Cubeo]] has been classified as belonging to Eastern Tukano. Recently, however, a reclassification has been suggested to Middle Tukano, a subdivision of a possible Proto-Tukano. This language is one of the rare [[Object–verb–subject|OVS]] languages in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/feature/81 Wals.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon''' is a dictionary database of images of various objects in a culturally authentic setting for language learning. All images are presented with a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike]] license, allowing for broad academic use by language teachers.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web| title = About CAPL| work = Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon| publisher = Washington &amp; Jefferson College| date = 18 June 2009 | url = http://capl.washjeff.edu/about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database is also useful for researchers in the field of applied linguistics, visual cognition, and automated image recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Park| first = Jane | title =  CAPL, the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon| work = creativecommons.org | publisher = [[Creative Commons]]| date = 18 June 2009| url = https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database averages 30,000 hits per month and has been incorporated into the curricula of many college and high-school level German teachers.&lt;ref name=usde /&gt;

The idea for the lexicon is partially based on Shaughnessy's experience with teaching materials that used American-based images and clip art to demonstrate German words and concepts.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; By presenting objects in their culturally authentic context, the CAPL is designed to prepare students to live in the environment where the language is spoken.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; The photographic entries are real photographs, not clip art, to force teachers to "teach terms for things that actually occur in everyday German life – instead of American concepts that have no direct European equivalent."&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news  | last = Read | first = Brock | title = Professor's Web Site Uses Photographs to Teach the German Language | work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | date = December 12, 2003 | url = http://chronicle.com/weekly/v50/i16/16a03103.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was founded in 2003 as a pilot project with over 1,000 unique entries for the German language. The first images were collected by Shaughnessy in Germany and Austria through a grant from W&amp;J College.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  In 2006, it received a $200,000 appropriation from the U.S. federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = SENATORS SANTORUM AND SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF WESTERN PA EDUCATION PROJECTS | publisher =Office of Senator [[Arlen Specter]]| date =July 24, 2006| url =http://specter.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=809&amp;Month=7&amp;Year=2006

Funding including the expansion of the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon (CAPL), an online German-language picture dictionary, that provides undergraduate foreign language teachers and students with a culturally authentic, easy-to-use Web-based learning tool. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the project was expanded to include more languages thanks to a $85,480 grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=usde&gt;{{cite news | title = Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon | work = Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education Grant Database  | publisher = [[United States Department of Education]] | date = 2008-06-01| url = http://fipse.aed.org/grantshow.cfm?grantNumber=P116Z080004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAPL was featured in an article in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; and has been recommended for use by the [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institute]], [[German Academic Exchange Service|German Academic Exchange Office]] and the National Capital Language Resource Center.&lt;ref name=usde /&gt; The book ''The Bilingual Mental Lexicon'' noted the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon's value in German language instruction for "naming and sorting activities, and in awareness-raising discussions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pavlenko| first = Aneta | title = The Bilingual Mental Lexicon| publisher = Multilingual Matters| date = 15 January 2009| location = | pages = 155| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jkcyXAoI9PcC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;ots=yiMHODCSra&amp;dq=%22culturally%20authentic%20pictorial%20lexicon%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA155| isbn = 978-1-84769-124-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A painted '''''desco da parto''''' (a '''birth tray''' or '''birth salver''') was an important symbolic gift on the occasion of a successful birth in late medieval and [[Early Modern]] [[Florence]] and [[Siena]].  The surviving painted ''deschi'' represented in museum collections were commissioned by elite families, but inventories show that birth trays and other special birth objects like embroidered pillows were kept long after the successful birth in families of all classes: when [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] died, the inventory shows that the ''desco da parto'' given by his father to his mother, [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]], at her [[lying-in]],&lt;ref&gt;The Medici–Tornabuoni ''desco da parte'', painted by Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, called "Scheggia", the brother of [[Masaccio]], with a ''Triumph of Fame'', is conserved at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], acc. no. 1995.1995.7.&lt;/ref&gt; was hanging in his private quarters to the day of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998 note 3 quotes from a 1475 inventory "''3 paia di schodelle'' [pairs of soup plates] ''di [[Maiolica|maiolicha]] da donna di parto''", at a time when the testator's children were fifteen and sixteen years old.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A ''desco da parto'' need not be specially commissioned; they were produced in workshops in series for stock, often being personalised with a coat-of-arms when they were bought.  There was a distinctive repertoire of [[iconography]] for the trays, the [[recto]] (top) sides sharing much with that for the painted [[cassone]] chests often used as gifts at marriage, but also with [[verso]] sides often showing scenes of mothers after [[childbirth]] or pin-up figures of boy toddlers, accompanied by the [[coats of arms]] of both parents.  After being used as a tray in the [[post partum]] period they could be hung on a wall as a painting.

==Usage==
[[Infant mortality]] was highest during the crucial first days, when the mother might also succumb to [[Puerperal fever|childbed fever]]. A successful childbirth was lavishly celebrated. Sons would one day assert the family interests, whether in modest workshop or banking house; daughters would share the household's work until they were married and would cement the  [[Exogamy|exogamous ties]] that stabilized Tuscan family position at every social level. Painted childbirth trays began to appear about 1370, in the generation following the [[Black Death]], when the tenuousness of life was more vivid than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998:140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifteenth century, D.C. Ahl found, at least one appears in almost half of all inventories she surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ahl, "Renaissance birth salvers and the Richmond ''Judgment of Solomon''", ''Studies in Iconography'' '''7''' (1981:157-84) p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mother was expected to remain "[[Lying-in|lying in]]" enjoying a period of [[bed rest]] during a [[postpartum period]] of variable duration, but probably lasting at least a week. No fixed term of lying-in is recommended in Renaissance manuals on family life (unlike in some other cultures), but it appears from documentary records that the mother was rarely present at the [[baptism]], in Italian cities usually held within a week of the birth at the local [[parish church]], normally a few minutes walk from any house.  During this period the mother and child were visited in the bedroom by family and female friends, and presented with presents.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; traditionally, a Chinese mother was not allowed to leave the house for a month, or receive visitors for 12 days.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tray, often covered with a protective cloth, was used for serving delicacies to the visitors, perhaps including some they had brought as presents: a maid brings a cloth-covered ''desco'' with two carafes of water and wine to fortify [[Saint Anne]] in [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco of the ''Birth of the Virgin'' (1436), in the Chapel of the Annunciation, Duomo of Prato,&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Musacchio 1998:141; the fresco is illustrated in Georges Duby, ed. ''A History of Private Life, II: Revelations of the Medieval World'' (1988) following p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Raiment might be ceremoniously brought into the specially-decorated [[bedchamber]] where the new mother lay: in [[Nativity (Masaccio)|a ''desco da parto'' by Masaccio]] of 1427,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]; illustrated in Duby 1988 p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; the tray and a covered cup are preceded by a pair of trumpeters flying banners with the Florentine ''[[Fleur de lis|gigli]]''. In fact in patrician households the bed was often placed in a reception room for the occasion (if there was not one already in such a room, after the fashion of the French and Burgundian courts), and the mother lay there while receiving visits from her friends over several days.

==Iconography==
For the painted trays made for the elite on these joyous occasions, in general, both sides of the tray are painted, the upper side (or [[recto]]) generally with a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from [[classical myth]] or a suitable [[allegory]].  Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases.  Birthing scenes were popular.  These might be the ''[[Nativity of Mary|Birth of the Virgin]]'' or that of Florence's patron saint, [[John the Baptist]], but only a halo or two distinguishes these from other scenes apparently showing a birth scene as a [[genre painting]]. A tray in the [[New York Historical Society]] shows a genre birthing scene but is closely copied from a drawing of the birth of John the Baptist by [[Lorenzo Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bartolom/fruosino/desco1.html Web Gallery of Art, "Desco da parto (recto)], 1428, Tempera on panel, diameter 59 cm, 
New York Historical Society, New York]; the verso is illustrated here&lt;/ref&gt;  

In all these the mother sits up in bed receiving gifts from a stream of female visitors, while at the front of the scene the child is washed or wrapped in [[swaddling]] by more women.  In one male pageboys serve the guests.  Another tray shows boys and men playing a local fighting game in the street (see gallery).  The earliest painted illustration of a ''[[novella]]'' of [[Boccaccio]] is on a Florentine ''desco da parto'' with the arms of a Pisan family, made c. 1410 and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bifa/ho_26.287.1,2.htm on-line catalogue entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The survivals include three allegorical scenes of the ''[[Triumph of Love (musical)|Triumph of Love]]'', derived from [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Triumphs]]'', and one ''Triumph of Venus''.

The underside or [[verso]] generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes [[heraldry]], with the arms of both parents shown.&lt;ref&gt;The Medici–Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the [[coats of arms]] of both parents at the sides, are especially popular.  The arms of the mother's family traditionally take the right hand side, but in some examples the arms have been changed by overpainting them.&lt;ref&gt;Christies&lt;/ref&gt;  Inscriptions in the field or round the rim sometimes provide the date of the fortunate event,&lt;ref&gt;A ''desco da parto'' dated 25 April 1428, in the [[New-York Historical Society]] collection (illustrated here), is attributed to the prolific manuscript illuminator and occasional panel painter, the Florentine [[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], in Paul F. Watson, "A Desco da parto by Bartolomeo di Fruosino" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''56'''.1 (March 1974:4–9); another ''desco'' by Bartolomeo is Musacchio 1998 fig. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; providing art historians with a useful fixed point.  Like some other types of art, such as the [[Old master prints#The earliest Italian engravings|"Otto prints"]], desci were mostly expected to be decorated in what was considered to be feminine taste, although how the design was selected is unclear.  In an example painted by [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi|Masaccio's brother]] two boys wrestle, with certainly one and probably both using the hold of pulling on the other's penis with one hand and hair with the other (see gallery).&lt;ref&gt;Conceivably the one on the right could be a girl, which would be an exception in these images&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – [[Martin Luther]] told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen.  This was also a factor in the display of images of the [[Virgin and Child]], which were ubiquitous in bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Artists and history==
Workshops that produced ''deschi da parto'' were often also [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], as for example [[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], an illuminator who also produced panel paintings, and painters of the panels that were incorporated into the fronts and ends of ''quattrocento'' ''[[Cassone|cassoni]]''. Such a workshop was that of the "Master of the Adimari cassone", now usually identified as Masaccio's brother [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi]] (or "Lo Scheggia", "the Splinter"), which also produced the ''desco da parto'' showing youths playing at ''civettino'' in an urban setting, in [[Palazzo Davanzati]], Florence,&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated in Duby 1988, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; and other examples.  A divided verso showing two naked boys fighting realized $482,500 at auction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists remain unidentified, and were clearly not of the first rank, but, given the significant names represented among the tiny proportion of survivors, it appears that many artists took an occasional break from larger projects to produce ''desci''.  The circular [[tondo (art)|tondo]] shape in normal [[panel painting]]s, which became fashionable in the mid-fifteenth century in Florence, may have developed from the smaller desci.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of the desco, usually about 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm across, is with twelve or sixteen sides, or from about 1430, round,&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 1998:141; Robert Olson, ''Florentine Tondo'', 2000:29, compares ''deschi'' with the circular format of a [[tondo (art)|tondo]].&lt;/ref&gt; enclosed within a slightly raised lip integral to the panel.  Some examples that are now round seem to have originally been twelve-sided.  Some have dates that record the day of the birth (or marriage) concerned. Only about two dozen desci survive, some now with the surfaces sawn apart by dealers in modern times, to create two works.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue entry for example in San Francisco: Nash, Steven A.; ''Masterworks of European painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor'', pp. 38–39, Hudson Hills, 1999, {{ISBN|1-55595-182-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55595-182-5}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Et3Te5KqgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=birthing+tray&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=hCTCSumMFoWyNpy5_NUD#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; In inventories they are often described as "broken" or "old", and most apparently were used as trays until too scruffy to keep.  As the 15th century continued they were gradually replaced as gifts by pieces of [[Maiolica|majolica]], often special "birthing sets" with similar iconography, although the [[Uffizi]] has an example of 1524 by [[Jacopo Pontormo]], and others are even later. Examples from the 16th-century tend to have a more raised bowl-like profile, as in the Pontormo, as if echoing the new maiolica shapes.  Production of painted cassoni ceased over the same decades. 

Jacqueline Marie Musacchio rejects the common assumption that these trays were made to celebrate a marriage; she never encountered a ''desco da nozze'' in any 15th-century inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Musacchio 98, note 24&lt;/ref&gt;  But a Sienese wedding casket (''cofanetto nuziale'') in wood in the Louvre has a round top with a ''Triumph of Venus'' by [[Giovanni di Paolo]] (dated 1421) that is effectively identical to the desci form.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Giovanni di paolo, cofanetto nuziale col trionfo di venere, siena 1421, 01.JPG|Image]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, if they were presented at the time of the marriage, though certainly regarded as associated specifically with pregnancy and childbirth, this would both explain how such elaborate objects were available for use very soon after an uncertain event, and mean that the beneficial images of boys could exert their positive influence throughout the important first pregnancy.

==Example in San Francisco==
The [[San Francisco Legion of Honor Museum]] has an example painted about 1400 by [[Lorenzo di Niccolo]], a Florentine painter who was active from 1391 to 1412.  The recto shows the story of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Actaeon]].  Diana, goddess of hunting appears in the foreground clothed in a dark, broaded robe and carrying a falcon; at the right, her nymphs pursue a boar. At the top of the painting, Diana and her nymphs are bathing in a pool of water when the mortal Actaeon happens upon the naked goddess. For offending the virgin deity, Actaeon was transformed into a [[stag]] to be hunted down by his own dogs. His fate is illustrated on the left side, where hounds chase a deer.  The reverse (verso) shows the allegorical figure of Justice with two family coats of arms while holding a scale and a sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Steven|title=Masterworks of European Painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor|date=1999|publisher=Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreyfus|first=Renee|title=Legion of Honor: Selected Works|date=2007|publisher=Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Crown dependency]] the Isle of Man parliament and government have competence over all domestic matters, including education; however the structure and curriculum are broadly in line with that of UK schools and particularly the [[National Curriculum for England|English national curriculum]]. Education is overseen by the [[Department of Education, Sport and Culture]] and regulated by the [[Isle of Man Education Act 2001]]. As of September 2017 there were 6,492 pupils in primary schools, and 5,218 pupils in secondary education.&lt;ref name="mediacentre" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Old Grammar School, Castletown - geograph.org.uk - 124105.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Grammar School, Castletown, used as a school from 1701 until 1930]]
Before 1675 there were no schools in the Isle of Man and any education was provided by the church. This changed with the arrival of [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Bishop Isaac Barrow]], who established a school in every parish.

==Education system==
The education system in the Isle of Man is similar to the system used in [[Education in England|England]]. [[Primary school]] consists of seven years, and [[secondary school]] of seven years. All five secondary schools in the Isle of Man have a [[sixth form]] centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28856">An '''ethnoburb''' is a [[suburban]] residential and business area with a notable cluster of a particular [[ethnic minority]] population. Although the group may not constitute the majority within the region, it is a significant amount of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Anatomy of a New Ethnic Settlement: The Chinese ''Ethnoburb'' in Los Angeles." ''Urban Studies,'' 35, 3 (1998): 482.&lt;/ref&gt; That can greatly influence the [[social geography]] within the area because of cultural and religious traditional values exhibited. Ethnoburbs allow for ethnic minority groups to maintain their individual identity, but that may also restrict their ability to fully assimilate into mainstream culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. ‘’Ethnoburn: The New Ethnic Community in North America.’’ University of Hawaii Press. Honolulu: 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Wei Li, the author of many writings on the subject, the ethnoburb has resulted from "the influence of international geopolitical and global economic restructuring, changing national immigration and trade policies, and local demographic, economic and political contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Anatomy of a New Ethnic Settlement: The Chinese ''Ethnoburb'' in Los Angeles." ''Urban Studies,'' 35, 3 (1998): 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many assume that an ethnoburb is composed of immigrants with a lower economic status, that may not always be the case, as many ethnoburbs are made up of wealthy and high economic status individuals in more expensive neighbourhoods and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Peach, Ceri. "Social Geography: New Religions and Ethnoburbs - Contrasts with Cultural Geography." ''Progress in Human Geography'' 26,2 (2006): 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, there is not always a "one size fits all" definition of what can be expected when examining an ethnoburb. By comparing different locations of ethnoburbs, various degrees of social characteristics, including economic standings and [[cultural assimilation]], can be observed.

==History of term==
The term was first coined in 1997 by Dr. Wei Li, then assistant professor of geography and [[Asian American studies]] at the [[University of Connecticut]], in a paper examining the suburban [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] population in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Li-Anatomy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/35/3/479|author=Wei Li|title=Anatomy of a New Ethnic Settlement: The Chinese Ethnoburb in Los Angeles|journal=Urban Studies|volume=35|issue=3|pages=479–501|year=1998|accessdate=2009-01-08|doi=10.1080/0042098984871}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She further examines and delineates the difference between "Chinatowns" and "ethnoburbs" in "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown: Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/index1018.html |title=Ethnoburb versus Chinatown: Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles |author=Li Wei |publisher=cybergeo.revues.org |date=1992-11-01 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnoburbs emerge in combination or as separate entities for reasons like significant changes in world politics and the world economy, policy changes in the US, and demographic shifts in individual or in local connecting neighborhoods. Such communities have substantial external connections to the globalised mainstream economy, leading to higher socioeconomic levels in its residents. An ethnoburb functions as a social hub and a place in which immigrants may work and do business within their own networks. That definition of an ethnoburb closely resembles that of the [[ethnic enclave]] as defined and studied by sociologists Wilson and Portes. Though the terms are different, the types and functions of these hubs are nearly identical. The formation of ethnoburbs also have an effect on the cultural and political characteristics of a city. In cities like [[San Francisco]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Toronto]]; in the [[New York City]]-[[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, DC]] areas; and in the [[San Gabriel Valley]], for example, Chinese immigrants have built large houses and malls catering to Chinese businesses, changing the landscape of the communities and a significant number of smaller ones throughout Canada and the US.&lt;ref name="DeWolf"&gt;Christopher DeWolf (2004) ''Keeping up with the Dosanjhs: The Rise of North American's Ethnoburbs''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnoburb: The New Ethnic Community in Urban America'' explores in depth the phenomenon of ethnoburbs scattered through the United States. The book used the term "ethnoburb" for the first time, in 1997, to describe the new formation of contemporary suburban Asian settlements, and the author continues her studies in larger metropolitan areas in the US and in Canada.&lt;ref name="Li-Anatomy"/&gt; 

The term has become widely used in academia and is slowly gaining usage in the popular vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whb.co.uk/socialissues/vol2vm.htm |title=Mobile Chinatowns: the future of community in a global space of flows |last=Miller |first=Vincent |publisher=whb.co.uk |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community dynamics==
Ethnoburbs present interesting benefits and disadvantages to those within the community. They can be shaped to meet the specific cultural and social needs of those who live there because of the high degree of ethnic similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Sandeep Kumar.  "Region of Peel: Immigration Discussion Paper." ''Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada,''  (2010): 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  That can be seen as a benefit as it aids in the adaptation of immigrants to a new environment in terms of language, culture, education, and job training. Also, the sharing of common cultural traditions and new experiences encountered allows a greater sense of community to be developed. An ethnoburb not only contributes to the fostering of cultural preservation particularly amongst immigrants but also can play an important role in the larger cultural tapestry of a greater regional area or country as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 6&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, ethnoburbs are sometimes viewed in a negative. It is thought that they can inhibit cultural assimilation because those living in these regions will become comfortable within the community and not expand to incorporate social elements from outside their community.  One way that can be mitigated is educational programs and the completion of public or private schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Sandeep Kumar. "Region of Peel: Immigration Discussion Paper." ''Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada,''  (2010): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the dominant culture within an ethnoburb is not always the majority of the population since other ethnicities are also present,&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 5&lt;/ref&gt; it can be helpful if the other cultures are also integrated into the regional identity to lessen the degree of severe representation and catering towards one ethnic group.

[[White flight]] can also be a result of ethnoburbs. Min Zhou, Yen-fen Tseng, and Rebecca Y. Kim claim:
{{quote|text=In the past, the movement of ethnic minorities of lower SES [socioeconomic status] into urban neighborhoods triggered white flight into the suburbs. The current movement of immigrants of higher SES into the suburbs has ushered in a similar trend because newcomers have settled without going through the time-honored process of acculturation. They pose a new threat to the established white middle-class residents, who fear being “un-Americanized” by the newcomers. The Chinese ethnoburb shows that affluent immigrants from Asia, no less than blacks and Hispanics, can be perceived as a threat to white middle-class communities when they achieve a substantial presence.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Min, Yen-fen Tseng, and Rebecca Y. Kim.  2009. "Suburbanization and New Trends in Community Development: The Case of Chinese Ethnoburbs in the San Gabriel Valley, California." Chapter 4 in Min Zhou, Contemporary Chinese America: Immigration, Ethnicity, and Community Transformation. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within Canada, the presence of ethnic communities is often favoured. That is a result of the country's belief in supporting a [[cultural mosaic]] in which individuals maintain their unique cultural identity after their immigration. Ethnoburbs are often viewed as an "expression of preferences, common interests, social networks and the cultural and/or religious residents... [serving] as the basis for their integration into the [[Canadian economy]] and society."&lt;ref&gt;Region of Peel: Immigration Discussion Paper." ''Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada,'' (2010): 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

That view may not be shared by all geographical regions and is still an issue of contention in some areas of Canada, as ethnoburbs can present both beneficial and negative elements that may either provide a pathway for the adaptation into a new society or the hindering of assimilation by cultural division.

In comparison, the United States has historically often discouraged the maintenance of cultural identity after immigration by [[melting pot]] policies and encouragement to adopt the [[American way of life|"American" way of life]]. However, there has still been an increasing trend in the United States for ethnic minority groups to maintain their cultural identity and individuality from the general American identity after immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, Sarah.  "The Great Melting Pot?"  ''BNP Media.'' 94,10 (2003):8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Vancouver, British Columbia ===
{{see|Residential segregation in Greater Vancouver}}
[[File:City of Vancouver, Spatial distribution of Chinese Residents.jpg|thumbnail|Geographic distribution of residents of Chinese ancestry in Greater Vancouver]]
The [[Greater Vancouver]] Regional District (GVRD) is home to a number of ethnic suburbs, each with its own unique characteristics. In recent years, changes to immigration policies have made the municipalities magnets for immigrants. Here, members of the community find acceptance, security and comfort in the presence of common cultural practices. However, in some situations, increasing segregation has led to tension.

In the past 40 years, the [[Canadian immigration]] policy has adopted a [[multicultural]] model, with immigrants being granted equal rights in all facets of society&lt;ref&gt;Edgington, David. "Social and cultural issues in the Pacific Rim: The case of international migration and a look at multicultural planning in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia." Paper. Six University Symposium First Session; What are the social and cultural issues in the Pacific Rim? Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto: Six University Symposium First Session 2003. p.5 Web. 28 Oct. 2012 http://gsis.korea.ac.kr/gri/contents/2005/8-01-David.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1962, the Canadian federal government used a country of origin preference system to grant immigration status. The removal of this policy and the introduction of a points system in 1967 caused an influx of immigration to the GVRD.&lt;ref&gt;Edgington, D., Goldberg, M., and Hutton, T. "The Hong Kong Chinese in Vancouver" in ''Asian Americans: From Enclave to “Ethnoburb,”'' Ed.Wei Li. Arizona:Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p.2. Web. Oct. 28, 2012 http://www.mbc.metropolis.net/assets/uploads/files/wp/2003/WP03-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, nearly 40,000 people immigrate to the GVRD every year, approximately 30,000 from Asia, with China and India as the two major source countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/publications/Publications/ImmigrantLandings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been the formation of ethnically-distinct municipalities such as Richmond and Surrey. From May 2013, the Canadian government tightened the language requirements for all immigrants, and reduced the benefits for immigrants who spoke both of Canada's two official languages. Here, there are increased opportunities for immigrants upon arrival in Canada.

====Richmond, British Columbia====
[[File:South Asian distribution in Greater Vancouver.jpg|thumbnail|Geographic distribution of residents of South Asian ancestry in Greater Vancouver]]
Large communities of visible minorities have changed the cultural landscape Vancouver's suburbs, adding to the diverse society that the GVRD prides itself on. Massive shopping malls built in the 1980s such as Aberdeen and [[Yaohan]] centres, are focused solely on Chinese clientele. Such shopping centres are highly specialized and highly successful. On average, 18.2% of the GVRD's population is [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese]]. In some parts of [[Richmond, British Columbia]], 66.9% of the population have Chinese heritage.&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com"&gt;Todd, Douglas "Mapping Our Ethnicity Part 1: South Asia in Surrey."''The Vancouver Sun'' 2 May 2012 Web. Oct 15 2012 https://vancouversun.com/ethnicity/Mapping+ethnicity+Part+South+Asia+Surrey/5547648/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For many new immigrants and long time residents alike, it is a great comfort to be able buy familiar foods and communicate with shop keepers in their native languages. However, some would argue the absence of English from signage and service creates tension within the Richmond community.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Robert. "Asian Investment Floods Richmond Vancouver Suburb a High-Tech Centre." The Globe and Mail: 0. Nov 16 1992. Canadian Newsstand Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2012 .&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration of newly arrived immigrants into the ethnoburbs of Metropolitan [[Vancouver]] has increased the diversity of the city but some might argue [[racial segregation|segregation]] based on [[ethnicity]] has risen in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Edgington, D., Goldberg, M., and Hutton, T. "The Hong Kong Chinese in Vancouver" in ''Asian Americans: From Enclave to “Ethnoburb,”'' Ed.Wei Li. Arizona:Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p 9. Web. Oct. 28, 2012. http://www.mbc.metropolis.net/assets/uploads/files/wp/2003/WP03-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This socially constructed segregation has physical ramifications on the landscape. In Vancouver's case, increased immigration of affluent Asians has also meant a boom in the housing market. The expansion of real estate development in the 1980s and 1990s lead to the transformation of post war suburbs into areas dominated by infamous "[[Vancouver Special]]s," monster homes, and megamalls. The extravagant building types have become points of contention in the GVRD. Along with that, a growing fear of longtime Canadians is that increasing immigration means decreased space in "good schools".&lt;ref&gt;Edgington, D., Goldberg, M., and Hutton, T. "The Hong Kong Chinese in Vancouver" in ''Asian Americans: From Enclave to “Ethnoburb,”'' Ed.Wei Li. Arizona:Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p 18-20. Web. Oct. 28, 2012. http://www.mbc.metropolis.net/assets/uploads/files/wp/2003/WP03-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors feed the argument that spatial segregation based on ethnicity effects the social fabric of communities.

However, tensions aside, Richmond's unique blend of culture has added to the [[mosaic]] of the city. Some Christians with Hong Kong roots take comfort in [[Cantonese]] sermons, being able to connect on personal, congregational, regional and international levels of community.&lt;ref&gt;Tse, Justin Kin-Hung"Transnational faith : a Hong Kong church in Richmond, British Columbia" Circle Electronic Theses and Dissertations: UBC 2009. Web. 28 Oct. 2012 https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/13011&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond is also home to many Buddhist temples and societies. The [[Ling Yen Mountain Temple]] is an active monastery, and boasts 10,000 members in Greater Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ling Yen Mountain Temple]]&lt;/ref&gt; This micro and macro scale involvement and sense of identity is beneficial in an increasingly global community.

====Surrey, British Columbia====
Another predominant ethnoburb filled with temples and shopping centres is in [[Surrey, British Columbia]]. Stretching from Newton to Bear Creek Park, from Strawberry Hill to Kennedy Heights, the neighbourhood is a picture of ethnic integration. According to Douglas Todd of ''The Vancouver Sun'', a fifth of Canada's South Asian community is found in Surrey, and many neighbourhoods are "intensely [[monoethnic]]." Moreover, census data reveals that two thirds residents of Surrey have South Asian heritage.  Census data puts the Greater Vancouver average of South Asian residents at 9.9%. In some parts of Surrey, South Asians account for 70.7% of residents,a higher concentration than Chinese residents in Richmond.&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com"/&gt; Based on Todd's case study of west Newton, people there do not feel segregated by ethnicity. Instead, there is a sense of familiarity, and community cohesiveness, despite Surrey's reputation for violence.&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com"/&gt; That unique sense of place and the resulting geographies of such communities is in part due the high occurrence of family migration practices.&lt;ref&gt;Walton-Roberts, Margaret."Transnational geographies: Indian immigration to Canada" ''Canadian Geographer''47. 3 2003. 235-250. Web. Nov. 2, 2012.http://search.proquest.com/docview/228352818&lt;/ref&gt; These practices are another result of evolving Canadian immigration policies.

Like Richmond, Surrey residents are proud of their contributions to social aspects of their communities. There are numerous Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu mandirs and Muslim mosques, alongside western houses of worship.&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com"/&gt; Festivals in both cities invite thousands of people every year to experience a sampling of different ethnic backgrounds. Surrey hosts a massive [[Vaisakhi]] Parade &amp; Celebration during April, the largest outside India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surreyvaisakhiparade.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond hosts many festivals itself, including the Summer Night Market. The festivities, attended by people of every ethnicity, highlight Asian culture and celebrate diversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmondnightmarket.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipalities are not the only [[ethnic enclaves]] in the GVRD. Several neighbourhoods in [[Vancouver]] proper have formed, based on lines of heritage. Chinatown, Little Italy, South Fraser and more are examples of such communities. They are on a smaller scale than Richmond or Surrey.  Mapping of ethnicity in Greater Vancouver shows that populations, although concentrated in some areas, disperse out on a gradient. Research on the subject depicts the landscapes as places of integration and acceptance. Increasing diversity has increased the liveability of this growing metropolis. There are, of course, challenges to multiculturalism. Nonetheless, they are communities with deep roots, unique traditions, and shared social identities.

===Los Angeles, California===
One of the largest cities in the United States, [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] is a culturally-diverse urban area with pockets of ethnic communities within the city, including many Chinatowns.  As populations in the urban regions continued to grow and became increasingly congested, many ethnic groups began migrating out of the [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|urban centre of Los Angeles]] and into newer and more affordable suburban communities surrounding the city,&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei.  ''Ethnoburb: The New Ethnic Community in Urban America'' (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2009), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing their quality of life from that of a downtown, inner-city neighbourhood, to a more open and clean suburban community. In particular, many ethnic communities in Los Angeles moved to the nearby [[Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel Valley, especially Monterey Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Anatomy of a New Ethnic Settlement: The Chinese ''Ethnoburb'' in Los Angeles." ''Urban Studies,'' 35, 3 (1998): 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to escaping regional congestion, this area offered further geographical opportunities as it "is bordered by three major freeways... making it easier to get downtown, where most jobs were located, and to Chinatown."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. ''Ethnoburb: The New Ethnic Community in Urban America'' (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2009), 83-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles is also an interesting example when examining the distinct difference between an ethnoburb and a [[Chinatown]]. In the article "Ethnoburb Versus Chinatown: Two Types of Urban Communities in Los Angeles," Dr. Wei Li looks at these differences by comparing the Chinatown communities within downtown Los Angeles and the ethnoburbs in the surrounding San Gabriel Valley area. By examining historical records, census data, and conducting interviews, she reveals how the Chinese community within the region, in particular, has greatly evolved from densely populated Chinatowns in the downtown to more geographically spread out regions in an ethnic suburb.  For example, according to Li, "the San Gabriel Valley ethnoburb had become by 1990 a more important Chinese residential area than Chinatown."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 18&lt;/ref&gt; Li also explains how the ethnoburb offers more opportunities than a Chinatown, as there are additional economic benefits through business opportunities when catering towards the regional cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 19&lt;/ref&gt;

She reveals further differences between an ethnoburb and Chinatown in that the composition of the populations vary in terms of age, socioeconomic level, and time since their immigration. Within a Chinatown, the population is mainly "immigrants of Chinese descendants from mainland China and Southeast Asia, with a much older age structure and longer duration of residence... [and] socio-economic status of its residents is lower."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 21&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, although culturally an ethnoburb may appear to cater towards a specific ethnic group, the regional areas tend to include a more ethnically diverse population, which is composed of a greater variety of age groups with a higher socioeconomic status. In addition, a higher level of education is more common within an ethnoburb when compared to a Chinatown, thus allowing for a greater degree of use and understanding of English within the areas.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wei. "Ethnoburb versus Chinatown : Two Types of Urban Ethnic Communities in Los Angeles," ''Cybergeo,'' (1998): 25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Li's findings show that an ethnoburb can be culturally positive in the sense that it allows for more opportunities than.a Chinatown.

===Auckland, New Zealand===
[[Auckland]], which has a predominantly European population, as well as one of the highest [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] populations in the world, experienced a dramatic increase in Asian migration during the 1900s. Over the past 20 years, many Asian immigrants migrating to Auckland have settled into "ethnoburbs". About 60% of the Chinese population in New Zealand lives in Auckland and by 1990, they were the fourth-largest ethnic group, and people started settling in East and South Auckland. The areas were of existing high quality housing or brand new neighborhoods. By 2006, all of Auckland was considered its own Chinese ethnoburb because of Auckland’s already small population, based on Li Wei’s concept of ethnoburbs. The spatial distributions in Auckland proposed there would be three large ethnoburb regions: North Shore City (North Auckland), Auckland City (Central East Auckland) and Manukau City (East Auckland).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Xue,Friesen,O'Sullivan: Diversity in Chinese Auckland: Hypothesising Multiple Ethnoburbs&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Chinese people come to New Zealand not only for economic reasons but also for better education, the relaxed lifestyle and the stable political system.

===Toronto, Ontario===
Many Chinese residents live outside the downtown Chinatown area and in suburbs of the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. Spatial patterns of ethnic residential and business districts have been shaped mainly by development in the suburbs. Only 18% of the 338,265 Chinese residents in [[Toronto]] live in the downtown area, as the rest live in suburbs. Areas with a lower population Chinese residents (closer to the downtown area) are in East York, Etobiocke, North York, Scarborough, and York, which account for 47% of the Chinese population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Li, Wei: Ethnoburb : The New Ethnic Community in Urban America&lt;/ref&gt; Areas that are on the outer suburb zone (Markham, Richmond Hill, and Mississauga) make up the remaining percentage of Chinese population. In recent years, the Chinese economy in the Greater Toronto Area has changed from local restaurants and grocery stores to consumer services in large shopping centres. That has brought more shopping centres to the inner and outer suburbs, enlarging Toronto's economy.

Much like in Los Angeles, the Chinese population in Toronto also stratifies along lines of origin and socioeconomic class that show up in residential patterns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Immigrants from Hong Kong were the largest population from China to Toronto and moved to Markham and Richmond Hill, which influenced the style of the new upscale shopping centres. Immigrants from Taiwan settled in North York because of the public school system.

In addition to the Chinese community, Toronto's massive South Asian community has also developed in the suburbs of Brampton (38% South Asian) and Mississauga (22% South Asian). 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Wei|title=Ethnoburb : The New Ethnic Community in Urban America|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/docDetail.action?docID=10388468|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably, South Asians are the fastest growing minority group in the distant Toronto suburbs of Milton and Ajax, and numerous Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim places of worship have been built in those areas.

===Melbourne, Australia===
Australia is also undergoing a shift in its demography with large numbers of Asian immigrants settling in the country. From 2010 to 2011, Australia recorded 14,611 settlers from China&lt;ref&gt;Settler Arrival Data, Department of Immigration and Citizenship, accessed Nov 4 2012 [http://www.immi.gov.au/media/statistics/statistical-info/oad/settlers/setdatb.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the 2011 census, there were 393,924 people in Australia born in Mainland China and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2011~Community%20Profile~0/$File/BCP_0.zip?OpenElement 2011 Census - Community Profile Data]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney]] had nearly half of all Chinese-born citizens (46.6%) and [[Melbourne]] had slightly over a quarter (28.5%) according to the census data.&lt;ref&gt;2011 Census: [http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2011~Community%20Profile~1GSYD/$File/BCP_1GSYD.zip?OpenElement Sydney Community Profile], [http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2011~Community%20Profile~2GMEL/$File/BCP_2GMEL.zip?OpenElement Melbourne Community Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne has received some of the focus of the changing demographics because of Asian immigration. [[Glen Waverley]] is a community in Melbourne with a large proportion of Chinese-Australian citizens. According to an article in ''[[The Age]]'', Glen Waverley has many Chinese immigrants because the area provides high-quality education, good transportation and safety, making it the hub of Chinese Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Shane. ''Most Liveable? Chinese Think So'', The Age, August 5, 2012. [http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/most-liveable-chinese-think-so-20120804-23mno.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article, public high schools in the area have been inundated with Chinese Australians, representing up to 80% of the student population. According to another article in ''The Age'', European luxury vehicles, such as [[Audi]] and [[BMW]], are the most popular car brands in Glen Waverley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theage.drive.com.au/motor-news/thats-no-toorak-tractor-20110414-1dekn.html Park, Barry.

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
'''Harshness''' (also called '''raucousness'''), in [[music information retrieval]], is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional [[psychoacoustic]] feature called as musical [[timbre]].

Classical timbre’ NLDs are [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[spectral centroid]], and [[spectral flux]]. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]], single-[[Musical note|note]], musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6224">[[Sigmund Freud]] noticed that [[humor]], like dreams, can be related to unconscious content.&lt;ref name = Freud2&gt;Freud, S. (1928). Humor. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]], 9,'' 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1905 book ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten}}), as well as in the 1928 journal article ''Humor'', Freud distinguished contentious jokes&lt;ref name = Matte7&gt;Matte, G. (2001). A psychoanalytical perspective of humor. ''Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 14''(3),223-241&lt;/ref&gt; from non-contentious or silly humor.  In fact, he sorted humor into three categories that could be translated as: [[joke]], [[comic]], and [[mimetic]].&lt;ref name =Freud3&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''Jokes and their relation to the unconscious'' (J. Strachey, Trans.). New York: W. W. Norton. (Original work published 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's theory of humor==
In Freud's view, jokes (the verbal and interpersonal form of humor) happened when the [[conscious]] allowed the expression of thoughts that society usually suppressed or forbade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 215–228 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[superego]] allowed the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to generate [[humor]].&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;  A benevolent [[superego]] allowed a light and comforting type of humor, while a harsh superego created a biting and sarcastic type of humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  A very harsh superego suppressed humor altogether.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  [[Freud]]’s humor theory, like most of his ideas, was based on a dynamic among [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;  The commanding superego would impede the ego from seeking pleasure for the id, or to momentarily adapt itself to the demands of reality,&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt; a mature coping method.  Moreover, Freud (1960)&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; followed [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ideas of energy being conserved, bottled up, and then released like so much steam venting to avoid an explosion.  Freud was imagining psychic or emotional energy, and this idea is now thought of as the relief theory of laughter.

Later, Freud re-turned his attention to humor noting that not everyone is capable of formulating humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name = Newirth8&gt;Newirth, J. (2006). Jokes and their relation to the unconscious: humor as a fundamental emotional experience. ''Psychoanalytic dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 557–571&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different types of humor==
If [[jokes]] let out forbidden thoughts and feelings that the conscious mind usually suppresses in deference to society,&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, A. (2006). ''Humor.'' In The internet encyclopedia of philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/humor.htm#H3, retrieved from the web on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an interaction between unconscious drives and conscious thoughts.

[[Mimesis]], on the other hand, was a process involving two different representations of the body in our mind.&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; For example, in the phrase “Their hearts are in the right place,” the heart has two representations.  One is, of course, anatomical while the other is a metaphorical reference to caring and meaning well.

===Tendentious jokes===
Tendentious jokes are jokes that have to contain lust, hostility or both.

===Non-tendentious jokes===

The [[comic]] meant applying “to one and the same act of ideation, two different ideational methods” (Freud, 1905, 300; as cited in Matte, G. (2001)&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;). [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Falstaff]] would be an example of Freud's "comic," generating laughter by expressing previously repressed inhibition.&lt;ref name = Kincaid4&gt;Kincaid, J. R. (2001). ''Falstaff as an example for Freud’s “comic.”'' http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/kincaid2, retrieved from the web on the 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An upset American says at Sunday School: "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] is my Shepherd; I am in want. He makes me to lie down on park benches; he leads me in the paths of destruction for His party's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. (2006) ''Studies in American humor'', University of Southern California, http://www.compedit.com/introduction.htm, retrieved from the web 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In advertising ==
An analysis of content from [[business-to-business]] advertising magazines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany found a high (23 percent) overall usage of humor. The highest percentage was found in the British sample at 26 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Lynette S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Ronald K.|date=1993|title=Humor in American, British, and German Ads|url=|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=22|pages=17-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the types of humor found by McCullough and Taylor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; three categories correspond with Freud’s grouping of tendentious (aggression and sexual) and non-tendentious (nonsense) wit. 20 percent of the humor are accounted for as “aggression” and “sexual.” “Nonsense” is listed at 18 percent.

==Criticism==
It has been claimed that Freud's division is artificial and not very clear.&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1&gt;Altman, N. (2006). And now for something completely different: Humor in psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Altman (2006),&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; these divisions are more semantic than functional.  Hence, all three types of humor may be the result of the dynamic of the [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; For example, hate and anger can be hidden by a false sense of love and compassion, which could be the opposite of what was meant, and which could formulate a joke.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt;

[[File:Nursing area sign.png|thumb|Sign for a private nursing area at a museum using the [[international breastfeeding symbol]]]]
The '''International [[breastfeeding]] symbol''' was created by Matt Daigle, a [[graphic artist]] and father.  He created the symbol in response to a contest hosted by [[Mothering (magazine)|''Mothering'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061113214815/http://www.mothering.com/sections/action_alerts/iconcontest/icon-winner.html Mothering's Breastfeeding Symbol Contest Has a Winner.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The winner was chosen in November 2006 out of a total of more than 500 entries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506030338/http://www.mothering.com/newsletter/pressrelease-nov06.html Mothering Magazine announces winner of International Breastfeeding Icon Design Contest.] November 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Daigle, who says his wife and son were the inspiration behind the symbol, signed the symbol over to the [[public domain]].

Increasing cultural diversity and personal mobility have created a growing need for universal modes of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hablamosjuntos.org/signage/symbols/default.symbols.asp :Hablamos Juntos :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Breastfeeding Symbol was created in the style of the [[AIGA]] [[ideogram|symbol signs]] commonly seen in public places. These signs need to be designed carefully because they need to be understood at a glance by most people without written descriptions explaining what they mean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs Symbol Signs: Society &amp; Environment: AIGA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Breastfeeding Symbol was created specifically to address the perceived problem of not having a universally accepted and understood symbol for breastfeeding available in public places.  The modern iconography representing infancy usually involves artificial feeding or soothing objects, like a nurser bottle icon or pacifier symbol. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVOctNov99p107b.html LLLI | Breastfeeding Myths Perpetuated by Culture, Society and the Health Care System.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing rooms traditionally use a [[baby bottle]] symbol to designate what they are instead of a symbol of a mother nursing a child.  The International Breastfeeding Symbol may be helpful in shifting the bottle-feeding cultural paradigm toward the biological norm of breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/metaphor/metacom_bodies.php?kap=7 Governance through metaphor project - commentaries | Union of International Associations (UIA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625222758/http://www.uia.org/metaphor/metacom_bodies.php?kap=7 |date=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, the International Breastfeeding Symbol site, dedicated to the new symbol, was launched. Examples of uses of the symbol include:
*In 2008, the South Sound Breastfeeding Network of the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]], featured the symbol in a "Breastfeeding Welcome Here" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sound Breastfeeding Network's Breastfeeding Welcome Here Campaign|url=http://www.southsoundbreastfeeding.org/bfwelcome.html|accessdate=September 24, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100208221939/http://www.southsoundbreastfeeding.org/bfwelcome.html|archivedate=February 8, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2009, the symbol was to be posted at a [[Chick-fil-A]] restaurant in [[Winter Park, Florida]], United States, following a complaint by a restaurant customer that the manager of the restaurant had unlawfully asked her to cover her baby's head while breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shay|last=Harris|title=Breastfeeding battle at Chick-fil-A |url= http://www.myfoxorlando.com/dpp/news/orange_news/081309_breastfeeding |work= FOX 35 News |date=August 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JFH: Justice For Hire''' (also known as '''''JFH''''', '''''Justice For Hire''''', and '''''JFH: Justice-For-Hire''''') is a [[mixed martial arts]] themed entertainment property that encompasses a series of comic books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Comics on comiXology|url=http://www.comixology.com/JFH-Justice-For-Hire/comics-series/3286|publisher=ComiXology|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH original short film excerpt|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpnDRLFmnM|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Brawl webisode|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHD-fi6IPk|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killa Icons - Ivory featuring Ebony (song)|url=https://soundcloud.com/janlucanus/killa-icons-attention-ivory|website=Soundcloud|publisher=Creative Impulse Music|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Motion Comic Pilot Episode|url=http://vimeo.com/67982313|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''JFH'' story follows two sons of a duo of vigilante fathers that get their family's hero-for-hire business legalized, spawning a worldwide industry of heroes, villains, and mercenaries for hire dubbed the Retribution Industry.  Produced and published by [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]], ''JFH'' remains one of the first examples of [[transmedia storytelling]] in the comic book industry.&lt;ref name="The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1|url=http://comicbookdb.com/podcast.php?ID=54|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''JFH'' was created by real-life father/son martial arts champions and comic book writers [[Jan C. Childress]] and [[Jan Lucanus]].  Lucanus appears as a regular cast member in the live action content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH: Justice For Hire - The Web Series Episode #0|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8vGSZ9DaVI|website=YouTube|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comic Book History ==

As explained in an interview with [[Kodak]]'s "In Camera" magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus on Film: Justice-for-Hire|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com/live/=Kodak - In Camera Magazine|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; what started as a series of student films Jan Lucanus was directing from his high school and college days at the [[New York Film Academy]] and [[New York University]] grew into expanded short films and an award winning "Justice-For-Hire" 47-minute Featurette&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Father/Son Duo Honored at '05 Budo International Hall of Fame|url=http://www.mauricepromartialarts.com/budo%20gala%20review.html|publisher=Budo International|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that doubled as both Jan's company [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]]'s&lt;ref name="Creative Impulse Entertainment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Creative Impulse Ent. Website|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com|publisher=Creative Impulse Entertainment|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; second narrative production and his NYU senior thesis film. The same footage from the featurette was recut into shorter episodic content, placed on four DVDs, and bundled with issues 1-4 of the "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" comic book series, marking the first time in the history of the comic book industry in which a physical comic book and DVD combination package was sold for an entire series run.&lt;ref name="Midtown Comics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucanus|first=Jan|title=JFH: Justice-For-Hire #4|year=2008|publisher=Creative Impulse Publishing|pages=32|url=http://www.midtowncomics.com/store/dp.asp?prid=1000314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launch ===

In 2007, ''JFH'' co-creator Jan Lucanus took an independent approach to spreading the word about his new comic series, doing a pre-release print run that debuted at the [[New York Comic Con]], and calling upon his contacts in the martial arts community and across media to get the comics to people outside of the traditional comic book audience (the print comic book industry was notorious for marketing only to comic book readers, rather than targeting audiences outside of the [[niche market]]&lt;ref name="Niche Comic Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niche Comic Market|url=http://www.comicbookmanifesto.com|publisher=The Comic Book Manifesto|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  "JFH" comics were given away in martial arts contests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFH Contest - Inside Kung Fu Magazine|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com/html/downloads.php|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=Inside Kung Fu Magazine|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at events for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[VH1]], and [[Adidas]].  Later that year, marketing guru [[Ken Goldstein]] and entrepreneur Tonny Sorenson, along with partner Bob Johnson,&lt;ref name="Bob Johnson bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Johnson bio|url=http://www.xmedialab.com/mentor/bob-l-johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; made Jan the first Artist-in-Residence (''AiR'') within their lifestyle brand, [[Von Dutch]] (the ''AiR'' program later transformed into the Planet Illogica agency&lt;ref name="Planet Illogica designs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Illogica designs|url=http://murphydesign1.blogspot.com/2009/04/planet-illogica-launch-and-introduction.html|publisher=Mark Murphy|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Before the official market release, "JFH" comics were distributed within the [[SoHo]], New York and [[Los Angeles]], California Von Dutch store fronts.  On September 27, 2007, Jan co-hosted the Von Dutch-sponsored launch event for the "JFH" comic book - "Justice-For-Hire Presents Fight Night at the Von Dutch" in Los Angeles, CA.  Gift bags filled with "JFH" comics and other sponsored items were given to a crowd of 1,100 spectators as they were presented with martial arts demonstrations and exhibition fights from Jan and his "JFH" fight team members, including champion fighters Hinton Wells,&lt;ref name="Hinton Wells vs. Jan Lucanus - San Da demo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hinton Wells vs. Jan Lucanus - San Da demo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lodpBeijUvg|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Morgan,&lt;ref name="Ian Morgan vs Gabe Dorado Muay Thai- JFH/Von Dutch event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Morgan vs Gabe Dorado Muay Thai- JFH/Von Dutch event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkt1wdrgUk8|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximillion Chen,&lt;ref name="Maximillion Chen vs. Mercer Boffey - JFH/Von Dutch event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximillion Chen vs. Mercer Boffey - JFH/Von Dutch event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6aFIzCL4fc|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabe Dorado, [[Ahmed Best]], Jesse Abrescy,&lt;ref name="Jesse Abrescy IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Abrescy IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1444917/|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] Master John Machado,&lt;ref name="John Machado BJJ demo JFH/Von Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Machado BJJ demo JFH/Von Dutch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6y0_WkibCQ|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Jan's father Jan C.

Other performances included an [[Oprah Winfrey]]-sponsored choir,&lt;ref name="JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night - A Bloggers Recap"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night - A Bloggers Recap|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/JFH-Fight-Night-at-Von-Dutch-A-Blogger-Recap-by-Darion-Lowenstein.pdf|publisher=Darion Lowenstein|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acrobatics from [[Cirque du Soleil]] troop, REALIS.&lt;ref name="REALIS profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=REALIS profile|url=http://www.gigsalad.com/realis_is_arthur_davis_and_shenea_booth|publisher=[[GigSalad]]|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sponsors included Hollywood's [[Golden Apple Comics]] shop, [[Inside Kung Fu]] Magazine, [[Black Belt (magazine)]], Alacer Corp.

Celebrities in attendance included [[Seth Green]], [[Lea Thompson]], as well as a slew of martial arts masters from across California.&lt;ref name="JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night Poster"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night Poster|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/JFH-Justice-For-Hire-FIGHT-NIGHT-at-Von-Dutch-Poster.jpg|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print Distribution &amp; Reviews ===

A year of independent promotions and the non-traditional packaging of comics &amp; DVD's landed Jan's small, newly formed publishing subsidiary, Creative Impulse Publishing, a vendor deal with [[Diamond Comics]] Distributors, the worldwide monopoly for printed comics distribution.  Creative Impulse Publishing officially released of the first issue of the printed "JFH" comic book/DVD bundles to comic shops internationally on December 26, 2007.,&lt;ref name="JFH #1 release"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucanus|first=Jan|title=JFH: Justice-For-Hire #1|year=2007|publisher=Creative Impulse Publishing|pages=32|url=http://www.legacycomics.net/item/OCT073385/JFH-Justice-For-Hire-1-of-12-Cvr-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a bi-monthly release schedule into June 2008 to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1"/&gt; The "JFH" comic book received 4 out of 4 stars from Newsarama.com, which reviewed the book as "cinematic genius on the printed page...some of the most realistic kung-fu sequences ever drawn for a comic book". The live action DVD content received positive reviews from several media outlets including TheComicBookPage.com podcast, which is quoted, "the [live action] content was excellent. The basic premise for the series...absolutely brilliant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Creative Impulse Spotlight on TheComicBookPage.com|url=http://www.comicspodcasts.com/2010/09/29/publisher-spotlight-004-creative-impulse-entertainment/|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=The Comic Book Page Podcast|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept of "JFH"'s Retribution Industry has also been criticized by several media outlets including Comics Forge, "Overall because of the moral ambiguity in the story lines, I am going to rate this 4 of 5, technically excellent, but morally questionable",&lt;ref name="Comics Forge JFH critique"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morril|first=Dan|title=Justice for Hire|url=http://www.comicsforge.com/2012/01/justice-for-hire/|publisher=Comics Forge|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Geeksmash.com, "When all you need is money to get rid of a problem, the team could easily degrade into hit-men to the highest bidder.  I don’t know if the creators are as concerned with these thematic messages as much as they simply want to put out a cool, tough fighting book".&lt;ref name='Geeksmash Review of "JFH" #0'&gt;{{cite news|last=Burrows|first=Jon|title=Review: Justice For Hire #0|url=http://geeksmash.com/comic-books/review-justice-for-hire-0-81312|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Geeksmash|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Comics ===

After the initial "JFH" print release, [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]] was approached by [[comiXology]] to produce a "JFH" iPhone app that carried both the comic and the live action video. ComiXology was concurrently developing a new digital comics service and was seeking indie publishers to release their comics digitally and prove the viability of the digital comics business to larger publishers. ComiXology launched the Comics App &lt;ref name="Comics App link"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comics App|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comics/id303491945?mt=8|publisher=comiXology|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2009 with "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" as one of the launch titles. The "JFH" digital comic books spent nine consecutive weeks on the Top 25 Action/Adventure Downloads List&lt;ref name="JFH #1 on ComiXology August 24, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH #1 on ComiXology August 24, 2009|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/JFHonTop25iPhoneComicsApp09.jpg|publisher=comiXology|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twelve consecutive weeks as the number one ranked Martial Arts Genre Download on comiXology's Top 25 List. "JFH", along with all of Creative Impulse Publishing's first wave of titles, remained on the Top 25 Martial Arts Downloads List until comiXology updated the platform's user interface in 2012, removing the Top 25 listings by genre completely.&lt;ref name="Last Top 25 List for Martial Arts Genre - ComiXology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Top 25 List for Martial Arts Genre - ComiXology|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/LastTop25MAgenreListComiXology.jpg|publisher=comiXology|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ComiXology remains the leading digital comic service in the industry.&lt;ref name="comiXology website"&gt;{{cite web|title=comiXology website|url=http://www.comixology.com|publisher=comiXology|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With digital distribution on all mobile and desktop devices via partnerships with comiXology, [[Graphic.ly]], iVerse Media,&lt;ref name="iVerse Media website"&gt;{{cite web|title=iVerse Media website|url=http://iversemedia.com|publisher=iVerse Media|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other digital distributors, "JFH" is one of the most downloaded martial arts comic book series on any digital comics platform.&lt;ref name="CNet JFH Download"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNet JFH Download|url=http://download.cnet.com/Justice-For-Hire/3000-20412_4-75496422.html|publisher=cnet|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motion comic animations ==

Creative Impulse Entertainment partnered with Willow Road Animation&lt;ref name="Willow Road Animation website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Willow Road Animation website|url=http://willowroad.squarespace.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to adapt the ''JFH'' comic book series into a motion comic animation. The pilot episode, directed by Jan Lucanus, was launched in February 2012 during the "JFH FreeFor All" Event&lt;ref name="JFH Free For All Event Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Free For All Event Announcement|url=http://blog.graphicly.com/contest-jfh-free-for-all-event-animate-win/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with digital comic network Graphicly,&lt;ref name="Graphicly website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphicly website|url=http://graphicly.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; media outlet [[iFanboy]], and animation software developer [[Reallusion]]. The event called upon artists from across the globe to submit drawings and animations of their favorite ''JFH'' characters as well free comics and animation software as incentives to participate. Winners were announced in April 2012.&lt;ref name="Graphicly's JFH Free For All Event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphicly's JFH Free For All Event|url=http://blog.graphicly.com/winners-of-the-justice-for-hire-free-for-all-event-revealed/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''JFH'' Motion Comic Animation had its premiere public screening at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic Con International]]'s Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza&lt;ref name="San Diego Comic Con 2012: 15th Annual Kung Fu Extravaganza"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Comic Con 2012: 15th Annual Kung Fu Extravaganza|url=http://work.byhandmedia.com/2012/08/19/sdcc-comiccon-san-diego-comic-con-2012-images-ric-meyers-15th-annual-kung-fu-extravaganza/}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[Ric Meyers]],&lt;ref name="Ric Meyers website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ric Meyers website|url=http://ricmeyers.com/2012/07/17/san-diego-comic-con-superhero-extravaganza-playlist-2012/}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Jan and Willow Road President Zach Shelton announced a live action feature film and animated series production partnership for ''JFH: Justice-For-Hire'' with Spillwall Productions.&lt;ref name="Spillwall Productions website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spillwall Productions website |url=http://spillwallproductions.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022075415/http://www.spillwallproductions.com/ |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spillwall Vice President Sam Levine was present to address the event's audience.

In 2013, the ''JFH'' motion comic pilot episode began its official film festival and industry competition run, winning the 34th Annual Silver Telly Awards highest honor for Best Use of Animation Online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Wins 2013 Silver Telly Awards|url=http://www.tellyawards.com/winners/list/?event=14&amp;category=3&amp;award=S|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2013 Silver Davey Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Animated Pilot wins 2013 Davey Award|url=http://www.willowrd.com|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Award of Merit at the 2014 Accolade Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Accolade Competition Winners|url=http://www.accoladecompetition.org|publisher=Accolade Competition|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announced at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic Con International]] Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza, the live-action adaptation of ''JFH: Justice-For-Hire'' is slated for production via a partnership between [[Jan Lucanus]]'s company Creative Impulse Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Creative Impulse Entertainment"/&gt; (CIE) and the Canadian-based Spillwall Productions.&lt;ref name="Spillwall Productions website" /&gt; Jan will co-direct and co-star as one of the main characters, "Ebony",.&lt;ref name="Graphicly JFH Free For All Winner Will Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montegomery|first=Paul|title=Graphicly JFH Free For All Winner Will Roberts|url=http://blog.graphicly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ebony-Will-Roberts.jpg|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Graphicly|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature follows an original story conceived by Jan and developed via a partnership between CIE and Nine Dot Entertainment that will act as a prequel to the first season of ''JFH'' comics.&lt;ref name='ComiXology - "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" Comics'&gt;{{cite web|title=ComiXology - "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" Comics|url=http://www.comixology.com/JFH-Justice-For-Hire/comics-series/3286|publisher=ComiXology|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay is co-written by Jan, award-winning screenwriter and director Aurore Barry,&lt;ref name="Aurore Barry IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurore Barry IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1927804/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan's father, comic book writer Jan C.

In 2013, the ''JFH'' creative team launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to shoot a short film to establish the cinematic tone for the ''JFH'' feature, as well as test out a martial arts camera system designed for the film, called "Weapon Camera Movement".  The short, entitled ''JFH: Justice For Hire - Retribution Task Force'', brought together several characters across the ''JFH'' Universe for a common goal - stopping acts of violence against women committed by the [[Raskol gangs]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Kickstarter|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1958778211/jfh-justice-for-hire|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film premiered at the 2014 Comic Con Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyers|first1=Ric|title=San Diego Comic Con Kung Fu Extravaganza 2014 Playlist!|url=http://ricmeyers.com/2014/08/01/san-diego-comic-con-kung-fu-extravaganza-2014-playlist/|website=RicMeyers.com|publisher=Ric Meyers|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a featured screening at the HBO/Cinemax Urban Action Showcase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH at HBO Cinemax Urban Action Showcase|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/vAVZNXHXEl/?taken-by=justiceforhire|website=Instagram|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bent-Con&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH at Bent-Con|url=https://bentcon2014.sched.org/event/1vui/jfh-justice-for-hire-retribution-task-force|website=Bent-Con|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year.

'''''Jazz''''' is a [[1992 in literature|1992]] [[historical novel]] by [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer]] and [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning [[United States|American]] author [[Toni Morrison]]. The majority of the narrative takes place in [[Harlem]] during the 1920s; however, as the pasts of the various characters are explored, the narrative extends back to the mid-19th-century [[Southern United States|American South]].

The novel forms the second part of Morrison's [[The Divine Comedy|Dantesque trilogy]] on African-American history, beginning with ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' (1987) and ending with ''[[Paradise (novel)|Paradise]]'' (1997).

==Narrative style and themes==
The novel deliberately mirrors the [[Jazz|music of its title]], with various characters "improvising" solo compositions that fit together to create a whole work. The tone of the novel also shifts with these compositions, from bluesy laments to up beat, sensual ragtime. The novel also utilizes the [[call-and-response]] style of jazz music, allowing the characters to explore the same events from different perspectives.

This book also features "[[Unreliable narrator|untrustworthy narrators]]" whose emotions and perspective colour the story. Narration switches every so often to the viewpoint of various characters, inanimate objects, and even concepts. The book's final narrator is widely believed to be Morrison or perhaps the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1455/is_2_11/ai_n29001508/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Joe Trace''', a door-to-door cosmetics salesman and the murderer of his young lover.
* '''Violet Trace''', an unlicensed beautician. Violet is married to Joe. She is nicknamed "Violent" because she assaulted the corpse of Joe’s lover with a knife at the funeral.
* '''Dorcas''', Joe's young lover, who is shot down at a party. Dorcas is inspired by a picture from ''[[The Harlem Book of the Dead]]'' (a collection of funeral photographs by [[James Van Der Zee]]).
* '''Alice Manfred''', Dorcas' aunt and guardian. A conservative Christian ashamed by her niece's behavior. Alice enters into an unusual friendship with Violet.
* '''Felice''', a friend of Dorcas' who goes to the Trace household in search of answers.
* '''Golden Gray''',  a [[multiracial|mixed race]] man from the 19th century. Golden appears in both Joe's and Violet's histories.

{{About|an Angolan demon||Kishi (disambiguation){{!}}Kishi}}
The '''kishi''' is a two-faced [[demon]] in [[Angola]]. According to legend, a kishi has an attractive [[human]] man's face on the front of its body and a [[hyena]]'s face on the back. Kishi are said to use their human face, as well as smooth talk and other charms to attract young women, who they then eat with the hyena face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mack |first=Carol K. |author2=Dinah Mack  |year=1999 |title=A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels, and Other Subversive Spirits |publisher=Macmillan http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/12/carol-mack-demons-fairies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyena face is said to have long sharp teeth and jaws so strong they cannot be pulled off anything it bites.

The word ''kishi'', ''nkishi'', or ''mukisi'' means "spirit" in several [[Bantu languages]] spoken in [[Zaire]], northern [[Zambia]], and [[Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knappert |first=Jan |year=1977 |title=Bantu Myths and Other Tales |publisher=Brill Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lowbrow''', or '''lowbrow art''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/arthistory101/a/lowbrow.htm|title=The Lowbrow Movement - Art History 101 Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an underground [[visual art]] movement that arose in the [[Los Angeles, California]], area in the late 1970s. It is a populist art movement with its cultural roots in [[underground comix]], [[punk music]], [[tiki culture]], and [[hot-rod]] cultures of the street. It is also often known by the name '''pop surrealism'''. Lowbrow art often has a sense of humor &amp;ndash; sometimes the humor is gleeful, sometimes impish, and sometimes it is a sarcastic comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/arthistory101/a/lowbrow.htm|title=The Lowbrow Movement - Art History 101 Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lowbrow artworks are [[painting]]s, but there are also [[Designer toys|toy]]s, [[digital art]], and [[sculpture]].

==History==
Some of the first artists to create what came to be known as lowbrow art were underground cartoonists like [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] and [[Gary Panter]]. Early shows were in alternative [[art gallery|galleries]] in New York and Los Angeles such as Psychedelic Solutions Gallery in Greenwich Village, New York City which was run by Jacaeber Kastor, [[La Luz de Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laluzdejesus.com/|title=La Luz De Jesus - The birthplace of pop surrealismLa Luz De Jesus - The birthplace of pop surrealism|website=La Luz De Jesus}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by Billy Shire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billyshirefinearts.com/|title=Billy Shire Fine Arts|website=www.billyshirefinearts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[01 gallery]] in Hollywood, run by John Pochna. The movement steadily grew from its beginning, with hundreds of artists adopting this style. As the number of artists grew, so did the number of galleries showing Lowbrow; The arbiter Greg Escalante helped produce the first formal art gallery exhibition to take low brow art seriously at the [http://www.juliericogallery.com Julie Rico Gallery] in Santa Monica with the one-man show "Looney Virtues", in 1992 by artist [http://ausgangart.com Anthony Ausgang.] The Bess Cutler Gallery also went on to show important artists and helped expand the kind of art that was classified as Lowbrow. The lowbrow magazine ''[[Juxtapoz]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com|title=Juxtapoz Magazine - Home|website=www.juxtapoz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Robert Williams, first published in 1994, has been a mainstay of writing on lowbrow art and has helped direct and grow the movement.

Writers have noted that there are now distinctions to be drawn between how lowbrow manifests itself in different regions and places. Some see a distinct U.S. "west coast" lowbrow style, which is more heavily influenced by tiki, underground comix and hot rod car-culture than elsewhere. As the lowbrow style has spread around the world, it has been intermingled with the tendencies in the visual arts of those places in which it has established itself. As lowbrow develops, there may be a branching (as there was with previous art movements) into different strands and even whole new art movements. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Origin of the term "lowbrow art"==
In an article in the February 2006 issue of his magazine ''Juxtapoz'', Robert Williams took credit for originating the term "lowbrow art."  He stated that in 1979 [[Gilbert Shelton]] of the publisher [[Rip Off Press]] decided to produce a book featuring Willams' paintings. Williams said he decided to give the book the self-deprecating title ''The Lowbrow Art of Robt. Williams'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beinart.org/info/essays/robert-williams.php|title=beinArt Gallery - A curated space for highly skilled figurative artists with a shared fascination for strange &amp; imaginative themes|website=beinArt Gallery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085309/http://beinart.org/info/essays/robert-williams.php|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since no authorized art institution would recognize his type of art. "Lowbrow" was thus used by Williams in opposition to "[[highbrow]]." He said the name then stuck, even though he feels it is inappropriate. Williams refers to the movement as "cartoon-tainted abstract surrealism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beinart.org/info/essays/robert-williams.php|title=beinArt Gallery - A curated space for highly skilled figurative artists with a shared fascination for strange &amp; imaginative themes|website=beinArt Gallery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085309/http://beinart.org/info/essays/robert-williams.php|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
." Lately, Williams has begun referring to his own work as "Conceptual Realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxJ44T2tX0&amp;feature=related|title=Robert Williams on Art News 02|first=|last=sketchv|date=14 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The '''Lu Xun Literary Institute''' (鲁迅文学院), located in [[Beijing]], is China's only national academy in literature education. Established in 1950 as the '''Central Literary Research Institute''' (中央文学研究所), it was closed in 1957 due to the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] and not reopened until 1980. The current name, after the prominent literary figure [[Lu Xun]], was adapted in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporary_chinese_culture.academic.ru/481/Lu_Xun_Literary_Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miss Teen USA''' is a [[beauty pageant]] run by the [[Miss Universe Organization]] for girls aged 14–19. Unlike its sister pageants [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss USA]], which are broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], this pageant is [[webcast]] on the Miss Teen USA website and simulcast on mobile devices and video game consoles.

The pageant was first held in 1983 and has been broadcast live on [[CBS]] until 2002 and then on [[NBC]] from 2003–2007. In March 2007, it was announced that the broadcast of the Miss Teen USA pageant on NBC had not been renewed, and that [[Miss Teen USA 2007]] would be the final televised event.&lt;ref name=eonline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/54769/trump-and-miss-universe-stay-in-bed-with-nbc|title=Trump and Miss Universe Stay in Bed with NBC|first=Sarah|last=Hall|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008–15, the pageant was held at the [[Atlantis Paradise Island]] Resort, located in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].

Notable pageant winners include actresses [[Kelly Hu]] (1985, [[Hawaii]]), [[Bridgette Wilson]] (1990, [[Oregon]]), [[Charlotte Ayanna|Charlotte Lopez-Ayanna]] (1993, [[Vermont]]), [[Vanessa Lachey|Vanessa Minnillo]] (1998, [[South Carolina]]), [[Shelley Hennig]] (2004, [[Louisiana]]), and sportscaster [[Allie LaForce]] (2005, [[Ohio]]).

The current titleholder is [[Hailey Colborn]] of [[Kansas]] who was crowned on May 18, 2018 at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].

==Competition rounds==

Prior to the final telecast the delegates compete in the preliminary competition, which involves private interviews with the judges and a presentation show where they compete in swimsuit and evening gown.

During the final competition, the semi-finalists are announced and go on to compete in swimsuit and evening gown. From 1983 to 2002 all semi-finalists also competed in an interview competition as well as both swimsuit and evening gown, followed by one or two final interview questions. In [[Miss Teen USA 2003|2003]], a new format was introduced where the top fifteen competed in evening gown, the top ten competed in swimsuit and the top five competed in the final question. In [[Miss Teen USA 2006|2006]], the order of competition was changed where the top fifteen competed in swimsuit and the top ten in evening gown. The latest competition format was used since [[Miss Teen USA 2008|2008]] the final not broadcast on TV, where the top fifteen both competed in swimsuit and evening gown, and the top five competed in the final question who all signed up by a panel of judges.

Former Miss Teen USA Katherine Haik wanted to eliminate the swimsuit competition.&lt;ref name="eliminate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/miss-teen-usa-pageant-to-eliminate-swimsuit-competition-w211632 |title=Miss Teen USA wants to eliminate swimsuit competition |last=French |first=Megan |date=June 29, 2016 |access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swimsuit category was chastised for exploiting and sexualizing young women and not promoting diverse body types. The new active-wear portion will increase the focus on wellness and health of young ladies.&lt;ref name="eliminate"/&gt;

==Broadcasting of the pageant==

===1983–2007: Viewership and later decline===
The pageant's viewership peak was hit in 1988, when the pageant averaged over 22 million viewers on [[CBS]]. Even as recently as 1999, the show managed to bring in over 10 million viewers. The 2006 airing was the second lowest rated in the pageant's 23-year history, with only 5.6 million viewers watching the live broadcast (the lowest: 2004, with 5.34 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6698.asp|title=Crowning tears: Miss Teen USA skids|publisher=''Media Life Magazine''|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 telecast (25th Anniversary, scheduled for August 24, 2007) was the last time Miss Teen USA aired live on television.

===2008–present: Internet pageant===
The 2008 pageant was held, untelevised, on August 16, 2008. One factor that prevented NBC from broadcasting was its prime time commitment to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].
Since then, it is broadcast over the [[Internet]] on the Miss Teen USA website. It can be viewed worldwide, without any region restrictions via [[geolocation]]. Currently, it is hosted by [[YouTube]] ([[Ustream]] from 2008-13). In addition, the webcast can be accessed on the pageant's [[Facebook]] page and on mobile devices using the official Miss Universe mobile app released during [[Miss USA 2016]].

In 2012, the pageant began to simulcast in selected regions on Microsoft's Xbox Live service, allowing owners of the [[Xbox 360]] (until 2017) and/or [[Xbox One]] [[video game console|console]]s to watch the pageant on a television screen. In 2017, the pageant was also broadcast on [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Network]] service.

The 2017 pageant was the first to include both a 360-video option for [[virtual reality]] headsets and [[high-dynamic-range video#HDR10|HDR10]] support for Xbox One S owners. The 2018 pageant featured support for [[Dolby Atmos]] audio and [[4K resolution|4K]] video on the Xbox One S and X consoles.

===Miss Teen USA at Miss USA===
In the early years of Miss Teen USA, three winners represented the title "Miss Teen USA" at [[Miss USA]]. The three queens were: Ruth Zakarian (1983), Cherise Haugen (1984), and Allison Brown (1986). This also made history because the Miss USA 1984 pageant had 53 delegates, the most ever in a Miss USA pageant. In 1987, Miss Teen USA 1986, Allison Brown participated in the 1987 Miss USA pageant. All three failed to make the cut at their respective Miss USA pageants.

Only in the three years mentioned above did Miss Teen USA winners automatically gain representation at [[Miss USA]]. Starting in 1988, if the Miss Teen USA winners want to compete at Miss USA, they first must win a Miss USA state crown. A total of seven Miss Teen USA winners have participated at Miss USA, with four winning their state Miss USA crowns first. The first of these was Kelly Hu, Miss Teen USA 1985, who won the [[Miss Hawaii USA]] 1993 title and represented Hawaii at Miss USA 1993. She finished as a finalist. The next was [[Jamie Solinger]], Miss Teen USA 1992. She took the Miss Iowa USA 1998 title but failed to make the cut at the Miss USA pageant. Only two Miss Teen USA winners have made the top 3 of Miss USA. [[Brandi Sherwood]], Miss Teen USA 1989 won the [[Miss Idaho USA]] 1997 title. Succeeding Kelly, she took 1st runner up and later inherited the Miss USA crown, when [[Brook Mahealani Lee]] of Hawaii won [[Miss Universe]] 1997. She is the only Miss Teen USA winner to hold the title Miss USA. [[Shauna Gambill]] was close in winning the Miss USA 1998 title, but placed 1st runner up to [[Shawnae Jebbia]], [[Miss Massachusetts USA]] 1998. However, to date it has never happened that the same woman had won the 2 separate pageants officially.

There have been two years when two Miss Teen USA winners participated at Miss USA. The first was 1984, when Miss Teen USA 1983 and Miss Teen USA 1984 participated, the second was 1998, when Jamie Solinger competed as [[Miss Iowa USA]] but went unplaced, and [[Shauna Gambill]] competed as [[Miss California USA]] and placed first runner-up.

The first Miss Teen USA not to win a Miss USA state pageant on her first attempt was [[Christie Lee Woods]], Miss Teen USA 1996, of Texas, who placed third runner-up in the [[Miss Texas USA]] 2002 pageant. She would also become the first Miss Teen USA to compete for, but never win a Miss USA state title (she also placed as a semi-finalist in 2003 and 2004). The second Miss Teen USA who did not win a Miss USA state title on her first attempt was [[Ashley Coleman]], Miss Teen USA 1999, of Delaware, who competed in the [[Miss California USA]] 2006 pageant and finished third runner-up. She is the first Miss Teen USA winner to compete in a different state from that where she won her Miss Teen USA crown. [[Tami Farrell]], Miss Teen USA 2003, competed at [[Miss California USA]] 2009 as Miss Malibu USA, but failed to win the crown, placing first runner-up to [[Carrie Prejean]]. Farrell competed at Miss Teen USA as [[Miss Oregon Teen USA]], and was one of the few Miss Teen USA winners to try for the state crown outside of the state she represented for Miss Teen USA. In a span of only two years later, [[Miss Teen USA 2006]], [[Katie Blair]] also competed at [[Miss California USA]] 2011. Representing the state of Montana at Miss Teen USA 2006, Blair is only the third Miss Teen USA to compete in a state other than the state she competed in Teen. Similarly to Coleman and Farrell, Blair placed 1st runner up in the pageant, to [[Alyssa Campanella]], who also competed in Miss Teen USA representing New Jersey. Campanella went on to win [[Miss USA 2011]].

[[File:Attributes of Music.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], ''Attributes of Music'', 1770. This [[still life]] painting depicts a variety of French Baroque musical instruments, such as a [[natural horn]], [[transverse flute]], [[Musette de cour|musette]], [[pardessus de viole]], and [[lute]].]]
A '''musical instrument''' is an instrument created or adapted to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument.{{fact|date=October 2018}} The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a [[trumpet]] to signal success on the hunt, or a [[drum]] in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of [[melody|melodies]] for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.

The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple [[flute]], dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.

Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the [[Middle Ages]], instruments from [[Mesopotamia]] were in [[maritime Southeast Asia]], and Europeans played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]].

Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called [[organology]].

==Definition and basic operation==
A musical instrument makes sounds. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies—for example, by clapping—to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.&lt;ref name="Montagu1"&gt;{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.&lt;ref name="Rault9"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments. A player sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of "making music".&lt;ref name="Rault9" /&gt;

Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from "found objects" such a shells and plant parts.&lt;ref name="Rault9" /&gt; As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Rault9" /&gt; One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way—for example, by plucking the strings on a [[string instrument]].&lt;ref name="Rault9" /&gt;

==Archaeology==
Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Blades34"&gt;{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flûte paléolithique (musée national de Slovénie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|Found in [[Slovenia]], the [[Divje Babe Flute]] is considered the world's [[paleolithic flutes|oldest known musical instrument]]]]
In July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of [[Slovenia]]. The carving, named the [[Divje Babe Flute]], features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a [[diatonic scale]]. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the [[Neanderthal]] culture.&lt;ref name="SAS"&gt;{{harvnb|Slovenian Academy of Sciences|1997|pp=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument.&lt;ref name="Chase and Nowell"&gt;{{harvnb|Chase|Nowell|1998|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; German archaeologists have found [[mammoth]] bone and [[swan]] bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the [[Swabian Alps]]. The flutes were made in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{harvnb|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence of musical instruments was discovered in excavations at the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur|Royal Cemetery]] in the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]]. These instruments, one of the first ensembles of instruments yet discovered, include nine [[lyre]]s ( the [[Lyres of Ur]]), two [[harp]]s, a silver double [[flute]], [[sistra]] and [[cymbal]]s. A set of reed-sounded silver pipes discovered in Ur was the likely predecessor of modern [[bagpipes]].&lt;ref name="collinson"&gt;{{harvnb|Collinson|1975|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cylindrical pipes feature three side-holes that allowed players to produce whole tone scales.&lt;ref name="Campbell82"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations, carried out by [[Leonard Woolley]] in the 1920s, uncovered non-degradable fragments of instruments and the voids left by the degraded segments that, together, have been used to reconstruct them.&lt;ref name="de Schauensee"&gt;{{harvnb|de Schauensee|2002|pp=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graves these instruments were buried in have been [[carbon dated]] to between 2600 and 2500 BC, providing evidence that these instruments were used in Sumeria by this time.&lt;ref name="Moorey"&gt;{{harvnb|Moorey|1977|pp=24–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists in the [[Jiahu]] site of central [[Henan province]] of China have found flutes made of bones that date back 7,000 to 9,000 years,&lt;ref name=bnl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/1999/bnlpr092299.html|title=Brookhaven Lab Expert Helps Date Flute Thought to be Oldest Playable Musical Instrument|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing some of the "earliest complete, playable, tightly-dated, multinote musical instruments" ever found.&lt;ref name=bnl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jiah/hd_jiah.htm|title=Jiahu (ca. 7000–5700 B.C.)|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scholars agree that there are no completely reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early [[slit drum]]s involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.&lt;ref name="Sachs60"&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German musicologist [[Curt Sachs]], one of the most prominent [[Musicology|musicologists]]&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnomusicology|musical ethnologists]]&lt;ref name="Baines37"&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1993|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. He maintains, for example, that contemporary [[anthropology|anthropologists]] comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft [[Anthropological theories of value|cannot determine which instruments are more "primitive"]].&lt;ref name="Sachs61"&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge.

Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.&lt;ref name="Sachs63"&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.&lt;ref name="Sachs63" /&gt;

The science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better historical picture.&lt;ref name="Blades34" /&gt;

===Primitive and prehistoric===
[[File:Two Teponaztli.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aztec]] slit drums (''[[teponaztli]]''). The characteristic "'''H'''" slits can be seen on the top of the drum in the foreground.]]
[[File:Guitar (molo).jpg|thumb|Guitar (molo)]]
Until the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]], descendant of [[Cain]] and "father of all such as handle the harp and the organ", [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], inventor of the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who is said to have made a dried [[tortoise]] shell into the first [[lyre]]. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive "invention" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term "musical instrument" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a ''[[Homo habilis]]'' slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.&lt;ref name="Sachs297"&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], stampers, and various [[drum]]s.&lt;ref name="Blades36"&gt;{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.&lt;ref name="Sachs26"&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Rault34"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs34&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=34–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the [[Chukchi people]] of the [[Russian Far East]], the indigenous people of [[Melanesia]], and many cultures of [[Africa]]. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.&lt;ref name="Blades51"&gt;{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; One East African tribe, the [[Wahinda]], believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.&lt;ref name=Sachs35&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments for producing a [[melody]]. Until this time in the evolutions of musical instruments, melody was common only in singing. Similar to the process of [[reduplication]] in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes—one tube would produce a "clear" sound and the other would answer with a "darker" sound. Such instrument pairs also included [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated genders with them; the "father" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the "mother" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest [[xylophone]].&lt;ref name=Sachs52&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of [[Southeast Asia]], eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.&lt;ref name="Marcuse24"&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|pp=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three "leg bars" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the [[harp|ground harp]], [[zither|ground zither]], [[musical bow]], and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].&lt;ref name=Sachs53&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
Images of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylon]]ian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to [[division of labor]] and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.&lt;ref name=Sachs67&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in [[Mesopotamia]]. Scholars must rely on artifacts and [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.&lt;ref name=Sachs68&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have been able to distinguish six [[idiophones]] used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, [[Sistrum|sistra]], bells, cymbals, and rattles.&lt;ref name=Sachs69&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of [[King Amenhotep III|Amenhotep III]],&lt;ref name=Remnant168&gt;{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and among the Native American [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] tribe.&lt;ref name=Sachs70&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the [[violin]].&lt;ref name=Sachs82&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian lute players 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egyptian]] tomb painting depicting lute players, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ({{circa|1350}} BC)]]
Musical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess.&lt;ref name=Sachs86&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years.&lt;ref name=Sachs86 /&gt; Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.&lt;ref name="Rault71"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the [[Kassites]] destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the [[Hyksos]] destroy the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.&lt;ref name=Sachs86 /&gt; Under their new cultural influences, the people of the [[New Kingdom]] began using [[oboe]]s, trumpets, [[lyre]]s, [[lute]]s, [[castanet]]s, and [[cymbal]]s.&lt;ref name=Sachs98&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=98–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in [[Israel]] between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref name=Sachs105&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]]: the ''ugab'' (pipes) and ''[[kinnor]]'' (lyre).&lt;ref name=Sachs106&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instruments of the period included the ''tof'' ([[frame drum]]), ''pa'amon'' (small bells or jingles), [[shofar]], and the trumpet-like ''hasosra''.&lt;ref name=Sachs108&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=108–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of a monarchy in Israel during the 11th&amp;nbsp;century BC produced the first professional musicians and with them a drastic increase in the number and variety of musical instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs114&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identifying and classifying the instruments remains a challenge due to the lack of artistic interpretations. For example, stringed instruments of uncertain design called nevals and asors existed, but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them.&lt;ref name=Sachs116&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''A Survey of Musical Instruments'', American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse proposes that the nevel must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to ''nabla'', the Phoenician term for "harp".&lt;ref name="Marcuse385"&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], [[Rome]], and [[Etruria]], the use and development of musical instruments stood in stark contrast to those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Sachs128&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods.&lt;ref name=Sachs129&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as ''[[aulos]]'' (reeds) or ''[[syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]]'' (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique.&lt;ref name=Campbell82/&gt; Romans played reed instruments named ''[[tibia (instrument)|tibia]]'', featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes.&lt;ref name=Campbell83&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the [[Orient]], lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.&lt;ref name=Sachs149&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of musical instruments in use by early civilizations of [[India]] is almost completely lacking, making it impossible to reliably attribute instruments to the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs151&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the [[Indus script]] has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the [[Rigveda]], or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes.&lt;ref name=Sachs152&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the [[Snake charming|snake charmer's]] [[double clarinet]], [[bagpipes]], barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=Sachs161&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mokugyo.jpg|thumb|A Chinese [[wooden fish]], used in Buddhist recitations]]
Musical instruments such as [[zither]]s appeared in Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier.&lt;ref name=Sachs185&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophers]] such as [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), [[Mencius]] (372–289 BC), and [[Laozi]] shaped the development of musical instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music similar to that of the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.&lt;ref name=Sachs162&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idiophones]] were extremely important in Chinese music, hence the majority of early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the [[Shang dynasty]] mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter of which has been excavated and preserved by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=Sachs166&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zhou dynasty]] saw percussion instruments such as [[clapper (musical instrument)|clappers]], troughs, [[wooden fish]], and ''[[Yu (percussion instrument)|yǔ]]'' (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, [[pan-pipe]]s, [[pitch-pipe]]s, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period.&lt;ref name=Sachs178&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Xiao (flute)|xiao]]'' (an [[end-blown flute]]) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Sachs189&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although civilizations in [[Central America]] attained a relatively high level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations in the development of musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody.&lt;ref name=Sachs192&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[pre-Columbian]] [[South America]]n civilizations in areas such as modern-day [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Chile]] were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.&lt;ref name=Sachs196&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=196–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Painting ney.jpg|thumb|A young Persian lady playing a ''[[ney]]'', painted on [[Hasht Behesht]] walls in [[Esfahan]], [[Safavid dynasty]]. ]]
During the period of time loosely referred to as the [[Middle Ages]], China developed a tradition of integrating musical influence from other regions.  The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in [[Turkestan]]. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.&lt;ref name=Sachs207&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.&lt;ref name=Sachs218&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first [[Bow (music)|bowed]] zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.&lt;ref name=Sachs216&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and [[tremolos]] of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music.&lt;ref name=Sachs221&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.&lt;ref name=Sachs222&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-Islamic times, idiophones such as [[hand bell]]s, cymbals, and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music. The gong-like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet. Tubular drums, stick zithers ([[veena]]), short fiddles, double and triple flutes, coiled trumpets, and curved India horns emerged in this time period.&lt;ref name=Sachs223&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=222–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic influences brought new types of drums, perfectly circular or octagonal as opposed to the irregular pre-Islamic drums.&lt;ref name=Sachs229&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persian influence brought oboes and [[sitars]], although Persian sitars had three strings and Indian version had from four to seven.&lt;ref name=Sachs231&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic culture also introduced double-[[clarinet]] instruments as the [[Alboka]] (from Arab, al-buq or "horn") nowadays only alive in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Country]]. It must be played using the technique of the circular breathing.

Southeast Asian musical innovations include those during a period of Indian influence that ended around 920 AD.&lt;ref name=Sachs236&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] music made use of [[xylophones]] and [[metallophones]], bronze versions of the former.&lt;ref name=Sachs238&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent and important musical instrument of Southeast Asia was the gong. While the gong likely originated in the geographical area between [[Tibet]] and [[Burma]], it was part of every category of human activity in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] including [[Java]].&lt;ref name=Sachs240&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas of Mesopotamia and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] experiences rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments once they were united by [[Islamic culture]] in the seventh century.&lt;ref name=Sachs246&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music.&lt;ref name=Sachs249&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conical oboes were involved in the music that accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information on the development of [[timpani|kettle drums]] in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java.&lt;ref name=Sachs250&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various lutes, zithers, [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], and harps spread as far as [[Madagascar]] to the south and modern-day [[Sulawesi]] to the east.&lt;ref name=Sachs251&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the influences of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument that may have been invented in Europe until this period.&lt;ref name=Sachs260&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stringed instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with [[Neck (music)|necks]], while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar.&lt;ref name="Sachs260" /&gt; Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol.&lt;ref name=Sachs263&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name=Sachs265&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European music between 800 and 1100 became more sophisticated, more frequently requiring instruments capable of [[polyphony]]. The 9th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], typical instruments included the ''urghun'' ([[Organ (music)|organ]]), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]), ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]) and the [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]].&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine lyra, a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including the [[violin]].&lt;ref name=Grillet29&gt;{{harvnb|Grillet|1901|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[monochord]] served as a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, allowing more accurate musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=Sachs269&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical [[Hurdy gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]] allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Sachs271&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sachs274&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs273&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a [[Leprosy|leper]].&lt;ref name=Sachs278&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth century revealed the first [[bagpipes]], which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs281&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of pneumatic [[Organ (music)|organs]] evolved in Europe starting in fifth-century [[Spain]], spreading to [[England]] in about 700.&lt;ref name=Sachs284&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting instruments varied in size and use from portable organs worn around the neck to large pipe organs.&lt;ref name=Sachs286&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary accounts of organs being played in English [[Benedictine]] abbeys toward the end of the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches.&lt;ref name=Bicknell13&gt;{{harvnb|Bicknell|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to [[oboe]]s; no evidence of [[clarinet]]s exists during this period.&lt;ref name=Sachs288&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===

====Renaissance====
Musical instrument development was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]] from 1400 on, indeed, the most profound changes occurred during the [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref name="Sachs297" /&gt; Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as [[polyphonic]] instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced [[tablature]]. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments.&lt;ref name="Sachs297" /&gt; In the latter half of the sixteenth century, [[orchestration]] came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion.&lt;ref name=Sachs298&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.&lt;ref name=Sachs351&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Duet c1635 by Saftleven.jpg|thumb|''The Duet'', by Dutch painter [[Cornelis Saftleven]], c. 1635]]
Beginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was [[Sebastian Virdung|Sebastian Virdung's]] 1511 treatise ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').&lt;ref name="Sachs298" /&gt; Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of "irregular" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including [[Arnolt Schlick|Arnolt Schlick's]] ''Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten'' ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.&lt;ref name=Sachs299&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]], is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs301&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments – such as the violin – the "classical shapes" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.&lt;ref name=Sachs302&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of ''consorts'', or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.&lt;ref name=Sachs303&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with [[Organ stop|solo stops]] emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.&lt;ref name=Sachs307&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used [[Mute (music)|mutes]] to properly blend into [[chamber music]].&lt;ref name=Sachs328&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baroque====
[[File:Stainer.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque]] mounted [[Jacob Stainer]] violin from 1658]]
Beginning in the seventeenth century, composers began creating works of a more emotional style. They felt that a [[Monophony|monophonic]] style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.&lt;ref name=Sachs351/&gt; As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.&lt;ref name=Sachs352&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowed instruments such as the violin, [[viola]], [[baryton]], and various lutes dominated popular music.&lt;ref name=Sachs353&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=353–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=Sachs374&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the prevalence of [[string orchestra]]s rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.&lt;ref name=Sachs380&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an "art instrument" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range. The details of this transformation are unclear, but the modern [[French horn|horn]] or, more colloquially, French horn, had emerged by 1725.&lt;ref name=Sachs384&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[slide trumpet]] appeared, a variation that includes a long-throated mouthpiece that slid in and out, allowing the player infinite adjustments in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it.&lt;ref name=Sachs385&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals. Sachs viewed this trend as a "degeneration" of the general organ sound.&lt;ref name=Sachs386&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical and Romantic====
During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, a great deal of musical instruments capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.&lt;ref name=Sachs388&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes—most of them unsuccessful—in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a "defective" range—they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.&lt;ref name=Sachs389&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; New instruments such as the clarinet, saxophone, and tuba became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire "families" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.&lt;ref name=Sachs388/&gt;

Accompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average [[concert pitch]] began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.&lt;ref name=Sachs390&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like [[Hector Berlioz]], no standard could be agreed upon.&lt;ref name=Sachs391&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twentieth century to present====
[[File:FGF museum 01. Leo and early models.jpg|thumb|Early [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] electric guitars]]
The evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Remnant183&gt;{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments like the violin, flute, french horn, harp, and so on are largely the same as those manufactured throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Gradual iterations do emerge; for example, the "New Violin Family" began in 1964 to provide differently sized violins to expand the range of available sounds.&lt;ref name=Remnant70&gt;{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slowdown in development was practical response to the concurrent slowdown in orchestra and venue size.&lt;ref name=Sachs445&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this trend in traditional instruments, the development of new musical instruments exploded in the twentieth century. The sheer variety of instruments developed overshadows any prior period.&lt;ref name=Remnant183/&gt;

The proliferation of electricity in the twentieth century lead to the creation of an entirely new category of musical instruments: electronic instruments, or [[electrophone]]s.&lt;ref name=Sachs447&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of electrophones produced in the first half of the twentieth century were what Sachs called "electromechanical instruments". In other words, they have mechanical parts that produce sound vibrations, and those vibrations are picked up and amplified by electrical components. Examples of electromechanical instruments include [[Hammond organ]]s and [[electric guitar]]s.&lt;ref name=Sachs447/&gt; Sachs also defined a subcategory of "radioelectric instruments" such as the [[theremin]], which produces music through the player's hand movements around two antennas.&lt;ref name=Sachs448&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter half of the twentieth century saw the gradual evolution of [[synthesizers]]—instruments that artificially produce sound using analog or digital circuits and microchips. In the late 1960s, [[Bob Moog]] and other inventors began an era of development of commercial synthesizers. One of the first of these instruments was the [[Moog synthesizer]].&lt;ref name=Pinch7&gt;{{harvnb|Pinch|Trocco|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern proliferation of computers and microchips has spawned an entire industry around electronic musical instruments.&lt;ref name=Manning168&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2004|pp=268–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{main|Musical instrument classification}}
There are many different methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the [[Range (music)|range]] of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an [[orchestra]] or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.&lt;ref name=Montagu210&gt;{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.&lt;ref name=Montagu211&gt;{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kartomi176&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of instrument classifications are [[String instrument|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].

===Ancient systems===
An ancient Hindu system named the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written by the sage [[Bharata Muni]] and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and "solid", or non-skin, percussion instruments.&lt;ref name=Montagu211/&gt; This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by [[Johannes de Muris]], who used the terms ''tensibilia'' (stringed instruments), ''inflatibilia'' (wind instruments), and ''percussibilia'' (all percussion instruments).&lt;ref name="Rault190"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] adapted the ''Natya Shastra'' and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: ''chordophones'' (stringed instruments), ''membranophones'' (skin-head percussion instruments), ''aerophones'' (wind instruments), and ''autophones'' (non-skin percussion instruments).&lt;ref name=Montagu211/&gt;

===Hornbostel-Sachs===
[[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term ''autophone'' with ''idiophone''.&lt;ref name=Montagu211/&gt;

The original Hornbostel-Sachs system classified instruments into four main groups:
* [[Idiophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as [[claves]], [[xylophone]], [[guiro]], [[slit drum]], [[mbira]], and [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].&lt;ref name=Marcuse3&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Membranophone]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be [[drums]] (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but [[kazoos]] and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.&lt;ref name=Marcuse117&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chordophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a [[zither]] whether it is plucked like an [[autoharp]] or struck with hammers like a [[piano]]. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a [[lute]], whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a [[guitar]] or uses a membrane like a [[banjo]].&lt;ref name=Marcuse177&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aerophone]]s, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a [[bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]] or [[whip]], which move freely through the air; [[flutes]], which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as [[trumpet]]s, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.&lt;ref name=Marcuse549&gt;{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs later added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.&lt;ref name="Sachs447"/&gt; Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].&lt;ref name="Rault190" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell39"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schaeffner===
Andre Schaeffner, a curator at the [[Musée de l'Homme]], disagreed with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.&lt;ref name=Kartomi174&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
{{main|Range (music)}}
Musical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.

These terms are named after singing voice classifications:
* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[violin]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[piccolo]]
* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto saxophone]], [[french horn]], [[english horn]], [[viola]], [[alto horn]]
* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[guitar]], [[tenor drum]]
* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]]
* [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[contrabassoon]], [[bass saxophone]], [[tuba]], [[bass drum]]

Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], [[alto flute]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example: [[sopranino saxophone]], [[contrabass clarinet]]. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to F♯&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.

==Construction==
[[File:African music instrument made from a can 01.jpg|thumb|African music instrument made from a food can]]
&lt;!--[[Musical instrument construction]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
The materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]].&lt;ref name="Rault184"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The [[Yakuts]] believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.&lt;ref name="Rault185"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a [[luthier]] makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Rault195"&gt;{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop [[experimental musical instrument]]s, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.

==User interfaces==
Regardless of how the sound in an instrument is produced, many musical instruments have a keyboard as the user-interface. [[Keyboard instrument]]s are any instruments that are played with a [[musical keyboard]]. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means ([[Piano#Pedals|pedals]] for a piano, [[Organ stop|stops]] and a [[pedal keyboard]] for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned ([[organ (music)|organ]]) or pumped ([[accordion]]),&lt;ref name="bicknell"&gt;Bicknell, Stephen (1999). "The organ case".

Spectrum IEEE, 34(2):18–33, Dec 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; or in some other way. Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the ''[[glockenspiel]]'', are fitted with one.&lt;ref name="vslglocken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vsl.co.at/en/70/3196/3204/3208/5760.vsl|title=Glockenspiel: Construction|publisher=Vienna Symphonic Library|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they have no moving parts and are struck by mallets held in the player's hands, they have the same physical arrangement of keys and produce soundwaves in a similar manner.  The [[theremin]], an [[electrophone]], is played without physical contact by the player.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3715">The [[United States]] '''National Airspace System Voice Switch''' ('''NVS''') project,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration:NextGen Implementation Plan: Program Reference Sheet for NVS&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] (NextGen), aims to establish a single set of scalable voice switches that can support a dynamic flow of air traffic. Voice communications network flexibility is essential for the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) to increase air traffic control network flexibility.

==Description==
Voice communications is a fundamental part of providing air traffic control services. Both air-to-ground and ground-to-ground voice communications are essential for the [[En-route chart|en route]], flight service and [[TRACON|terminal]] domains of aircraft flights to provide safe, orderly and efficient flow of air traffic.

In the early years of the twenty-first century, [[air traffic control]] air-ground and ground-ground [[Speech|voice communications]] are managed on a [[Geography|geographical]] basis. The equipment used is a mixture of seventeen different types, some already 20 years old.

Current voice communications switches are very static, and the ability to adjust the [[airspace]] for varying loads very limited. An air traffic controller in [[Miami]] in winter time may be over-loaded, whilst in the remainder of the year under-loaded. During the same periods, an air traffic controller in [[Minneapolis]] may be under-loaded in winter, and over-loaded at other times. With an inflexible system, the solution has to be to physically move controllers to cope with the higher workloads.

NVS aims to enable voice switch flexibility by allowing the [[airspace]] to be dynamically reconfigured according to workload, without the physical movement of staff. So, an air traffic controller in Minneapolis could be logically reassigned to Miami without a physical movement being necessary. A migration from [[Analogue electronics|analog]] communications to [[Voip|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VOIP) is also being considered.

==Benefits==
NVS will enable FAA air traffic control to establish a network-based communications system, to evolve towards flexible communications routing that provides dynamic re-sectorisation, resource reallocation, airspace redesign, and improved aircraft flow capacity.

NVS will:
* use [[Open system (computing)|open systems]] standards and/or [[commercial off-the-shelf]] equipment
* reduce equipment [[Inventory|inventories]] of out-of-date switch types
* reduce acquisition, training and maintenance costs by reducing the number of voice switch designs
* improve equipment availability
* enable flexible allocation of access to communications resources to meet both strategic and tactical demands
* enable flexible [[User profile|user access profile]] definitions to assure secure access to the system and to enable defined roles to be performed
* provide [[scalability]]
* provide a [[fault-tolerant system]].

==Development==
Northrop Grumman Corporation announced the demonstration of the company's Next Generation Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Voice Switch to officials of the FAA in preparation for the upcoming National Airspace System Voice Switch program competition. The demonstration was the second phase of Northrop Grumman's response to a Request for Information issued by the FAA for the NVS program.&lt;ref&gt;[Wall Street Journal http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20091116-904357.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OGAS''' ({{lang-ru|Общегосударственная автоматизированная система учёта и обработки информации}}, All-State Automated System) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] project to create a nationwide [[Computer network|information network]]. The project began in 1962 but was denied necessary funding in 1970. It was one of a series of attempts to create a nationwide network analogous to what became the [[Internet]], all of which failed.

The primary architect of OGAS was [[Viktor Glushkov]]. A previous proposal for a national computer network to improve central planning, {{ill|Anatolii Kitov|ru|Китов, Анатолий Иванович}}'s Economic Automated Management System, had been rejected in 1959 because of concerns in the military that they would be required to share information with civilian planners.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite book| last = Peters| first = Benjamin| title = How Not to Network a Nation: The Uneasy History of the Soviet Internet | year = 2016| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 9780262034180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeon&gt;{{cite web| last = Peters| first = Benjamin|editor-first=Sam |editor-last=Dresser | url = https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-soviets-invented-the-internet-and-why-it-didn-t-work| title = The Soviet InterNyet: How the Soviets invented the internet and why it didn't work | website = [[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]] | date = 16 October 2016| accessdate = 19 October 2016 |type=excerpt from ''How Not to Network a Nation''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov proposed OGAS in 1962 as a three-tier network with a computer centre in [[Moscow]], up to 200 midlevel centres in other major cities, and up to 20,000 local terminals in economically significant locations, communicating in real time using the existing telephone infrastructure. The structure would also permit any terminal to communicate with any other. Glushkov further proposed using the system to move the Soviet Union towards a moneyless economy, using the system for electronic payments. The project failed because Glushkov's request for funding on 1 October 1970 was turned down.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeon/&gt; The [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Communist Party Congress]] in 1971 was to have authorised implementation of the plan, but ultimately endorsed only expansion of local information management systems.&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerovitch |first=Slava |authorlink=Slava Gerovitch |last2= |first2= |title=InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network |url=http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-InterNyet.pdf |journal=[[History and Technology]] |date=December 2008 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=335–50 |doi=10.1080/07341510802044736 |issn=0734-1512 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov subsequently pursued another network plan, EGSVT, which was also underfunded and not carried out.&lt;ref name="sov"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Peters |date=2008 |title=Why the Soviet Internet Failed |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit6/papers/BenPeters.pdf |journal=MIT 6 Conference |publisher=[[MIT]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403231924/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit6/papers/BenPeters.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [[Nikolay Fedorenko]] also attempted beginning in 1964 to build an information network to improve economic planning; that project was successful at a micro-level but did not spread into wide use. --&gt; Soviet network plans failed while the American [[ARPANET]] succeeded.

The OGAS proposal was resented by some liberals as excessive central control,&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; but failed primarily because of bureaucratic infighting: it was under the auspices of the [[Central Statistical Administration]] and as such fell afoul of [[Vasily Garbuzov]], who saw a threat to his [[Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Finance]].&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeon/&gt;&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; When [[EGSVT]] failed, the next attempt ([[SOFE]]) was done in 1964 by [[Nikolay Fedorenko]], who attempted to build an information network that could be used in economic planning in Soviet Union's planned economy. The project was successful at a micro-level but did not spread into wide use.&lt;ref name="sov"/&gt;

==Cybernetic economic planning==
Beginning in the early 1960s, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] considered moving away from the existing Stalinist command planning in favor of developing an interlinked computerized system of resource allocation based on the principles of [[Cybernetics]]. This development was seen as the basis for moving toward optimal planning that could form the basis of a more highly developed form of [[socialist economy]] based on informational decentralization and innovation. This was seen as a logical progression given that the [[Material balance planning|material balances system]] was geared toward rapid industrialization, which the Soviet Union had already achieved in the preceding decades. But by the early 1970s the idea of transcending the status quo was abandoned by the Soviet leadership, who felt the system threatened Party control of the economy. By the early 1970s official interest in this system ended.&lt;ref name="InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network"&gt;''InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network'', by Gerovitch, Slava.

'''Poetic contractions''' are archaic and obsolete contractions of words not commonly used today in modern English, but are still found used extensively in early modern English poetry, particular that of [[William Shakespeare]]. The extent to which the usage of poetic contractions really helps with matching poetic meters is negligible, and modern readers prefer to substitute the contractions with the actual words they imply for clarity, rather than adhere to obsolete words for the purpose of archaic nostalgia.

In the modern English of today, poetic contractions tend to sound unsophisticated, poor, and uneducated to modern readers, since [[contracted word]]s are most often used in modern English to indicate colloquy accidents of poor country folks (for example, the colloquial English in the writings of [[Mark Twain]]).

'''Pop music''' is a genre of [[popular music]] that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=Firth2001/&gt; The terms "popular music" and "pop music" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles. "Pop" and "[[Rock music|rock]]" were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they became increasingly differentiated from each other.

Although much of the music that appears on [[record chart]]s is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Pop music is eclectic, and often borrows elements from other styles such as [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[dance music|dance]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], and [[country music|country]]; nonetheless, there are core elements that define pop music. Identifying factors include generally short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the [[verse–chorus form|verse-chorus structure]]), as well as common use of repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and [[hook (music)|hooks]].

==Definitions and etymology{{anchor|Etymology}}==
David Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as "a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk musics".&lt;ref&gt;D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), {{ISBN|0719014891}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Pete Seeger]], pop music is "professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music".&lt;ref name=pc1&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19745/m1/ |title=Show 1 - Play A Simple Melody: Pete Seeger on the origins of pop music}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although pop music is seen as just the [[record chart|singles charts]], it is not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[novelty song]]s. As a genre, Pop music is seen to exist and develop separately.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serge Denisoff and William L. Schurk, ''Tarnished Gold: the Record Industry Revisited'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 3rd edn., 1986), {{ISBN|0887386180}}, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the term "pop music" may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as "instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers" in contrast to rock music as "album-based music for adults".&lt;ref name=Firth2001/&gt;{{refn|Musicologist Allan Moore surmises that the term "pop music" itself may have been popularized by [[Pop art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Moore|first=Allan F.|title=Song Means: Analysing and Interpreting Recorded Popular Song|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6DeCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317052654}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pop music continuously evolves along with the term's definition. According to ''The New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians'', popular music is defined as "the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class."&lt;ref name="What Is Pop Music"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-pop-music-3246980|title=What Is Pop Music?|access-date=|last = Lamb |first =Bill|website = ThoughtCo.|date = 29 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pop song" was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music "having popular appeal".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;J. Simpson and E. Weiner, ''Oxford English Dictionary''(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989). {{ISBN|0198611862}}, cf. pop.&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in [[country music|country]], [[blues]], and [[hillbilly music]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'', {{ISBN|0719014891}}, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Rolling stones - 11 luglio 2006 - san siro.jpg|thumb|left|''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'' states that the term "pop" refers to music performed by such artists as  [[the Rolling Stones]] (pictured here in a 2006 performance)]]

According to the website of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', called '''Grove Music Online''', the term "pop music" "originated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the mid-1950s as a description for [[rock and roll]] and the new youth music styles that it influenced".&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;R. Middleton, et al., [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo "Pop"], ''Grove music online'', retrieved 14 March 2010. {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'' states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[ABBA]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;"Pop", [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_t237 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music''], retrieved 9 March 2010.{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grove Music Online'' also states that "[...] in the early 1960s, [the term] 'pop music' competed terminologically with [[beat music]] [in England], while in the US its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and roll'".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

From about 1967, the term “pop music” was increasingly used in opposition to the term [[rock music]], a division that gave generic significance to both terms.&lt;ref name=Gloag983&gt;Kenneth Gloag in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0198662122}}, p. 983.&lt;/ref&gt; While rock aspired to [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music,&lt;ref name=Gloag983/&gt; pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.&lt;ref name=Warner2003&gt;T. Warner, ''Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|075463132X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to British musicologist [[Simon Frith]], pop music is produced "as a matter of [[business|enterprise]] not art", and is "designed to appeal to everyone" but "doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste". Frith adds that it is "not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative". It is, "provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below&amp;nbsp;... Pop is not a [[DIY|do-it-yourself]] music but is professionally produced and packaged".&lt;ref name="Firth2001"/&gt; {{clear}}

According to Frith, characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology, and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal "artistic" qualities.&lt;ref name=Firth2001/&gt; Music scholar Timothy Warner said it typically has an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, rather than live performance; a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than [[progressive music|progressive developments]]; and aims to encourage dancing or uses dance-oriented rhythms.&lt;ref name=Warner2003/&gt;

The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable [[rhythm|rhythmic element]], a mainstream style and a simple traditional [[song structure (popular music)|structure]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Everett, ''Expression in Pop-rock Music: A Collection of Critical and Analytical Essays'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the [[thirty-two-bar form]], with a focus on [[melody|melodies]] and catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], and a [[refrain|chorus]] that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and [[harmony|harmonically]] with the [[Verse (music)|verse]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Performance and production'' (Continuum, 2003), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt; The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kramarz, ''The Pop Formulas: Harmonic Tools of the Hit Makers'' (Mel Bay Publications, 2007), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes&amp;nbsp;– often love and romantic relationships&amp;nbsp;– although there are notable exceptions.&lt;ref name=Firth2001/&gt;

[[Harmony (music)|Harmony]] and [[chord progression]]s in pop music are often "that of [[Classical music|classical]] European [[tonality]], only more simple-minded."&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Peter (1978). "Toward a theory of pop harmony", ''In Theory Only'', 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Clichés include the [[close and open harmony|barbershop quartet-style harmony]] (i.e. ii – V – I) and [[blues scale]]-influenced harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Sargeant, p. 198. cited in Winkler (1978), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the [[circle of fifths]] between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, including less predominance for the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] [[diatonic function|function]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkler (1978), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on the [[sentimental ballad]] for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]], instrumentation from [[jazz]] and [[rock music]], orchestration from [[classical music]], tempo from [[dance music]], backing from [[electronic music]], rhythmic elements from [[hip-hop music]], and spoken passages from [[rap music|rap]].&lt;ref name=Firth2001&gt;S. Frith, W. Straw, and J. Street, eds, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0521556600}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–105.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=February 2017}}

In the 1960s, the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Arrangements—A Rough Guide To Song Construction &amp; Arrangement, Part 1 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/oct97/arranging1.html |work=Sound on Sound |accessdate=8 May 2014 |date=October 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508082609/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/oct97/arranging1.html |archivedate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, [[orchestration]], [[reverberation|unnatural reverb]], and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] and [[Joe Meek]]'s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like [[the Tornados]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Andrew|editor-last1=Cook|editor-first1=Nicholas|editor-last2=Clarke|editor-first2=Eric|editor-last3=Leech-Wilkinson|editor-first3=Daniel|title=The Cambridge Companion to Recorded Music|chapter=Recording practices and the role of the producer|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb0hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139827966|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined [[Tin Pan Alley]] to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched rock guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=October 31, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/arts/music/01pupp.html?_r=0|title=Orchestral Pop, the Way It Was (More or Less)|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word "progressive" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a "progression" from the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Paolo|last2=Hellier|first2=John|title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxhzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT162|year=2015|publisher=Dean Street Press|isbn=978-1910570692|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music journalism|Music critic]] [[Simon Reynolds]] writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between "progressive" pop and "mass/chart" pop, a separation which was "also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Reynolds|title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lauJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134939510|chapter=New Pop and its Aftermath|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[progressive pop]] of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Willis|first=Paul E.|authorlink=Paul Willis|title=Profane Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7oWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219|year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400865147|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by the mid-1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them the freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing.{{sfn|Moore|2016|p=202}} This situation fell in disuse after the late 1970s and would not reemerge until the rise of [[Internet]] stars.{{sfn|Moore|2016|p=202}} [[Indie pop]], which developed in the late 1970s, marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, with guitar bands formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a [[record contract]] from a major label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |first=Nitsuh |last=Abebe |work=Pitchfork Media |date=24 October 2005 |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6176-twee-as-fuck/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wjlLnVho?url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6176-twee-as-fuck/ |archivedate=24 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, pop music worldwide had been permeated by [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref name="Christgau"/&gt;

In May 2018, researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]], concluded that pop music has become 'sadder' over the last 30 years.

In the 1940s improved [[microphone]] design allowed a more intimate singing style&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; and ten or twenty years later, inexpensive and more durable 45 r.p.m. records for singles "revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated". This helped to move pop music to 'a record/radio/film star system'.&lt;ref name=Buckley&gt;D. Buckley, "Pop" "II. Implications of technology", ''Grove Music Online'', retrieved 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s; with televised performances, "pop stars had to have a visual presence".&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable [[transistor radio]]s meant that First World teenagers could listen to music outside of the home.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; [[Multi-track recording]] (from the 1960s); and [[sampling (music)|digital sampling]] (from the 1980s) have also been utilized as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music.&lt;ref name=Firth2001/&gt; By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like [[MTV]], which "favoured those artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] who had a strong visual appeal".&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

In general, the Old Guard of rock critics and journalists is depicted as a bunch of bricklayers for the foundations of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. True in part, which is to say, false. Like film studies, rock criticism of the late ‘60s and the ‘70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study; it was poptimism before its day."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loss|first1=Robert|title=No Apologies: A Critique of the Rockist v.

Pop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British [[music industry|music industries]], whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture, but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;J.

According to ''Grove Music Online'', "Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures".&lt;ref name=PManuel&gt;P. Manuel, "Pop. Non-Western cultures 1.

{{Punjabis}}
The '''Punjabis''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{Lang|pnb|{{Nastaliq|پنجابی}}}}, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ) or '''Punjabi people''' are an [[ethnic group]] associated with the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] region in [[South Asia]], specifically in the northern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], presently divided between [[Punjab, India]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan]]. They speak [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], a language from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;pg=PA 522|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-087775-4|pages=522–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Punjab literally means the ''land of five waters'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]: panj ("five") āb ("waters").&lt;ref name="Gandhi 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Punjab: A History from Aurangzeb to Mountbatten|year=2013|publisher=Aleph Book Company|location=New Delhi, India, Urbana, [[Illinois]]|isbn=978-93-83064-41-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the region was introduced by the [[Turko-Persian]] conquerors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canfield|first=Robert L.|title=Persia in Historical Perspective|year=1991|page=1 ("Origins")|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=[[Cambridge]], United Kingdom&lt;!--|isbn=0-521-39094-X--&gt;|isbn=0-521-52291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Indian subcontinent.

The coalescence of the various tribes, castes and the inhabitants of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] into a broader common "Punjabi" identity initiated from the onset of the 18th century CE. Prior to that the sense and perception of a common "Punjabi" ethno-cultural identity and community did not exist, even though the majority of the various communities of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] had long shared linguistic, cultural and racial commonalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malhotra|first=edited by Anshu|title=Punjab reconsidered : history, culture, and practice|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=9780198078012|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/punjab-reconsidered-history-culture-and-practice-9780198078012;jsessionid=67C0F3362215BC7FE368DF643C70CA16?cc=de&amp;lang=en&amp;|author2=Mir, Farina }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayers|first=Alyssa|title=Language, the Nation, and Symbolic Capital: The Case of Punjab|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|year=2008|volume=67|issue=3|pages=917–46|url=http://alyssaayres.com/pdf/Ayres-JAS-Language-Nation.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0021911808001204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thandi|first=edited and introduced by Pritam Singh and Shinder S.|title=Globalisation and the region : explorations in Punjabi identity|year=1996|publisher=Association for Punjab Studies (UK)|location=Coventry, United Kingdom|isbn=1874699054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Punjabi identity is primarily linguistic, geographical and cultural. Its identity is independent of historical origin or religion, and refers to those who reside in the [[Punjab region]], or associate with its population, and those who consider the [[Punjabi language]] their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thandi|first=edited by Pritam Singh, Shinder Singh|title=Punjabi identity in a global context|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=019-564-8641}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[social integration|Integration]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] are important parts of Punjabi culture, since Punjabi identity is not based solely on tribal connections. More or less all Punjabis share the same cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Prtiam|title='Globalisation and Punjabi Identity: Resistance, Relocation and Reinvention (Yet Again!)'|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|year=2012|volume= 19|issue= 2|pages=153–72|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v19_2/Singh.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krysstal.com/langfams_indoeuro.html |title=Languages : Indo-European Family |publisher=Krysstal.com |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Punjabi people were a [[heterogeneous]] group and were subdivided into a number of clans called ''[[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradari]]'' (literally meaning "brotherhood") or ''[[Punjabi tribes|tribes]]'', with each person bound to a clan. However, Punjabi identity also included those who did not belong to any of the historical tribes. With the passage of time, tribal structures are coming to an end and are being replaced with a more cohesive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albert V.|first=Carron|author2=Lawrence R.

===Sikh era Punjab===
In the 19th century, [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] established a [[Sikh Empire|Punjabi kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/IDE822/ |title=Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign by K.S.

The main geographical footprint of the country was the [[Punjab region]] to [[Khyber Pass]] in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to [[Sindh]] in the south, and [[Tibet]] in the east. The religious [[demography]] of the Kingdom was [[Islam|Muslim]] (70%), [[Sikhism|Sikh]] (17%), [[Hinduism|Hindu]] (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/IDE822/ |title=Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign by K.S.

In 1799 Ranjit Singh moved the capital to [[Lahore]] from [[Gujranwala]], where it had been established in 1763 by his grandfather, [[Charat Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=j894miuOqc4C&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=gujranwala+capital#v=onepage&amp;q=gujranwala%20capital&amp;f=false|title=World and Its Peoples: Middle East, Western Asia, and Northern Africa|year=2007|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=9780761475712|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punjab region]] was a region straddling India and the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Durrani Empire]]. The following modern-day political divisions made up the historical Punjabi kingdom:
[[File:Sikh Empire tri-lingual.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Map showing the Punjabi Sikh Empire.]]

After Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. This opportunity was used by the [[British East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]]. The country was finally annexed and dissolved at the end of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849 into separate [[princely states]] and the British [[Punjab (British India)|province of Punjab]]. Eventually, a Lieutenant Governorship was formed in Lahore as a direct representative of the [[British Crown]].

===Partition of Punjab===
[[File:Punjab map (topographic) with cities.png|thumb|left|The [[Punjab region]], with its rivers. The land of the Punjabi People]]
The 1947 independence of India and Pakistan, and the subsequent partition of Punjab, is considered by historians to be the beginning of the end of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Trevor Owen|last=Lloyd|title=The British Empire 1558–1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-19-873134-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gIBgQgAACAAJ|ref=refLloyd1996|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNHCR]] estimates 14 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were [[Refugee|displaced]] during the partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rupture in South Asia| url = http://www.unhcr.org/3ebf9bab0.pdf |publisher=UNHCR| accessdate = 23 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this is considered the largest [[mass migration]] in human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Hidden Story of Partition and its Legacies|author=Dr Crispin Bates |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/partition1947_01.shtml|work=BBC|date= 23 December 2015|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1947, the province of Punjab was ruled by a coalition comprising the [[Indian National Congress]], the Sikh-led [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] and the [[Unionist Muslim League]]. However, the growth of Muslim nationalism led to the [[All India Muslim League]] becoming the dominant party in the 1946 elections. As Muslim separatism increased, the opposition from Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs increased substantially. Communal violence on the eve of Indian independence led to the dismissal of the coalition government, although the succeeding League ministry was unable to form a majority. Along with the province of Bengal, Punjab was partitioned on religious lines – the Muslim-majority West becoming part of the new Muslim state of Pakistan, and the Hindu and Sikh East remaining in India. Partition was accompanied by massive violence on both sides, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ishtiaq|title=The Punjab bloodied, partitioned and cleansed : unravelling the 1947 tragedy through secret British reports and first-person accounts|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi|isbn=0199064709}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Punjab was virtually cleansed of its Hindu and Sikh populations, who were forced to leave for India, while East Punjab and Delhi were virtually cleansed of their Muslim population.

By the 1960s, Indian Punjab underwent reorganisation as demands for a linguistic Punjabi state increased (in line with the policy of [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|linguistic states]] that had been applied in the rest of India). The Hindi-speaking areas were formed into the states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Haryana]] respectively, leaving a Punjabi speaking majority in the state of Punjab. In the 1980s, Sikh separatism combined with popular anger against the [[Indian Army]]'s counter-insurgency operations (especially [[Operation Bluestar]]) led to violence and disorder in Indian Punjab, which only subsided in the 1990s. Political power in Indian Punjab is contested between the secular Congress Party and the Sikh religious party Akali Dal and its allies, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Indian Punjab remains one of the most prosperous of India's states and is considered the "breadbasket of India."

Subsequent to partition, West Punjabis made up a majority of the Pakistani population, and the Punjab province constituted 40% of Pakistan's total land mass. Today, Punjabis continue to be the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, accounting for half of the country's population. They reside predominantly in the province of Punjab, neighboring [[Azad Kashmir]] and in [[Islamabad Capital Territory]]. Punjabis are also found in large communities in the largest city of Pakistan, [[Karachi]], located in the [[Sindh]] province.

Punjabis in India can be found in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and the [[Union Territory]] of [[Chandigarh]]. Large communities of Punjabis are also found in the [[Jammu]] region of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and in [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].

===Punjabis in Pakistan===
Punjabis are numbered as 110,012,442, which make 55% of the population of Pakistan, and they are the [[Ethnic groups of Pakistan|largest ethnic group in Pakistan]] by population. The Punjabis found in Pakistan belong to groups known as biradaris. In addition, Punjabi society is divided into two divisions, the zamindar groups or qoums, traditionally associated with farming and the moeens, who are traditionally artisans. Some zamindars are further divided into groups such as the [[Punjabi Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Muslim Jats|Jats]], [[Punjabi Shaikh|Shaikhs]] or Muslim [[Khatri]]s, [[Gujjar]]s, [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awans]], [[Arain]]s and [[Syed]]s. People from neighbouring regions, such as [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiris]], [[Punjabi Pathan|Pashtuns]] and [[Punjabi Baloch|Baluch]], also form sizeable portion of the Punjabi population. A large number of punjabis descend from the groups historically associated with skilled professions and crafts such as [[Sunar]], [[Lohar]], [[Kumhar]], [[Tarkhan]], [[Julaha]], [[Mochi]], [[Hajjam]], [[Chhimba Darzi]], [[Muslim Teli|Teli]], Lalari, [[Qassab]], [[Mallaah]], [[Dhobi]], [[Mirasi]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim Peoples: A World Ethnographic Survey'' Richard V. Weekes, editor-in-chief Greenwood Press 1978&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}

Punjabi people have traditionally and historically been farmers and soldiers,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} which has transferred into modern times with their dominance of agriculture and military fields in Pakistan. In addition, Punjabis in Pakistan have been quite prominent politically, having had many elected members of parliament. Punjabis in Pakistan have shown a predilection towards the adoption of the Urdu language but nearly all speak Punjabi, and still identify themselves as ethnic Punjabis.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Religious homogeneity remains elusive as a predominant [[Sunni]] population with [[Shia]], [[Ahmadiyya]] and Christian minorities. A variety of related sub-groups exist in Pakistan and are often considered by many Pakistani Punjabis to be simply regional Punjabis including the [[Seraiki people|Seraikis]] (who overlap and are often considered transitional with the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]]).

The recent definition of Punjabi people, in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]], is not based on [[Race (classification of humans)|racial classification]], [[Common descent|common ancestry]] or [[endogamy]], but based on geographical and cultural basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Punjabis in India===

The Punjabi-speaking people make 2.8% of India's population as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Key Facts on India: Essential Information on [https://books.google.com/books?id=TYHjssGl-KgC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq India]&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Indian Punjabis is unknown due to the fact that ethnicity is not recorded in the [[Census of India]]. The Sikhs are largely concentrated in the modern-day state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] forming 57.7% of the population with Hindus forming 38.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Census-2011-age-of-Sikhs-drops-in-Punjab-migration-to-blame/articleshow/48689317.cms|title=Census 2011: %age of Sikhs drops in Punjab; migration to blame?|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 35% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly [[Hindi]]-speaking [[Punjabi Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.indiatvnews.com/politics/national/delhi-assembly-elections-2015-important-facts-and-stakeholders-25298.html|title=Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: Important Facts And Major Stakeholders Mobile Site|author=indiatvnews|date=6 February 2015|work=India TV News|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/mobi/news/sunday-special/perspective/why-punjabis-are-central-to-delhi-election/36387.html|title=Why Punjabis are central to Delhi election|author=Jupinderjit Singh|date=|work=tribuneindia.com/news/sunday-special/perspective/why-punjabis-are-central-to-delhi-election/36387.html|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanjay2008"/&gt; In [[Chandigarh]], 80.78% people of the population are Hindus, 13.11% are Sikhs, 4.87% are Muslims and minorities are Christians, Buddhists and Jains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW04C-01%20MDDS.XLS&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Punjabi Muslim society, these various [[caste system in India|castes]] are associated with particular occupations or crafts.

Indian Punjab is also home to small groups of Muslims and Christians. Most of the [[East Punjab]]'s Muslims ''(in today's states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Chandigarh)'' left for West Punjab in 1947. However, a small community still exists today, mainly in [[Qadian]],and [[Malerkotla]], the only Muslim princely state among the seven that formed the erstwhile [[Patiala]] and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). The other six ''(mostly Sikh)'' states were: Patiala, [[Nabha]], [[Jind]], [[Faridkot, India|Faridkot]], [[Kapurthala]] and [[Kalsia]].

The Indian censuses record the native languages, but not the descent of the citizens. Linguistic data cannot accurately predict ethnicity: for example, Punjabis make up a large portion of Delhi's population but many descendants of the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Hindu]] refugees who came to Delhi following the [[partition of India]] now speak Hindi as their first language. Thus, there is no concrete official data on the [[Ethnic groups in Delhi|ethnic makeup of Delhi]] and other Indian states.&lt;ref name="Sanjay2008"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sanjay Yadav | title=The Invasion of Delhi | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTBBL1q5C_EC&amp;pg=PA10 | year=2008 | publisher=Worldwide Books | isbn=978-81-88054-00-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–10}}

The Punjab region within India maintains a strong influence on the perceived culture of India towards the rest of the world. Numerous Bollywood film productions use the Punjabi language in their songs and dialogue as well as traditional dances such as [[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]. [[Bollywood]] has been dominated by Punjabi artists including actors such as the [[Kapoor family]], [[Dev Anand]], [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Pran (actor)|Pran]], [[Prem Chopra]], [[Manoj Kumar]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Vinod Khanna]], [[Kabir Bedi]], [[Vinod Mehra]], [[Pankaj Kapur]], [[Sunny Deol]], [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Poonam Dhillon]], [[Juhi Chawla]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Arjun Kapoor]], [[Sonam Kapoor]], [[Ranbir Kapoor]], [[Shahid Kapoor]], [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], [[Parineeti Chopra]] and [[Sidharth Malhotra]], singers [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Mahendra Kapoor]], [[Narendra Chanchal]], [[Sukhwinder Singh]], [[Daler Mehndi]], [[Mika Singh]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Yo Yo Honey Singh]], and [[Kanika Kapoor]]. Punjabi Prime Ministers of India include [[Gulzarilal Nanda]], [[Inder Kumar Gujral]] and [[Manmohan Singh]]. There are numerous players in the Indian cricket team both past and present including [[Lala Amarnath]], [[Bishen Singh Bedi]], [[Kapil Dev]], [[Rajinder Singh Ghai]], [[Yograj Singh]], [[Mohinder Amarnath]], [[Navjot Sidhu]], [[Harbhajan Singh]], [[Yuvraj Singh]], [[Virat Kohli]] and [[Shikhar Dhawan]].

===Punjabi diaspora===
{{Main|Punjabi diaspora}}
The Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers to many parts of the world. In the early 20th century, many Punjabis began settling in the United States, including independence activists who formed the [[Ghadar Party]]. The United Kingdom has a significant number of Punjabis from both Pakistan and India. The most populous areas being London, Birmingham and Glasgow. In Canada (specifically [[Vancouver]] and [[Toronto]]) and the United States, (specifically California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]). In the 1970s, a large wave of emigration of Punjabis (predominately from Pakistan) began to the Middle East, in places such as the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. There are also large communities in East Africa including the countries of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]. Punjabis have also emigrated to Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia including [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], Singapore and Hong Kong. Of recent times many Punjabis have also moved to Italy.

===Punjabi homeland===
According to Pippa Virdee, the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan has shadowed the sense of loss of what used to be a homeland nation for the Punjabi people in the Indian subcontinent and its diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eltringham|first1=Nigel|last2=Maclean|first2=Pam|title=Remembering Genocide|year= 2014| publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9781317754213| page='No man's land'|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6OfpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid 1980s, there has been a drive for Punjabi cultural revival, consolidation of Punjabi ethnicity and a virtual Punjabi nation.&lt;ref name="Punjabi Identity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Stewart|last2=Taylor|first2=Wal|last3=Yu|first3=Xinghuo|title=Encyclopedia of Developing Regional Communities With Information And Communication Technology|year=2005|publisher=Idea Group|isbn=9781591407911 |page=409| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eF-TFVrLUL0C&amp;pg=PA409| accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Giorgio Shani, this is predominantly a Sikh ethno-nationalism movement led by some Sikh organizations, and a view that is not shared by Punjabi people organizations belonging to other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=1–8, 86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Punjab==
{{Main|History of Punjab}}
[[File:Surrender of Porus to the Emperor Alexander.jpg|right|thumb|upright|One of the first known kings of ancient Punjab, [[King Porus]]  who fought with Alexander]]
Indigenous population flourished in this region, leading to a developed civilisation in 5th to 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/pakistan/taxila/index.php |title=Taxila, Pakistan: Traditional and Historical Architecture |publisher=Orientalarchitecture.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Also [[Buddhism]] remnants have been found like [[Mankiala]] which corroborate the Buddhist background of this region as well.The remains of the ancient city of [[Taxila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/ta-td/taxila/taxila.htm |title=Taxila |publisher=Livius.org |date=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many ornaments that have been found in this region, suggests that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harappa.com/har/har0.html |title=Indus Valley Civilization |publisher=Harappa.com |date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the centres of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was established at many parts of Punjab, most notably [[Taxila]] and [[Harappa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harappa.com/ |title=The Ancient Indus Valley and the British Raj in India and Pakistan |publisher=Harappa.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Punjab region|Punjab]] became a center of early civilisation from around 3300 BC. During the [[Vedic period|Vedic Era]] The earliest text of [[Rigveda]] were composed in greater Punjab (northwest India and Pakistan) region.&lt;ref name="Joel Brereton 2014 page 5"&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Historians this region was ruled by many small kingdoms and tribes around 4th and 5th BCE. The earliest known notable local king of this region was known as '''[[King Porus]]'''&lt;ref name="livius.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/pn-po/porus/porus.htm |title=Porus |publisher=Livius.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.padfield.com/1993/alex.html |title=Alexander The Great in India at Jhelum with Porus, the Indian rajah |publisher=Padfield.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he fought a famous [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=__start__ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuxjoGJZmKQ |title=Battle of Hydaspes ( Jhelum Punjab)_Alexander vs Porus ( Local King in Punjab, Former North India) |publisher=YouTube |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Alexander. His kingdom, known as '''[[Pauravas]]''', was situated between Hydaspes (modern [[Jhelum]]) and Acesines (modern day [[Chenab]]).&lt;ref name="livius.org"/&gt; These kings fought local battles to gain more ground.[[Taxiles]] or '''[[Taxiles|Omphis]]''' another local king from Punjab, wanted to defeat his eastern adversary [[King Porus|Porus]] in a [[wikt:turf war|turf war]] and he invited [[Alexander the Great]] to defeat Porus. This marked the first intrusion of the West in the Indian subcontinent and Indus valley in general. But such was the valor of Porus and his kingdom forces in Punjab, that despite being defeated, he was appreciated by [[Alexander the Great]] for his skill and valor and he was granted further territories in the North.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The other local kings did not like the fact that Porus was now an ally of Western forces. In less than ten years an Indian king '''[[Chandragupta Maurya]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/page.php?p=8542 |title=Biographies: Chandragupta Maurya :: 0 A.D. |publisher=Wildfire Games |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeated the forces and conquered the Northern Indian regions up to the Kabul river (in modern-day [[Afghanistan]]). Alexander mostly ruled this land with the help of local allies like [[King Porus|Porus]].&lt;ref name="Kivisild et al. 2003"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kivisild et al.|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries later, areas of the Punjab region were ruled by local kings followed by the [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurids]], [[Mughals]], and others. Islam arrived in Punjab when the [[Muslim]] [[Umayyad]] army led by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered Sindh in 711 AD, by defeating [[Raja Dahir]]. Some of the Muslims are said to have settled in the region and adopted the local culture. Centuries later, the Ghaznavids introduced aspects of foreign Persian and Turkic culture in Punjab.

[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the sites and extent of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. [[Harappa]] was the centre of one of the core regions of the Indus Valley Civilization, located in central [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The [[Harappan architecture]] and Harrapan Civilization was one of the most developed in the old [[Bronze Age]].]]

The earliest written Punjabi dates back to the writing of [[Sufi]] Muslim poets of the 11th Century. Its literature spread Punjab's unique voice of peace and spirituality to the entire civilisation of the region.

Regions of North India and Punjab were annexed into the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]] later on in 1747, being a vulnerable target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZk9XzqCFGUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=durrani+empire+conquers+punjab&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kmKVVIHcD8mqU6KwgZAD&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=durrani%20empire%20conquers%20punjab&amp;f=false|title=The History of Afghanistan|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1758, the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] captured most of Punjab including Lahore during its [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|northwest expansion campaign]]. After conquering Peshawar and Attock, the Marathas defeated the Durrani Empire in the [[Battle of Lahore (1759)|Battle of Lahore]] fought in 1759.The region was lost to the Durranis, however, after the [[Third Battle of Panipat]]. The grandson of Ahmed Shah Durrani ([[Zaman Shah Durrani]]), lost it to [[Ranjit Singh]], a Punjabi Sikh. He was born in 1780 to Maha Singh and Raj Kaur in [[Gujranwala]], Punjab. Ranjit took a leading role in organising a Sikh militia and got control of the Punjab region from Zaman Shah Durrani. Ranjit started a Punjabi military expedition to expand his territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Category: The Sikh Empire [1799 – 1839] |url=http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/the-sikh-empire-1799-1839/army-of-maharaja-ranjit-singh |title=ARMY OF MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH – The Sikh Empire [1799 – 1839&amp;#93; |publisher=Thesikhencyclopedia.com |date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his command the Sikh army began invading neighbouring territories outside of Punjab. The [[Jamrud Fort]] at the entry of [[Khyber Pass]] was built by Ranjit Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softserv-intl.com/oldPakistan/photos/photo6.html |title=Jamrud Fort 1870 |publisher=Softserv-intl.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh Empire slowly began to weaken after the death of [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] at the [[Battle of Jamrud]] in 1837. Two years later, in 1839, Ranjit Singh died and his son took over control of the empire. By 1850 the [[Company rule in India|British]] took over control of the Punjab region after defeating the Sikhs in the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstanglosikhwar.com/ |title=thefirstanglosikhwar.com |publisher=thefirstanglosikhwar.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/postgurus/Sikh%20Wars/sikhwars.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing their rule over the region for around the next 100 years as a part of the [[British Raj]]. Many Sikhs and Punjabis later pledged their allegiance to the British, serving as sepoys (native soldiers) within the Raj.

==Religions==

{{Main|Sikhism|Sufism}}
In ancient and the medieval era, before the arrival of Islam into the Indian subcontinent, Hinduism and Buddhism were the predominant religion in the Punjab region. After Islamic conquest, conversions began leading to a mixed population of Muslims and Hindus, and Buddhism vanished.&lt;ref name="Mcleod"&gt;''McLeod, John, "The History of India", Greenwood Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-313-31459-4}}, pg. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muhammad ibn Ahmad Biruni|author2=Edward C.

Due to religious tensions, emigration between Punjabi people started far before the partition and dependable records.&lt;ref&gt;Jones. (2006).

The great uprising in India, 1857–58: Untold stories, Indian and British (worlds of the east India company). Boydell Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly prior to the Partition of [[British India]], Punjab had a slight majority [[Muslim]] population at about 53.2% in 1941, which was an increase from the previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_1/6_krishan.pdf|title=Journal of Punjab Studies – Center for Sikh and Punjab Studies – UC Santa Barbara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the division of Punjab and the subsequent independence of Pakistan and later India, mass migrations of [[Muslims]] from Indian Punjab to Pakistan, and those of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] from [[Pakistan]] to Indian Punjab occurred.
Today, the majority of Pakistani Punjabis follow [[Islam]] with a small Christian minority, while the majority of Indian Punjabis are either [[Sikh]]s or [[Hindu]]s with a [[Muslim]] minority. Punjab is also the birthplace of [[Sikhism]] and the movement [[Ahmadiyya]].&lt;ref name="alislam.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/ |title=Ahmadiyya – Ahmadiyya Community – Al Islam Online – Official Website |publisher=Alislam.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the independence of Pakistan and the subsequent [[Partition of India|partition of British India]], a process of population exchange took place in 1947 as Muslims began to leave [[India]] and headed to the newly created Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs left [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.cet.edu/earthinfo/sasia/SAhis.html South Asia: British India Partitioned] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102060502/http://www.cet.edu/earthinfo/sasia/SAhis.html |date=2 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the newly created state of India.&lt;ref&gt;Avari, B.

===Punjabi Muslims===
{{See also|Punjabi Muslims}}
In 2017 places the total population of [[Punjabi Muslims]] to be 110,012,442 (~75% of all Punjabis), with 97% of Punjabis who live in Pakistan following Islam, in contrast to Punjabi Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus who predominantly live in India.&lt;ref name="Harrison2007p132"/&gt;

A variety of Muslim dynasties and kingdoms ruled the Punjab region, including [[Ghaznavids]] under [[Mahmud of Ghazni]],&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;[[John Esposito|John Louis Esposito]], ''Islam the Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 15 January 1998, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Abdullah Yusuf (1991). The Holy Quran. Medina: King Fahd Holy Qur-an Printing Complex, pg. 507&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire]] and finally the [[Durrani Empire]]. The province became an important centre and Lahore was made into a second capital of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region.

Today [[Punjabi Hindu]]s are mostly found in [[Punjab, India|Indian Punjab]] where they make around 38% of the population and in neighboring states like [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Delhi]], which together forms a part of the historical greater [[Punjab region]]. Many of the Hindu Punjabis from the Indian capital [[Delhi]] are immigrants and their descendants, from various parts of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Western Pakistani Punjab]]. Some Punjabi Hindus can also be found in the surrounding areas as well as the recent cosmopolitan migrants in other big cities like [[Mumbai]]. There has also been continuous migration of Punjabi Hindus to western countries like USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, European Union, UAE and UK.

The total number of Punjabi Christians in Pakistan is approximately 2,800,000 and 300,000 in Indian Punjab. Of these, approximately half are [[Roman Catholic]] and half Protestant.

The team's composition is a reflection of the [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|New South Africa]] racial integration policies]]
'''Racial integration''', or simply '''integration''', includes [[desegregation]] (the process of ending systematic [[racial segregation]]). In addition to desegregation, integration includes goals such as leveling barriers to association, creating [[equal opportunity]] regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and the development of a [[culture]] that draws on diverse traditions, rather than merely bringing a racial [[minority group|minority]] into the [[majority]] culture. Desegregation is largely a legal matter, integration largely a social one.

==Distinguishing ''integration'' from ''desegregation''==
[[File:Nch children parade.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A white child and black child together at a parade in [[North College Hill, Ohio]], USA]]
Morris J. MacGregor, Jr. in his paper "Integration of the Armed Forces 1940-1969" writes concerning the words ''integration'' and ''desegregation'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;...In recent years many historians have come to distinguish between these like-sounding words.. The movement toward desegregation, breaking down the nation's [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system, became increasingly popular in the decade after [[World War II]]. Integration, on the other hand, Professor [[Oscar Handlin]] maintains, implies several things not yet necessarily accepted in all areas of American society. In one sense it refers to the "levelling of all barriers to association other than those based on ability, taste, and personal preference";&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;Morris J. MacGregor, Jr. [http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-FM.htm Integration of the Armed Forces 1940-1965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721102246/http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/iaf-fm.htm |date=2010-07-21 }}, [[United States Army Center of Military History]], Washington D.C. (1985).  The linked copy is on the Army's official site. The Handlin quote is footnoted within the MacGregor piece as Oscar Handlin, "The Goals of Integration", Daedalus 95 (Winter 1966): 270.&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, providing equal opportunity. But in another sense integration calls for the random distribution of a minority throughout society. Here, according to Handlin, the emphasis is on racial balance in areas of occupation, education, residency, and the like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the beginning the military establishment rightly understood that the breakup of the all-black unit would in a closed society necessarily mean more than mere desegregation. It constantly used the terms integration and equal treatment and opportunity to describe its racial goals. Rarely, if ever, does one find the word desegregation in military files that include much correspondence.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Keith M. Woods writing on the need for precision in [[journalism|journalistic]] language writes, "''Integration'' happens when a monolith is changed, like when a black family moves into an all-white neighborhood. Integration happens even without a mandate from the law. ''Desegregation''," on the other hand, "was the legal remedy to segregation."&lt;ref&gt;Keith M. Woods,  [http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=60326 Disentangling Desegregation Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009204314/http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=60326 |date=2004-10-09 }}, Poynter Online, February 3, 2004. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Making almost the same point, Henry Organ, identifying himself as " a participant in the Civil Rights Movement on the ([[San Francisco Peninsula|San Francisco]]) Peninsula in the '60s... and ... an African American," wrote in 1997, " The term 'desegregation' is normally reserved to the legal/legislative domain, and it was the legalization of discrimination in public institutions based on race that many fought against in the 1960s. The term 'integration,' on the other hand, pertains to a social domain; it does and should refer to individuals of different background who opt to interact."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Organ, [http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/spectrum/1997_Aug_13.GUEST130.html The true definition of integration], ''Palo Alto Weekly'', August 13, 1997. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''By the Color of Our Skin'' (1999) [[Leonard Steinhorn]] and Barbara Diggs-Brown - who also make a similar distinction between ''desegregation'' and ''integration'' - write "... television has... give[n] white Americans the sensation of having meaningful, repeated contact with blacks without actually having it. We call this phenomenon virtual integration, and it is the primary reason why the integration illusion - the belief that we are moving toward a colorblind nation - has such a powerful influence on race relations in America today." Reviewing this book in the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', Michael W. Lynch sums up some of their conclusions as, "Blacks and whites live, learn, work, pray, play, and entertain separately." He cites Stephan and Abigail Themstrom's ''America in Black and White'' as making the case to the contrary, gives anecdotal evidence on both sides of the question, and writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem, as I see it, is that access to the public spheres, specifically the commercial sphere, often depends on being comfortable with the norms of white society. If a significant number of black children aren't comfortable with them, it isn't by choice: It's because they were isolated from those norms. It's one thing for members of the black elite and upper middle class to choose to retire to predominantly black neighborhoods after a lucrative day's work in white America. It's quite another for people to be unable to enter that commercial sphere because they spent their formative years in a community that didn't, or couldn't, prepare them for it. Writes &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Harvard University]] [[sociology|sociologist]] Orlando&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Patterson, "The greatest problem now facing African-Americans is their isolation from the tacit norms of the dominant culture, and this is true of all classes."&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Lynch [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_7_31/ai_57815517 By the Color of Our Skin: The Illusion of Integration and the Reality of Race] (book review), ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', December 1999. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distinction not universally accepted===
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Although widespread, this distinction between ''integration'' and ''desegregation'' is not universally accepted. For example, it is possible to find references to "court-ordered integration"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.comGFHJUKJMHVCNGHNJGJ6EYT5Y56 7Y65NU87 5XZS/search?q=%22court-ordered+integration%22&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off] Google search for "court-ordered integration".&lt;/ref&gt; from sources such as the ''[[Detroit News]]'',&lt;ref name="Detroit"&gt;Ron French, Brad Heath, and Christine MacDonald, [http://www.detnews.com/2004/specialreport/0405/16/a01-153972.htm Metro classrooms remain separate, often unequal], ''[[Detroit News]]'', May 16, 2002. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wallace/timeline/index_2.html Timeline of George Wallace's Life], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[Encarta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554032_4/Eisenhower.html Eisenhower] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514175216/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554032_4/Eisenhower.html |date=2006-05-14 }} (part 4), MSN [[Encarta]]. 0_0Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
These same sources also use the phrase "court-ordered desegregation", apparently with exactly the same meaning;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.pbs.org/beyondbrown/history/factsheet_history.html The Evolution of Brown v. Board of Education], part of ''Beyond Brown'', PBS. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_761594304/President_Kennedy_Expresses_Outrage_at_Alabama_Deaths.html President Kennedy Expresses Outrage at Alabama Deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926053701/http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_761594304/President_Kennedy_Expresses_Outrage_at_Alabama_Deaths.html |date=2004-09-26 }} (sidebar), MSN Encarta. (Premium content.) Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Detroit News'' uses both expressions interchangeably in the same article.&lt;ref name="Detroit"/&gt;

When the two terms are confused, it is almost always to use ''integration'' in the narrower, more legalistic sense of ''desegregation''; one rarely, if ever, sees ''desegregation'' used in the broader cultural sense.

'''''Rock Profile''''' is a British television comedy show written by and starring [[double act|comedy partnership]] [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], both later widely known for the [[sketch comedy|sketch show]] ''[[Little Britain]]''. ''Rock Profile'' first appeared on the channel [[UK Play]] in 1999, directed by [[Michael Cumming]], before moving to [[BBC Two]] in 2000.

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving [[Jamie Theakston]] questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.

== Broadcast history ==

The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In Christmas 2000, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled ''[[Rock the Blind]]''. The episode followed [[Gary Barlow]] (Lucas) and [[Ronan Keating]] (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. [[Ted Robbins]] appeared as [[Pete Waterman]], and [[Sara Cox]] as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years.

In October 2001, several sketches were comprised for the re-launch of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', entitled ''The All-New Top of the Pops''. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. Fans of the series were happy to see its brief return, however, people who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments. Complaints were also sparked regarding the sketch featuring Lucas as [[Elton John]], who was being interviewed about his appearance on ''TOTP'', in which he performed ''[[The Lion King]]'''s main theme, "[[Circle of Life]]". A member of the audience also verbally harassed Lucas during the sketch, which resulted in the entire feature being cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, meaning only the DVD release is the only existent source to the public to view these.

In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website [[Funny or Die]] for free viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/05/lucas_and_walliams_revive_rock_profiles.html|title=Lucas and Walliams revive Rock Profiles|work=broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host [[Dermot O'Leary]]. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with [[Katie Price|Jordan]] and [[Peter Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|title=Rock Profile:Peter Andre &amp; Jordan Pt.1|work=Funny or Die|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729033635/http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''Rock Profile'' has been well received by critics. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described the show as "truly silly and truly inspired". ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' described it as "excellent comedy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Rock Profile |publisher=BBC DVD |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called it "hilarious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/221770/Rock-Profile-on-DVD.html |title=''Rock Profile'' on DVD |last=Wood |first=Beci |date=July 26, 2005 |website=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD release ==

A DVD release of ''Rock Profile'' appeared in 2005, featuring both series, ''Rock the Blind'', the ''TOTP'' sketches, as well as a never-before seen commercial and sketches composed for ''The Ralf Little Show''.

[[Image:Smalltrade.JPG|thumbnail|right|400px|Early Scottish Trades Gravestone. Irvine.]]
The '''Scottish''' or '''Lowland Scottish gravestone''' is unique to the north of the [[British Isles]]. The study of [[Scottish Lowlands|Scottish Lowland]] [[Gravestones]] is essential to the overall study of British [[monumental inscription]]s. The level of symbolism and detail on Scottish stones reached a peak during the 18th century.

== Early tombs ==
The earliest [[tombs]] in Scotland are now lost. If [[Palaeolithic]] man ever set foot in that country, all traces have been wiped away. However, numerous [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] tombs, [[cairn]]s, [[chambered cairns]] and burial mounds have been discovered and studied. The [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s may have pioneered the concept of a modern [[graveyard]] for their remains have been found grouped together in much the same manner as today. In addition to using traditional burial methods, they would also create allotments for their dead. Iron Age burials are, however currently rare in Britain.

== Early church burials ==
[[Image:Ayr coffin.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Medieval Stone Coffin on open-air display in Ayrshire]]British archaeological evidence indicates that the custom of burying the dead in or around a church began as early as the 8th century. By the early 12th century, [[Saxons]], [[Normans]] and [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] knights were given lands throughout [[Scotland]]. The new lords built chapels and churches on their new estates. With so many servants, beneficiaries and eventually Tenants, the Church land was soon used to bury the dead of the surrounding village.

== Pre-Reformation ==
[[Image:16thcent.JPG|thumbnail|left|100px|Slab stone dated 1586. Dreghorn Old Kirkyard.]]Very few pre-[[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] stones exist today and those that do are often removed from their original position and given care and shelter in a local museum. Medieval stone [[coffins]], or sarcophagi, are more abundant. 

Since 1457, it had been the habit to organise the local ''[[Wappenshaw]]'' (presenting [[weapon]]ry for inspection) in the local graveyards. The resulting wounds on the fine sandstone of many rare stones has left them defaced by the continuous bombardment of missiles.

== Post-Reformation ==
The 16th century, the century in which Scotland played host to her own [[Protestant Reformation]], was a quiet one for Scottish gravestones. It seems that they were seldom produced and are indeed a rare sight today in our old graveyards. More stones were produced in the 17th and 18th centuries.

== 17th-century stones ==
[[Image:Trade tools.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Trade Tools depicted on a 17th-century lowland Paisley Gravestone]]By the early 17th century, many ancient graveyards had become swollen with so many bodies that their lands were recognisable as burial grounds. Some sites have been subjected to an increase of several feet in height. By the middle of the century, we begin to see more identification marks on the stones. [[Heraldic devices]], [[craft tools]], symbols of [[Death|mortality]] and the name, date of birth and often the address of the deceased began to be crammed onto the limited surfaces of the stone.

One side of the headstone was dedicated to written identification while the other was to be used for symbolic expression. The symbolic elements would usually reveal the man's occupation while reminding the living viewer that he or she too must depart this earth sooner or later.

== 18th-century stones ==
[[Image:Dreghorn 2.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|18th-century Lowland Gravestone.]]Perhaps the most ambitious period of Headstone carving. Indeed, it was this century that the traditional headstone came to be used as standard. One fact that marks the Lowland Scottish Headstone as unique is that the Headstone took almost a century to penetrate into the highlands, where the older slab and table grave markers were still being used until shortly before the 19th century. The height of 18th-century Scottish Lowland Gravestones can be anywhere between 60&amp;nbsp;cm and 100&amp;nbsp;cm. Also unique to the Scottish Lowland gravestone are the materials. Sandstone is an easily carved but easily weathered rock but it was used as the standard gravestone material in the north of Britain. In the south, where marbles and granite were the preferred medium, we see an understandable hesitation on the part of the stonemason to overly decorate the hard stones of England.

18th-century Scottish gravestones are almost always oriented east to west. The part which contains the identification of the cadaver usually faces towards the [[Holy Land]]. Since most 18th-century were left relatively unadorned, the rear side of stone was frequently left unmarked. This is the side that invariably faced away from the Holy Land, towards the west. However, in many lowland graveyards, the side usually left unmarked is covered with extravagant designs.

[[File:19th century scottish gravestone.JPG|thumbnail|right|250px|19th-century ornate stone]]
In the mid-18th century, tradesman, craftsmen and tenant farmers found themselves in a time of prosperity. A direct result of this was the increase in carefully inscribed gravestones for the common folk.

== 19th-century stones ==
The 19th century saw almost all memorial permutations of the past come back with gusto. Wall monuments, crypts, headstones, table and slab stones and even replica Hog Backs were all common designs in Victorian Scotland. The introduction of the Cast-Iron Grave Marker would simply add yet another embellishment to an already decorative art form.

'''Sign languages''' (also known as '''signed languages''') are [[language]]s that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Language is expressed via the manual signstream in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with "[[body language]]", a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].

Wherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as children of deaf adults ([[Child of deaf adult|CODAs]]).

It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 137 sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

''Sign Language Legislation in the European Union - Edition II''. European Union of the Deaf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, [[home sign]], "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.

== History ==
{{Main|History of sign language}}
[[Image:Arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos.jpg|thumb|Juan Pablo Bonet, {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} ("Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak") (Madrid, 1620)]]

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"&lt;ref name="bauman2008"&gt;{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=0-8166-4619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de León]] (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} (‘Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak’) in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar á ablar los Mudos''. Ed. Abarca de Angulo, Madrid, ejemplar facsímil accesible en la {{cite web |url=http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172251/http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}, online (spanish) scan of book, held at University of Sevilla, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics, setting out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet.

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644]]
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, John (1641). ''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of "secret discoursing, by signes and gestures".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: "Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z." (1641:116-117)&lt;/ref&gt; public speaking, or communication by deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;John Bulwer's "Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',&lt;ref&gt;Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;&lt;ref&gt;See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.&lt;/ref&gt; some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, G. "The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. "Historical Aspects of Manual Communication" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.&lt;br /&gt;
and Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe (1720). "The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

Frenchman [[Abbé de l'Épée|Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called [[Gallaudet University]], it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

{{Anchor| not speech based}} Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand all have English as their dominant language, but [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from [[French Sign Language]] whereas the other three countries sign dialects of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |title=Ethnologue report for language code: bfi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009095734/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Spanish Sign Language survey |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020141343/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in a Spanish-speaking country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Bolivia deaf community and sign language pre-survey report |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024309/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which don't necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucas, Ceil]], Robert Bayley and [[Clayton Valli]]. 2001.

[[International Sign]], formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and meetings of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]]. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a [[pidgin]], they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Linguistics ==
In linguistic terms, sign languages are as rich and complex as any spoken language, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages". Professional [[linguistics|linguists]] have studied many sign languages and found that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Klima|Klima, Edward S.]]; &amp; [[Ursula Bellugi|Bellugi, Ursula]]. (1979). ''The signs of language''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-80795-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sandler, Wendy; &amp; Lillo-Martin, Diane. (2006). Sign Language and Linguistic Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign languages are not [[mime]]—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not [[onomatopoeic]]. While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Taub (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s (from the Greek word for "hand") in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s (from Greek for "voice") of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].
&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317336147_Chereme_In_Hall_T_A_Pompino-Marschall_B_ed_Dictionaries_of_Linguistics_and_Communication_Science_Worterbucher_zur_Sprach-_und_Kommunikationswissenschaft_WSK_Volume_Phonetics_and_Phonology_Berlin_New_Y “Chereme”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231914/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317336147_Chereme_In_Hall_T_A_Pompino-Marschall_B_ed_Dictionaries_of_Linguistics_and_Communication_Science_Worterbucher_zur_Sprach-_und_Kommunikationswissenschaft_WSK_Volume_Phonetics_and_Phonology_Berlin_New_Y |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science. Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the [[Hockett's design features|characteristics]] that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, [[semanticity]], [[arbitrariness]], [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], and [[Traditional transmission|cultural transmission]].

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], a high degree of [[inflection]] by means of changes of movement, and a [[Topic-comment language|topic-comment]] [[syntax]]. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information".&lt;ref&gt;Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category "sign languages" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,&lt;ref&gt;p. 970-972. ''Linguistic Bibliography for the Year 1988''. Leiden, Netherlands:Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; when it appeared with 39 entries.

=== Relationships with spoken languages ===
[[Image:Holečkova, nápis ve znakové řeči.jpg|thumb| Sign language relief sculpture on a stone wall: "Life is beautiful, be happy and love each other", by Czech sculptor [[Zuzana Čížková]] on Holečkova Street in [[Prague]]-[[Smíchov]], by a school for the deaf]]

Always there is a common misconception that sign languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: that they are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlmutter|first=David M.|title=What is Sign Language?|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|work=LSA|accessdate=4 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412004710/http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities in [[Sign language in the brain|language processing in the brain]] between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.

On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|"Hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of "hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[American Sign Language grammar#Numeral incorporation and classifiers|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===
Sign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012688117|title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing|last=|first=|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=Quer, Josep, Carlo Cecchetto &amp; Caterina Donati et al. (eds.)|year=2017|isbn=9781501511806|location=|pages=|oclc=1012688117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross &amp; Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boudreault|first=Patrick|author2=Mayberry, Rachel I.|year=2006|title=Grammatical processing in American Sign Language: Age of first-language acquisition effects in relation to syntactic structure|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=21|issue=5|pages=608–635|doi=10.1080/01690960500139363}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.&lt;ref name="Baker&amp;Cokely"&gt;Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll"&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and Bencie Woll (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means 'carelessly', but a similar non-manual in BSL means 'boring' or 'unpleasant'.&lt;ref name=Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll /&gt;

Discourse functions such as [[conversation analysis|turn taking]] are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Charlotte (1977). Regulators and turn-taking in American Sign Language discourse, in Lynn Friedman, ''On the other hand: New perspectives on American Sign Language.'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconicity ===
The first studies on [[iconicity]] in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klima &amp; Bellugi (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. "The Signs of Language." Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane. "Introduction." Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.

Some researchers have suggested that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to document this benefit. In his study, Brown found that when children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than when they were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or "English on the hands." One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.

The [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"&gt;Taub (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation ("[[construal]]" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"&gt;Wilcox (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for "ask" has parts of its form that are iconic ("movement away from the mouth" means "something coming from the mouth"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"&gt;Meir (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as "double mapped".&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"/&gt;

Although sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.

A [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&amp;nbsp;– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the "gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1987). See also the classification of [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1991) for the general issue of jargons as prototypes in sign language genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao sign language 025.jpg|thumb|Young students learn some words of [[Lao sign language]] from Suliphone, a deaf artist. This was one of several activities at a school book party sponsored by Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in [[Laos]] where Suliphone works.]]
* [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Auslan]] and [[NZSL]] are usually considered to be a language known as [[BANZSL]]. [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[South African Sign Language]] are also related to BSL.&lt;ref&gt;See Gordon (2008), under nsr {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014547/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }} and sfs {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104537/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Sign Language]] and its descendants [[Norwegian Sign Language]] and [[Icelandic Sign Language]] are largely mutually intelligible with [[Swedish Sign Language]]. [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Portuguese Sign Language]] derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to [[British Sign Language]].
* [[Indian Sign Language]] ISL is similar to [[Pakistani Sign Language]]. (ISL fingerspelling uses both hands, similarly to British Sign Language.).
* [[Japanese Sign Language]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and [[Korean Sign Language]] are thought to be members of a [[Japanese Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Susan D. ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 499.|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Sign Language family]]. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].
* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.
* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.
* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a "cluster" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.
* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].
* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's classification went into [[Ethnologue]]'s database where it is still cited.{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072840/http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }} The subsequent edition of Ethnologue in 1992 went up to 81 sign languages, ultimately adopting Wittmann's distinction between primary and alternate sign languages (going back ultimately to Stokoe 1974) and, more vaguely, some other traits from his analysis. The 2013 version (17th edition) of [[Ethnologue]] is now up to 137 sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann adds that this taxonomic criterion is not really applicable with any scientific rigor: Auxiliary sign languages, to the extent that they are full-fledged natural languages (and therefore included in his survey) at all, are mostly used by the deaf as well, and some primary sign languages (such as ASL and [[Adamorobe Sign Language]]) have acquired auxiliary usages.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann includes in this class [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] (at least 14 different languages), [[Monastic sign language]], Thai Hill-Country sign languages (possibly including languages in Vietnam and Laos), and [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (14 deaf schools with different sign languages).&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language.&lt;ref name=pro-A&gt;These are [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Armenian Sign Language]], [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]], Hindu [[mudra]], the [[Monastic sign languages]], [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], [[Urubú-Kaapor Sign Language]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Japanese Sign Language]], and maybe the various [[Thai Hill-Country sign languages]], [[French Sign Language]], [[Lyons Sign Language]], and [[Mayan sign languages|Nohya Maya Sign Language]]. Wittmann also includes, bizarrely, Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;/ref&gt; Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called "[[stimulus diffusion]]".&lt;ref name=pro-R&gt;These are [[Providencia Island Sign Language|Providencia Island]], [[Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia]] (manually signed Malay), [[German Sign Language|German]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language|Ecuadoran]], [[Salvadoran Sign Language|Salvadoran]], [[Gestuno]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language|Indo-Pakistani]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Kenyan Sign Language|Kenyan]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian]], [[Spanish Sign Language|Spanish]], [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] (with possible admixture), [[Penang Sign Language|Penang]], [[Rennellese Sign Language|Rennellese]], [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi]], the various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]], and perhaps BSL, [[Peruvian Sign Language|Peruvian]], [[Tijuana Sign Language|Tijuana]] (spurious), [[Venezuelan Sign Language|Venezuelan]], and [[Nicaraguan Sign Language|Nicaraguan]] sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The families of [[BANZSL|BSL]], [[German Sign Language|DGS]], [[Japanese Sign Language|JSL]], [[French Sign Language|LSF]] (and possibly [[Lyons Sign Language|LSG]]) were the products of [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] of prototype languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's references on the subject, besides his own work on [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] in spoken languages, include papers such as Fischer (1974, 1978), Deuchar (1987) and Judy Kegl's pre-1991 work on creolization in sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's explanation for this is that models of acquisition and transmission for sign languages are not based on any typical parent-child relation model of direct transmission which is inducive to variation and change to a greater extent. He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typology ===
{{See also|Linguistic typology}}

Linguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

Brentari&lt;ref name="Brentari1998"&gt;Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35–36; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Zeshan, Cesar Ernesto Escobedo Delgado, Hasan Dikyuva, Sibaji Panda, and Connie de Vos. 2013. Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology. Linguistic Typology 17: 357–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
{{See also|Language acquisition}}

Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the plasticity of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=|website=ACFOS|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262–290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Written forms ===
{{anchor|Notation}}&lt;!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here --&gt;
Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jason | year = 2008 | title = Choosing how to write sign language: a sociolinguistic perspective | url = | journal = [[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]] | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 75–90 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* [[Stokoe notation]], devised by Dr. [[William Stokoe]] for his 1965 ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'',&lt;ref name="StokoeWilliam"&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].
* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.
* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language.  Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting "is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system."&lt;ref name="GaleaLinguistic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, [[American Sign Language|sign]] [[Categorical perception|perception]] influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development.  The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142013/http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = P | year = 1991 | title = Human adults and human infants show a 'perceptual magnet effect' for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 93–107 | doi=10.3758/bf03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morford | first1 = J.

The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.

=== Deaf communities and deaf culture ===
{{Main|Deaf culture}}

When Deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, Deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003"&gt;{{citation

|isbn = 0-195-14997-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These Deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the Deaf community is [[Black ASL]]. This sign language was developed in the Black Deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young Black Deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white Deaf peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaskill, C. (2011). The hidden treasure of Black ASL: its history and structure. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a "village sign language"&lt;ref name="ZeshanDeVos2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this happens in small, tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool. Famous examples include:
* [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[United States]]
* [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]], [[Israel]]
* [[Kata Kolok]], [[Bali]]
* [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Ghana]] 
* [[Mayan Sign Language#Yucatec Mayan Sign Language|Yucatec Maya Sign Language]], [[Mexico]] 
In such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, 
so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate "Deaf" community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003" /&gt;

Many [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the [[Warlpiri Sign Language|Warlpiri]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]], [[Dieri]], [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], and [[Warlmanpa language|Warlmanpa]], and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A [[pidgin]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=What is the evidence that it was a pidgin?}} sign language arose among tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Great Plains]] region of [[North America]] (see [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]). It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.
In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Signs may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.

=== Legal recognition ===
{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}
Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A deaf person using a remote VRS interpreter to communicate with a hearing person]]

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&amp;nbsp;– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"&gt;Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&amp;T Picturephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 &amp; 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969;&lt;/ref&gt; However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a [[video link]], either with a special-purpose [[videophone]] designed for use with sign language or with "off-the-shelf" [[videotelephony|video services]] designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer [[webcam]].  The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|special videophones]] that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

=== Interpretation ===
{{Main|Language interpretation#Sign language}}
[[File:2017 Woodstock 022 Język migowy.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Sign Language]] interpreter at the [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2017]]
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used.  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent [[deep learning]] based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Huang | first=Jie | last2=Zhou | first2=Wengang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Li | first4=Houqiang | last5=Li | first5=Weiping | title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation | website=arXiv.org e-Print archive | date=2018-01-30 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | archivedate=2018-03-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote interpreting ===

[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|175px|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

=== Interpretation on television ===
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]

Sign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.

[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | publisher= | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | pages= | accessdate=2008-01-30 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.&lt;ref name="RNID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed. Some emerging [[television]] technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to [[subtitles]] and [[closed captioning]].&lt;ref name="RNID"/&gt;

Legal requirements covering sign language on television vary from country to country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Broadcasting Act 1996]] addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |title=ITC Guidelines on Standards for Sign Language on Digital Terrestrial Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423180334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been replaced by the [[Communications Act 2003]].

=== Language endangerment ===
As with any spoken language, sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming [[Endangered languages|endangered]]. For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users [[Language shift|shift]] to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|title=Did you know Hawai'i Sign Language is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065744/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195139778|language=en|quote=The language is considered to be endangered. 9,600 deaf people in Hawaii now use American Sign Language with a few local signs for place-names and cultural items.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
{{Main|Manually coded language}}

When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== "Baby sign language" with hearing children ===
{{Main|Baby sign language}}

It has become popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL or some other sign language) to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a beneficial option for better communication.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.  This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants.  When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
{{Main|Home sign}}

Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes "home sign" or "kitchen sign").&lt;ref&gt;Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow &amp; Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.&lt;ref&gt;The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard. ({{cite web|title=Change Request Number: 2016-002|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|website=ISO 639-3|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2016-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128214659/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-28|df=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primate use===
{{Main|Great ape language#Primate use of sign language|l1=Great ape language § Primate use of sign language}}

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
{{Main|Origin of language#Gestural theory|l1=Origin of language § Gestural theory}}

One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes (1973), Premack &amp; Premack (1983), Kimura (1993), Newman (2002), Wittmann (1980, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Alley''''' ({{lang-fa|کتاب کوچه}} ''Ketâb-e Kucheh'') is a series of books about [[Persian language|Persian]] idioms and proverbs by [[Ahmad Shamlou]] coauthored with his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]].

==History==

[[Ahmad Shamlou|Shamlou]] devoted four decades of his life to collecting and organizing [[Iranian folklore]]. Folklore from his perspective is a body of traditional beliefs, customs, and expressions. The language in general, and oral languages in particular, address it through different uses such as proverbs, laments, cries and so on. Therefore the language could be used as an index to folklore as a body of tradition. The research work entitled ''Ketab Kuche ''(Translation: ''The Book of Alley'') indexes the Iranian folklore through the Persian language. The book is a multi-volume, multi-disciplinary work designed as a major source of information, providing a detailed and accurate picture of an important world civilization over a span of several thousand years. ''Ketab Kuche'' is one of the third Iranian national projects on Persian heritage and language beside the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], a multi-disciplinary reference work and research tool designed to record the facts of Iranian history and civilization and the [[Dehkhoda dictionary]], the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 15 volumes. 14 volumes of this book were printed during his lifetime.

After Shamlou's death, his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]] took responsibility for the book.

'''''The Colony''''' is a 2013 Canadian [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by Jeff Renfroe. It had a limited release on 26 April 2013 in [[Canada]], and was released on 20 September 2013 in the [[United States]].

==Plot==
By 2045, humans have built weather machines to control the warming climate due to [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. The machines break down when one day it begins to snow and doesn't stop. Whatever humans remain live in [[underground bunker]]s to escape the extreme cold. Their challenges are controlling disease and producing sufficient food. Two soldiers, Briggs ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) and Mason ([[Bill Paxton]]) are the leaders of one such bunker, Colony 7. Briggs, Sam ([[Kevin Zegers]]) and Graydon ([[Atticus Dean Mitchell]]) travel to nearby Colony 5 after receiving a distress signal. Briggs leaves Sam's lover Kai ([[Charlotte Sullivan]]) in charge of the colony while he's gone, much to Mason's chagrin.

Upon arrival, they find Colony 5 covered in blood. They eventually reach a locked door which Sam picks open. Inside they find Leland, who shows them a message they received from another group of people who fixed a weather machine and have caused the snow to thaw. The group offers aid to anyone and asks that they bring seeds so they can be planted in the newly thawed permafrost soil. Leland shows them where the signal came from, but informs them that an expedition failed to find the source of the transmission. Moreover, the expedition's tracks led a marauding group of [[Cannibalism|cannibals]] back to Colony 5, and the killing ensued. Briggs, Sam, and Graydon try to force Leland to return with them, but he locks himself back into his room.

The three then begin to explore Colony 5 and approach a room where a fire burns.  Here they see a human chopping up members of Colony 5, while others feast on human remains. As the three try to escape, Graydon is killed by the cannibals. Briggs and Sam are able to make it up the ladder out of the colony and destroy the shaft with a stick of dynamite. Taking shelter in an abandoned helicopter, they wake up in the morning to find that the cannibals have managed to escape from the entombed Colony 5 and have tracked their footprints in the snow. Briggs suggests that they lure the group over a decrepit bridge then use dynamite. When the dynamite fuse goes out, Briggs rushes back to light it, but is attacked by the cannibals. He relights the fuse and sacrifices himself to blow a large gap in the bridge.

Kai gets into a heated argument with Mason after learning that he intends to kill a colonist without testing her (for disease). Their argument is interrupted when Kai spots a returning, exhausted Sam and runs to him, but Mason promptly knocks her out. When Sam awakens, he finds Mason has taken over and plans to make harsh changes. Sam explains that the cannibals are coming and that there is a thawed-out area they should flee to. Mason does not believe him, thinking he has become unhinged by his ordeal, and handcuffs him to a bed. Sam is able to get free and checks images from a functioning [[satellite]] to locate the thawed-out zone. Then the cannibals arrive. Many of the Colony 7 inhabitants are killed, including Sam's friend Viktor (John Tench). The survivors lock themselves in a room. Sam and Kai bang on the door, but Mason will not let them in. Briggs' daughter Nara (Lisa Berry) knocks Mason down and lets them in. Sam opens a vent for an escape route. The wounded Mason stays behind and, when the cannibals break in, shoots a gas container, causing an explosion that kills all but the leader. The cannibals' leader attacks Sam, but Sam is able to kill him. Then he, Kai, Nara and a few others begin their journey to the thawed-out site with the precious seeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">'''The Unbroadcastable Radio Show''' was a monthly live comedy show performed at the [[Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]], [[Manchester]]. The show took the format of the recording of a radio show, featuring topical comedy written up to (and occasionally during) the day of performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2004/10/27/unbroadcastable_radio_show_comedy_review_feature.shtml BBC - Manchester - Entertainment - The very best of the Unbroadcastable Radio Show - review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thespis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɛ|s|p|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Θέσπις}}; fl. 6th century BC) of Icaria (present-day [[Dionysos, Greece]]), according to certain [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] sources and especially [[Aristotle]], was the first person ever to appear on stage as an [[actor]] playing a character in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] (instead of speaking as him or herself).  In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Buckham, Philip Wentworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IjAZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Theatre+of+the+Greeks ''Theatre of the Greeks''], Cambridge : J. Smith, 1827.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thespis was a singer of [[dithyramb]]s (songs about stories from mythology with choric [[refrain]]s). He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories, distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks.

This new style was called [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]], and Thespis was the most popular exponent of it. Eventually, in 534 BC competitions to find the best tragedy were instituted at the [[City Dionysia]] in [[Athens]], and Thespis won the first documented competition.  Capitalising on his success, Thespis also invented theatrical touring;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' 275-7&lt;/ref&gt; he would tour various cities while carrying his costumes, masks and other props in a horse-drawn wagon.

==Alleged works==
Titles of some plays have been attributed to Thespis. But most modern scholars, following the suggestion of [[Diogenes Laërtius]], consider them to be forgeries, some forged by the philosopher [[Heraclides Ponticus]], others by or altered by Christian writers:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, Book V, Heraclides, 92:"And Aristoxenus the musician says, that he composed tragedies, and inscribed them with the name of Thespis."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann August Nauck|A Nauck]],''Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'' (1887), page 832: "Thespidis quaecumque feruntur ab impostoribus esse ficta vix est quod moneam, et proditur hoc fraudis genere usus esse Heraclides Ponticus......Heraclidis igitur crediderim esse fr.1-3; nam fr.4 non dubito quin alteri post Christum saeculo debeatur."&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Hiereis'' (''Priests'')
*''Hemitheoi'' (''Demigods'')
*''Pentheus''

Fragments (probably spurious) in [[Johann August Nauck|A Nauck]], ''Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'' (1887).&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann August Nauck|A Nauck]],''Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'' (1887), page 832-833.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is implied that Thespis invented [[acting]] in the [[Western world]], and that prior to his performances, no one had ever assumed the resemblance of another person for the purpose of storytelling. In fact, Thespis is the first known actor in ''written'' plays. He may thus have had a substantial role in changing the way stories were told and inventing [[theatre]] as we know it today. In reverence to Thespis, actors in the English-speaking part of the world have been referred to as ''thespians''.

Thespis was the title character in an [[Thespis (opera)|1871 comic opera]] by [[W. S. Gilbert|W.S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], the first collaboration between the two men, although the musical score has mostly been lost. The story involves Thespis and his troupe of actors temporarily replacing the [[Twelve Olympians|Gods of Olympus]], while the latter come down to earth to "mingle" with humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gsarchive.net/thespis/libretto.txt|title=Libretto: "Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old"|last=|first=|date=|website=The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch of the [[National Theatre of Greece]] expressly instituted in 1939 to tour the country is named "The Wagon of Thespis" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Άρμα Θέσπιδος, ''Árma Théspidos'') in his honour.

A first season episode of the TV series ''[[Sports Night#Season 1: 1998–1999|Sports Night]]'' was named "Thespis" and referenced him.

}}'''''This Horrid Practice: The Myth and Reality of Traditional Maori Cannibalism''''' is a 2008 non-fiction book by New Zealand historian [[Paul Moon]]. The book is a comprehensive survey of the history of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand. It was the first published academic survey of Māori cannibalism.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10521165"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&amp;objectid=10521165 |title=Cannibalism had little to do with consuming enemies' mana, says historian |author=Tahana, Yvonne |date=12 July 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book is drawn from the 16 January 1770 journal entry of [[Captain James Cook]], who, in describing acts of Māori cannibalism, stated "though stronger evidence of this horrid practice prevailing among the inhabitants of this coast will scarcely be required, we have still stronger to give."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Byron]], [[Samuel Wallis]], [[Philip Carteret]], [[James Cook]], [[Joseph Banks]] (1785, 3d ed.). ''An account of the voyages undertaken by the order of His present Majesty for making discoveries in the southern hemisphere'', vol. 3 (London) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post publication ==
Shortly after the book appeared, it was featured in numerous news reports and on the New Zealand television programme [[60 Minutes (New Zealand)|''60 Minutes'']]. The publication of ''This Horrid Practice'' was controversial because of the book's determination that cannibalism was widespread among New Zealand Māori until the mid-19th century. Māori cannibalism is a sensitive topic in New Zealand, and Moon anticipated that the book would be negatively received by some.&lt;ref name = eastbays/&gt;

The book prompted an anonymous but formal complaint to the [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission]], arguing that it "describes the whole of Maori society as violent and dangerous. This is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10529179"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10529179 |title=Racism claim over cannibal book |author=Tahana, Yvonne |date=27 August 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Moon's critics, [[Margaret Mutu]], acknowledged that cannibalism was widespread throughout New Zealand but argued that Moon, as a [[Pākehā]], "did not understand the history of cannibalism and it was 'very, very hard for a Pakeha to get it right on these things'".&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_565552"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/archived-stuff-sections/archived-national-sections/korero/565552 |title=Tales of Maori cannibalism told in new book |date=5 August 2008 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon responded by stating that Mutu had "condemned me and announced to the media that I did not understand the history of cannibalism, although she admitted to not having read even a single sentence of the book."&lt;ref name = Moon/&gt; Moon also charged his critics with attempted censorship and name-calling.&lt;ref name=Moon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&amp;objectid=10529547 |title=Censorship alive and well and living in NZ |author=Moon, Paul |authorlink=Paul Moon |date=29 August 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one news report, Moon commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What amazes me is that the critics who say I don’t understand the mechanisations of this practice often have not even read the book. Nor do they have evidence to the contrary. While they may not like its content, they can’t deny historical fact. And trying to censor this book is denying the past.&lt;ref name=eastbays&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/east-bays-courier/601301 |title=Author unbowed on book's horrid reaction |date=28 August 2008 |work=[[East &amp; Bays Courier]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="822">A '''window cornice''' is an ornamental framework of wood or composition to which window curtains are attached by rods with [[rings or hooks]]. Cornices are often gilded and of elaborate design, but they are less fashionable today than before it had been discovered that elaborate draperies harbor dust and microbes.

Like other pieces of furniture, they have reflected taste as it passed, and many of the carefully constructed examples of the latter part of the 18th century are still in use in the rooms for which they were made. [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] provided a famous series still ''in situ'' for the gallery at [[Harewood House]], the valances of which are, like the cornices themselves, of carved and painted wood.
