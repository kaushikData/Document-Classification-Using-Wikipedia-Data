'''ACD/ChemSketch''' is a [[molecular modeling]] program used to create and modify images of [[chemical structure]]s. Also, there is a [[software]] that allows molecules and molecular models displayed in two and three dimensions, to understand the structure of chemical bonds and the nature of the [[functional groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemsketch|url=http://escritoriodocentes.educ.ar/datos/cie_acd_chemsketch_free.html|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
The program offers some advanced features that allows the [[molecule]]s rotate and apply color to improve visualization. It has several templates with ions and functional groups with the possibility to add text and use other tools to optimize productions created by the software.&lt;ref name="Eduteka Chemsketch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Utilizando Chemsketch|url=http://www.eduteka.org/ChemSketch.php|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Using ACD/ChemSketch is primarily for educational use. With this program it is possible to write and perform [[chemical equations]], diagrams laboratories and [[chemical structure]]s of various entity.&lt;ref name="Eduteka Chemsketch"/&gt;

'''Academic standards''' are the [[Benchmarking|benchmarks of quality and excellence]] in [[education]] such as the rigour of [[curriculum|curricula]] and the difficulty of [[Test (assessment)|examinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGopGkTxmLkC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Really raising standards |author=Philip Adey, Michael Shayer }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of universal academic standards requires agreement on rubrics, criteria or other systems of coding academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadler|first=D. Royce|date=2014|title=The futility of attempting to codify academic achievement standards|url=|journal=Higher Education: The International Journal of Higher Education and Educational Planning|volume=67|pages=273–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; At colleges and universities, faculty are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students [[Grade inflation|good marks and grades]] without regard for those students' actual abilities, both to keep those students in school paying tuition and to boost the schools' graduation rates. Students often use [[course evaluation]]s to criticize any instructor who they feel has been making the course too difficult, even if an objective evaluation would show that the course has been too easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Alderman| first =Geoffrey| title =Why university standards have fallen| newspaper =Guardian| date =10 March 2010| url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/universities-standards-blair-target| accessdate = 30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Brandon| first =Craig| title =The Five-Year Party: How Colleges Have Given Up on Educating Your Child and What You Can Do About It| publisher =BenBella Books| date =2010| pages =236| isbn =978-1935251804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Paton| first =Graeme| title =Education standards 'in decline' at overcrowded universities| newspaper =Telegraph| date =23 October 2014| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11182639/Education-standards-in-decline-at-overcrowded-universities.html| accessdate = 30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very difficult to find a direct correlation between the quality of the course and the outcome of the course evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/students-dont-always-recognize-good-teaching-study-finds/118274|title=The Chronicle of Higher Education|last=Berrett|first=Dan|date=May 9, 2017|website=chronicle.com |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Student evaluations are a controversial method of assessing academic achievement. Recent studies have correlated high student evaluation of instructors with high grades rather than mastery of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/students-dont-always-recognize-good-teaching-study-finds/118274|title=Students Don’t Always Recognize Good Teaching, Study Finds – The Ticker - Blogs - The Chronicle of Higher Education|website=www.chronicle.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also noted that students' understanding of assessment criteria can lead to enhanced learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://srhe.tandfonline.com/|title=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|last=Sadler|first=|date=|website=srhe.tandfonline.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization and academic standards ==
According to a 2009 report by [[UNESCO]], changes in the university structure in the late 20th and early 21st century have led to increasing access to or "massification" of higher education which has, in turn, resulted in both a diversification of the student population but also a general decrease in academic standards globally.&lt;ref&gt;Altbach, Phillip G., Liz Reisberg, and Laura E. Rumbley, "Trends in Global Higher Education: Tracking an Academic Revolution. A Report Prepared for the UNESCO 2009 World Conference on Higher Education" (France, UNESCO, 2009). http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30910755/Altbach__Reisberg__Rumbley_Tracking_an_Academic_Revolution__UNESCO_2009.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1494895733&amp;Signature=8P%2F9h78kTqQbTaKmy9VKiHaIwoc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTrends_in_global_higher_education_Tracki.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK==
In the UK, degree awarding bodies themselves are responsible for standards in [[higher education]], but these are checked during inspection by the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA) and the [[Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual).  On its website QAA defines academic standards as 'The standards set and maintained by institutions for their courses (programmes and modules) and expected for their awards.'&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last =QAA Glossary |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/AboutUs/glossary/Pages/glossary-a.aspx#a3 |title=Academic standards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dearing Report]] recommended in 1997 that benchmarking be used to measure and improve academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r350566m3xqh553p/ |title=Benchmarking Academic Standards in the UK |author=Mantz Yorke |journal=Tertiary Education and Management |volume=5 |number=1 |pages=79–94 |doi=10.1023/A:1018753222965}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2011 this was done by code of practice and other guidelines known as the ''Academic Infrastructure''.  During 2012-13, this was replaced by the ''Quality Code for Higher Education'', which included points about the availability of information about the learning experience to emphasize the role of the student as a paying customer of the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=227–228 |title=Reshaping the University |author=David Palfreyman, Ted Tapper |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0199659821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USA==
In the USA, regulation is at state level by bodies such as the Standards and Assessment Division of the [[Arizona Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azed.gov/|title=The Official Website of the Arizona Department of Education {{!}}|website=www.azed.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of academic standards ==
{{primary section|date=October 2017}}
The [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] is a group of academic standards which focus on two main subjects: mathematics and English language arts (ELA). These standards are intended to ensure mastery of information and prepare students for entry into the next grade and beyond. The core originated as a way to standardize the way students were taught from state-to-state, and also to quality of information students received. The Common Core has now been adopted by 42 states in the US.

The Common Core standards are:
* Research- and evidence-based
* Clear, understandable, and consistent
* Aligned with college and career expectations
* Based on rigorous and application of knowledge through higher order thinking skills
* Built upon the strengths and lessons of current state standards
* Informed by other top performing countries in order to prepare all students for success in our global economy and society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/|title=About the Standards {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guayas''''' is a [[sail training]] ship of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]. Launched in 1976, it was named in jointly in honor of [[Guayas (chief)|Chief Guayas]], the [[Guayas river]], and ''Guayas'', the first steamship that was constructed in South America in 1841, and is displayed on the [[Coat of arms of Ecuador|Ecuadorian coat of arms]].&lt;ref name=chapman/&gt; The ship's home base is [[Guayaquil]], [[Ecuador]].

== Description ==
''Guayas'' is a three-masted [[barque]] with a steel hull that can display a sailing area of {{convert|1410|sqm}}.&lt;ref name=chapman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QgMRudqoLGQC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=guayas+sail+ship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9RzEPVAQ4g&amp;sig=czR816LJbiOx__i1gqSmHvsiz94&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v7DLSeLlFI_nnQefq43MCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result Chapman Great Sailing Ships of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; The main mast reaches {{convert|38|m|ftin}} over deck. The ship carries a crew of about 120 sailors as well as eighty cadets under the leadership of about 35 officers. ''Guayas'' is one of four sailing ships that were built by Astilleros Celaya S.A. in [[Bilbao]], ''[[ARC Gloria|Gloria]]'' (Colombia) being the most similar ship;&lt;ref name=chapman/&gt; the other two [[sister ship]]s are ''[[Simón Bolívar (barque)|Simón Bolívar]]'' (Venezuela), and ''[[ARM Cuauhtémoc (BE01)|Cuauhtémoc]]'' (Mexico).

== History ==
[[File:BAE Guayas in Sydney 2016-01-10.jpg|thumb|300px|left|BAE "Guayas", Sydney, January 2016.]]

As an ambassador of its country, the ''Guayas'' is a participant in [[tall ship]] [[regatta]]s.

In 2010 she participated in [[Velas Sudamerica 2010]], an historical [[Latin America]]n tour by eleven tall ships to celebrate the [[Bicentennial of Argentina|bicentennial of the first national governments of Argentina]] and [[Bicentennial of Chile|Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velasudamerica2010.com//|title=Velas Sudamerica 2010|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Guayas" has also participated in [[Operation Sail|OpSail 2012]], visiting New York, Norfolk, Baltimore, and Boston, before proceeding to Europe.

The most recent participation was in the ''Tall Ships' Race 2012''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallshipsraces.com/Vessels/Race_Entry_List.asp Listings of Tall Ships' Races]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the ''Guayas'' undertook a voyage along the West coast of North America with port of calls at Acapulco, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=

On 8 January 2016, ''Guayas'' arrived in Sydney as part of a round-the-world training cruise, the longest (35,000 nautical miles) such cruise performed so far by this ship, during which 22 countries will be visited. This is the first visit to Australia since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flew |first=Janine |date=8 January 2016 |title= Ecuadorian navy training tall ship Guayas arrives at the museum |trans-title= |url= https://anmm.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/ecuadorian-navy-training-tall-ship-guayas-arrives-at-the-museum/ |language= |journal= |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |location=Sydney, Australia |access-date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17188">The California '''Master Plan for Higher Education''' of 1960 was developed by a survey team appointed by the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Regents]] and the State Board of Education during the administration of [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Pat Brown]]. [[Clark Kerr]], then the President of UC, was a key figure in its development. The Plan set up a coherent system for postsecondary education which defined specific roles for the already-existing [[University of California]] (UC), the [[California State University|California State ''College'']] (CSC) system of senior colleges, now California State ''University'' (CSU), and the [[California Community Colleges system]] (CCC).

The Master Plan also proposed a statutory framework for its implementation, which was signed into [[California law|law]] by Governor Brown on April 27, 1960.  The statute actually implementing the Master Plan is formally titled the '''Donahoe Higher Education Act'''&lt;ref&gt;California Education Code Section 66000 states that "[t]his part shall be known and may be cited as the Donahoe
Higher Education Act."&lt;/ref&gt; (now located at Part 40 of Division 3 of Title 3 of the California Education Code), to honor the memory of Assemblywoman Dorothy Donahoe of Bakersfield. Donahoe had authored the legislative resolution which eventually resulted in the study that created the Master Plan, and was one of its foremost advocates. However, she died on April 4, 1960, and did not live to see the Plan's recommendations signed into law.

==History==
Prior to the Master Plan's development in the 1960s, California struggled to reform its social institutions. Under political stranglehold, due to the 1920s-era [[railroad monopoly]], new, self-proclaimed reformers attempted to overthrow the economic and political corruption existing in the state at the time. They wanted to create new institutions with a public morality to give California a new form of purpose.&lt;ref&gt;John Douglass, "The California Idea and American Higher Education" (Stanford, VA: Stanford University Press, 2000), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the early years of California's emergence the population remained largely mobile, moving from opportunity to opportunity, making it almost impossible for the state to create permanent public schools. Furthermore, California progressives encountered obstacles in the form of people who thought that education should remain the work of local and religious groups, as well as being opposed to paying taxes for social purposes. Another wall towards progress that they needed to circumvent was the issue of appropriating land and money for universities. The 1st and 2nd Organic Acts (of 1866 and 1868, respectively) helped by first introducing the possibility of a state secular institution and second, actually allowing for the creation of a state university controlled by a Board of Regents (which would become the University of California).&lt;ref&gt;John Douglass, "The California Idea and American Higher Education" (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the state's legislators and academic administrators foresaw an approaching surge in University enrollment, due to the [[baby boom]] children coming of age. They needed a plan to be able to maintain educational quality in the face of growing demand.&lt;ref&gt;California State Department of Education (1960). [http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mastplan/MasterPlan1960.pdf A Master Plan for Higher Education in California: 1960-1975]. Chapter IV - Students: The Problem of Numbers, p. 46. Retrieved: 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying principles that they sought were:
* That some form of higher education ought to be available to all regardless of their economic means, and that academic progress should be limited only by individual proficiency; and
* differentiation of function so that each of the three systems would strive for excellence in different areas, so as to not waste public resources on duplicate efforts.&lt;ref name=UCOP&gt;University of California (2009). [http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/ca_masterplan_summary.pdf California Master Plan for Higher Education - Major Features] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228061941/http://ucfuture.universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/ca_masterplan_summary.pdf# |date=2013-12-28 }}. Office of the President. Retrieved: 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Master Plan was approved by the Regents and the State Board of Education and submitted to the Legislature in February 1960. In April of that year, the California Legislature passed the ''Donahoe Act'' placing into statute a number of components of the Master Plan.&lt;ref name = UCOP/&gt; However, California's Master Plan is more than a single statute. The 1960 Master Plan is embodied in several documents:
# A study completed by the Master Plan Survey Team approved by the State Board of Education and the University of California Board of Regents
# The ''Donahoe Act'' giving legal force to several key components of the plan
# A constitutional amendment which established the California State Colleges Board of Trustees (renamed the California State University in 1974).&lt;ref&gt;UC Berkeley (2010).

Center for Studies in Higher Education. Retrieved: 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Clark Kerr stated that the goal of the master plan was to balance the "competing demands of fostering excellence and guaranteeing educational access for all."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Jeffrey E. (July 14, 2011. [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/UC-where-are-your-native-sons-and-daughters-2354592.php "UC, where are your native sons and daughters?"] Hearst Communications - SF Gate. Retrieved: 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Master Plan achieved the following:
* It created a system that combined exceptional quality with broad access for students.
* It transformed a collection of uncoordinated and competing colleges and universities into a coherent system.
* It established a broad framework for higher education that encourages each of the three public higher education segments to concentrate on creating its own kind of excellence within its own particular set of responsibilities.
* And it acknowledged the vital role of the independent colleges and universities, envisioning higher education in California as a single continuum of educational opportunity, from small private colleges to large public universities.&lt;ref name = UCOP/&gt;

According to the Plan, the top one-eighth (12.5%) of graduating high school seniors would be guaranteed a place at a campus of the University of California ([[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[UCLA|Los Angeles]], etc.) tuition-free. The top one-third (33.3%) would be able to enter the California State University system ([[San Francisco State]], [[California State University, Los Angeles]], etc.). Community colleges (Bakersfield College, College of the Canyons, [[Citrus College]], [[Mount San Antonio College]], etc.) would accept any students "capable of benefiting from instruction."&lt;ref name = UCOP/&gt;  These percentages are now enforced by sliding scales equating [[grade point average]] and scores on the [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]] or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], which are recalculated every year. No actual ranking of students in high schools is used as many schools do not rank students.

Graduates of the community colleges would then be guaranteed transfer to the Cal State or UC systems in order to complete bachelor's degrees. This practice was carried over from previous years before the Plan was enacted, with graduates from the CCC being accepted as third-year students at the Universities by virtue of their prior coursework. Finally, the Plan established that the University of California would be the sole portion of the system charged with performing academic research, and would award master's and doctoral degrees in support of that mission. The Cal State system, in addition to awarding master's degrees, would be able to award joint doctorates with the UC.&lt;ref name = UCOP/&gt;

The "California Idea" - California's tripartite system of public research universities, comprehensive 4-year undergraduate campuses, and open-access community colleges – has been highly influential, and many other states and even nations have imitated this structure. California higher education has had a poor record of college completion and 4-year Baccalaureate degree attainment. Subgroups such as Latinos and African Americans, who are a large and growing demographic, show even worsening statistics of degree attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Richard; Geiser, Saul. "Beyond the Master Plan: The Case for Restructuring Baccalaureate Education in California." Center for Studies in Higher Education, 2012 p. 2. http://cshe.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/publications/docs/Geiser_S-Beyond_the_Master_Plan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
{{original research|section|date=September 2011}}

The Master Plan meant that essentially, "anyone from anywhere in California could, if they worked hard enough, get a bachelor’s degree from one of the best universities in the country (and, therefore, in the world), almost free of charge."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Bady and Mike Konczal, "From Master Plan to No Plan: The Slow Death of Public Higher Education," ''Dissent'', Fall 2012, http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/from-master-plan-to-no-plan-the-slow-death-of-public-higher-education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plan increased overall efficiency in the higher education system, as well as produced greater number of graduates at a lower per-student cost by removing redundancies. This was accomplished by clearly specifying the missions of each system segment, in addition to clarifying what "territory" belonged to each institution. It established a "rational" planning process for the growth of the university systems, setting aside a past practice in which the Legislature would introduce bills establishing new four-year universities in a member's home district, a kind of [[Pork barrel|political pork]].

The Plan was the basis for a substantial surge in development in California higher education. Today, many{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} credit the California universities for the place the state holds in the world economy, as well as bolstering its own economic makeup with great investment in high technology areas, such as [[Silicon Valley]], [[biotechnology]], and [[pharmaceuticals]].

The Plan has contributed to the massive economic contributions that the UC, CSU, and CCC systems have had to the state and its growth. According to a study by the Regents of California, the UC system is directly responsible for adding about $32.8 billion to the gross state product, which is about 1.8 percent of the total GSP, a key indicator of economic performance &lt;ref&gt;"The University of California's Economic Contribution to the State of California."Regents.universityofcalifornia.edu. Economic and Planning Systems Inc., 12 Sept. 2011. Web. 1 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/sept11/f7attach.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent changes==
In 1972, a review of the Plan found that the basic structure was good, but that it should be changed slightly to accommodate the ideas of the time. For example, the review board suggested that weekend and evening programs be expanded to serve “non-traditional” students, and incorporating technology such as T.V.&lt;ref&gt;Boilard, Steve. "The Master Plan at 50: Assessing California’s Vision for Higher Education."Lao.ca.gov.Legislative Analyst's Office, 12 Nov. 2009. Web. 01 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://www.lao.ca.gov/2009/edu/master_plan_intro/master_plan_intro_111209.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]], the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, was enacted, causing the free public education to be eliminated. (Since tuition was still banned under the act, the word was replaced with per-unit enrollment fees.) Though the costs were low, many taxpayers were very angered by it, though this might have been because of the direct effects of the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation.

The 1987 revision specifically recognized the contributions of the independent sector and made explicit provision to include the independent sector in the planning functions of the state's higher education system. It also established a policy to set the maximum award for Cal Grants in state law.

In 2005, the demand for high school and community college administrators brought about a widely debated exception to the existing differentiation of function between the CSU and UC systems. The awarding of doctoral degrees had originally been exclusive to the UC system, with the provision that the California State Universities could offer PhD degrees as "joint" degrees in combination with the University of California or an accredited private university. Under the provisions of SB&amp;nbsp;724, signed into law September 22, 2005, the campuses of the California State University were then able to directly offer a [[Doctor of Education]] degree (Ed.D) "focused on preparing administrative leaders". It was argued that this fulfilled the original purpose of many of the CSUs, which were set up as [[normal schools]] to train teachers.

In 2010, the CSU was also given the authority to exclusively offer two more [[Doctoral]] degrees - [[Doctorate in Nursing]] (DNP) and [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] (DPT).

When the Master Plan was first founded in 1960, post-secondary education enrollments were equally divided among 2-year and 4-year institutions. However, in 2010, due to a lack of funding, the framers of the Master Plan limited eligibility admission to UC and CSU. The cost-cutting move diverted a large number of students to 2-year institutions, which would still allow them to finish their lower division work and then transfer to a 4-year institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5866">The '''Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge''' (COMC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge official web site|url=https://cms.math.ca/COMC/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual [[mathematics competition]] held in [[Canada]] during the month of November. This competition is run by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]]. Students who score exceptionally well on this competition are selected to participate in the [[Canadian Mathematical Olympiad]].  

==Participation==
The COMC is written on a select day in November each year and is proctored by teachers across Canada. In order to participate in this competition, students must register through their school’s mathematics department and pay any fees associated with the competition. Following the day of the competition, exams are returned to a network of university partners across Canada for marking.
==Eligibility==
The competition is open to any student with an interest in mathematics.  However, to be official participants, students must satisfy the following criteria: 
:*must be in full-time attendance at an elementary or secondary school, or CEGEP since September of the year of the COMC;
:*be less than 19 years old as of June 30 of the year of the COMC; and 
:*must not have written the [[Putnam Competition]].

Students writing from outside Canada are not eligible for cash awards but compete for ranking in the International division.

Students not meeting the qualification requirements can still participate and marks as “unofficial” competitors.

==Format==
The COMC consists of three sections:
:*4 basic questions (Part A) for 4 marks each,
:*4 intermediary questions (Part B) for 6 marks each, and
:*4 advanced questions (Part C) for 10 marks each
for a total of 80 marks.

The length of the contest is 2.5 hours. Calculators are not permitted.

==Awards and Prizes==
There are two divisions: Canadian Awards, which is only for participants writing the exam from within Canada; and International Awards, which is only for participants writing it outside of Canada.

'''Canadian Award Categories'''

There are award categories for Best in Canada and Best in Province and Best in Region for all students as well as for students at each grade. For example:

:* Best in Canada Overall: all official participants (regardless of grade) in Canada compete for this, the most prestigious category,
:* Best in Canada, Grade XI: all Grade XI students in Canada compete for this,
:* Best in BC (overall): all official participants (regardless of grade) in BC,
:* Best in BC, Grade XII: all Grade XII students in BC,
:* Best in Toronto (overall): all official participants in Toronto-area schools,
:* Best in Toronto, Grade XII: All grade XII and Cégep students in Toronto compete for this category
:* etc.
The top six unique scores in any category earn awards: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Honourable Mention.

The top students in Canada also normally receive cash awards based on their ranking.

'''International Awards'''

The top official participants from outside Canada are considered for the international awards division, which is not grade-dependent. The top three unique scores are given Gold, Silver or Bronze. Additionally, any international student who achieves at least a score as high as the lowest Best in Canada Overall Honourable Mention will receive an Honourable Mention award in the International division.

'''Invitational Competitions and Math Team Canada'''

The top students who are Canadian Citizens or Permanent Residents (independent of grade or where they live or attend school) will be invited to participate in the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad (CMO) competition. Students who perform well on the CMO are selected for Math Team Canada, which represents Canada at the International Math Olympiad (IMO) the following summer.

Approximately the top 50 COMC students are invited to write the CMO. The next approximately 75 COMC students are invited to write the CMO Qualifying Repêchage. Approximately the top 10-15 students from the Repêchage will also be invited to write the CMO.

'''Scholarships'''

Competition results will be shared with Canadian partner universities to help them consider offering academic scholarships to high-potential students.

'''Camps'''

Approximately 24 Canadian students in grade 8, 9 or 10 with strong performance on the COMC will be invited to the summer CMS Canada Math Camp (CMC) hosted by the University of Toronto.

Canadian students who demonstrate solid performance at their grade level in their region or province may be invited to a summer regional CMS Math Camp staged in collaboration with a CMS university partner in their province.

'''Participation Certificates (Quartiles) and Prizes'''

When the final results are announced, teachers/organizers will be able to log into their accounts to download and print the Award or Participation certificates for all their students.

Certificate titles are based on the quartile into which the student's score falls:

:* 1st quartile = Performance with Distinction
:* 2nd quartile = Performance with Honours
:* 3rd or 4th quartile = Certificate of Participation

== Random Prize Draw ==

A number of prizes are given to randomly-drawn participants writing the COMC in Canada.  The chance of winning a prize depends on the respective number of national, provincial, or regional participants.

Teachers who participate in the COMC are also eligible for their own random prize draw.

[[File:Bialystok Technical University - Faculty of Electrical Engineering.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Bialystok Technical University, [[Poland]].]]

Both electrical and electronics engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical/ electronics engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending upon the university.

==Scope of undergraduate education==
The degree generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[project management]] and [[list of electrical engineering topics|specific topics in electrical and electronics engineering]]. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub fields of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub fields towards the end of the degree.
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States and Canada), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).

==Post graduate studies==
Electrical engineers can also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Engineering or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The Master and Engineer's degree may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The [[Doctor of Philosophy]] consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and various other European countries, the [[Master of Engineering]] is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the [[Bachelor of Engineering]].

==Typical electrical/electronics engineering undergraduate syllabus==
Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to ''electronics'' engineering course. ''Electrical'' engineering courses have other specializations such as [[electrical machines|machines]], [[power generation]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]. Note that the following list does not include the large quantity of mathematics (maybe apart from the final year) included in each year's study.

===Electromagnetics===
Elements of vector calculus: divergence and curl; Gauss' and Stokes' theorems, Maxwell's equations: differential and integral forms. Wave equation, Poynting vector. Plane waves: propagation through various media; reflection and refraction; phase and group velocity; skin depth. Transmission lines: characteristic impedance; impedance transformation; Smith chart; impedance matching; pulse excitation. Waveguides: modes in rectangular waveguides; boundary conditions; cut-off frequencies; dispersion relations. Antennas: Dipole antennas; antenna arrays; radiation pattern; reciprocity theorem, antenna gain. Additional basic fundamental in electrical are to be study

===Network theory===
Network graphs: matrices associated with graphs; incidence, fundamental cut set and fundamental circuit matrices. Solution methods: nodal and mesh analysis. Network theorems: superposition, Thevenin and Norton's maximum power transfer, Wye-Delta transformation. Steady state sinusoidal analysis using phasors. Linear constant coefficient differential equations; time domain analysis of simple RLC circuits, Solution of network equations using Laplace transform: frequency domain analysis of RLC circuits. 2-port network parameters: driving point and transfer functions. State equations.

===Electronic devices and circuits===
'''''Electronic Devices''':'' Energy bands in silicon, intrinsic and extrinsic silicon. Carrier transport in silicon: diffusion current, drift current, mobility, resistivity.

==Certification==
The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may...seal engineering work for public and private clients". [4] This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. [5] In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. [6] In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. [7] An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.

Significant professional bodies for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]](IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature on electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 300 conferences annually. [8] The IET publishes 14 journals, has a worldwide membership of 120,000, certifies Chartered Engineers in the United Kingdom and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8301">'''Emily Barton''' (born 1969) is an American novelist, critic, and academic. She is the author of three novels:  ''The Testament of Yves Gundron'' (2000), ''Brookland'' (2006) and ''The Book of Esther'' (2016).

==Background and education==
Barton was raised in [[New Jersey]], where she attended [[Kent Place School]]. She attended [[Harvard College]], from which she graduated ''summa cum laude'' and a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society. She also earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in fiction writing from the [[Iowa Writers’ Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;''Emily Barton, Thomas Hopkins'' (wedding announcement), published in ''The New York Times'', November 26, 2006. Available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/fashion/weddings/26barton.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==
Barton’s first novel, ''The Testament of Yves Gundron'', was published by [[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]] in January 2000. The book’s titular character is an inventor in the primitive and isolated farming village of Mandragora. When Gundron invents the [[Horse harness|harness]] – a device which alters the nature of farming – the villagers' lives change irrevocably. As Yves begins to recount the story of these changes, Ruth Blum, a Harvard anthropologist, arrives to study the village. Although the novel at first appears to take place in the [[Middle Ages]], Yves’s brother tells tales of travels to "[[Indo-China]]," and the villagers sing songs that are demonstrably examples of the [[blues]].

Some critics found Barton's technique of juxtaposing cultural milieus jarring.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, John ''Future Shock'', ''The New York Times'', February 13, 2000, available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/books/future-shock.html?scp=3&amp;sq=john%20crowley%20testament%20yves%20gundron&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;  But many appreciated the novel's postmodern gamesmanship. In a rare blurb, the famously reticent writer [[Thomas Pynchon]] praised ''Yves Gundron'' as “[b]lessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt—a story that moves with ease and certainty, deeply respecting the given world even as it shines with the integrity of dream,”&lt;ref&gt;Offman, Craig, ''How to get a blurb from Thomas Pynchon'', Salon.com, October 15, 1999, online at  http://www.salon.com/books/log/1999/10/15/pynchon_blurb/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and John Freeman, writing for ''[[Time Out New York]]'', called it “An engrossing folktale that, in our technology-crazed era, ought to be required reading.”&lt;ref&gt;blurb is visible on the novel's Amazon sales page at https://www.amazon.com/Testament-Yves-Gundron-Emily-Barton/dp/product-description/0374221790&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Yves Gundron'' was named a ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of the Year for 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''Notable Books'', in the ''New York Times'', December 3, 2000, available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/books/notable-books.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has been translated into Dutch, French, Norwegian, and Greek.

Barton's second novel, ''Brookland'', was published in 2006. ''Brookland'' takes as its basis [[Thomas Pope]]’s "Rainbow Bridge", a bridge that was proposed for the [[East River]] nearly a hundred years before the construction of [[John Roebling]]’s [[Brooklyn Bridge]], but which was never actually built.&lt;ref&gt;Benfey, Christopher, ''The View From The Bridge'', The New York Review of Books, August 10, 2006, available online at http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19214&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Brookland'', the bridge is the brainchild not of Pope but of a character invented by Barton: Prudence ("Prue") Winship, the proprietor of a successful gin distillery she inherited from her father. The novel is the story of the costs, both financial and personal, that the planning, construction, and ultimate destruction of the bridge exact from Prue and her community. Upon its publication, ''Brookland'' received widespread praise; in a review in the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' magazine, Joan Acocella wrote that Prue Winship "is not a ‘good-models’ feminist heroine, nor is she one of the bad-girl heroines of second-stage feminism. She is a thorny, struggling soul. Together with the book’s profound treatment of the spiritual ills born of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], this wonderful character is Barton’s main gift to us.”&lt;ref&gt;Acocella, Joan, ''Big River'', ''New Yorker'', April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Brookland'' was also named a ''New York Times'' Notable Book,&lt;ref&gt;''100 Notable Books of the Year'', ''The New York Times'', December 4, 2005, available online at https://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/review/20061203notable-books.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the twenty-five best works of fiction and poetry of the year by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

Her third novel, ''The Book of Esther'', is an alternate history tale in which the sixteen year-old heroine leads the resistance of a Jewish Empire against a German invasion in 1942, using magic and steampunk technology.

==Other writings==
Barton’s fiction has appeared in ''[[Conjunctions]]'', ''[[Story magazine]]'', and ''[[American Short Fiction]]'', and she has published essays in such venues as Moistworks.com and the ''[[Boston Review]]''. She frequently writes book reviews for the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times Book Review]]'', and ''[[Bookforum]]''.

==Personal life==
Barton joined the Creative Writing faculty at [[Oberlin College]] in 2018.

The '''Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index''' ('''FSPI'''), a product of [[Academic Analytics]], is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] designed to create benchmark standards for the measurement of academic and scholarly quality within and among [[United States]] research [[university|universities]].

The index is based on a set of [[statistics|statistical]] [[algorithm]]s developed by [[Lawrence B. Martin]] and [[Anthony Olejniczak]]. It measures the annual amount and impact of faculty scholarly work in several areas, including:
* Publications (how many books and [[peer-review]]ed journal articles have been published and what proportion of the faculty is involved in publication activity?)
* Citations of journal publications (who is referring to those journal articles in subsequent work?)
* Federal research funding (what and how many projects have been deemed of sufficient value to merit federal dollars, and at what level of funding?)
* Awards and honors (a key indicator of innovative thinking and/or scholarly excellence that has impacted the discipline over a period)

The FSPI analysis creates, by academic field of study, a statistical score and a ranking based on the cumulative scoring of a program's faculty using these quantitative measures compared against national standards within the particular discipline. Individual program scores can then be combined to demonstrate the quality of the scholarly work of the entire university. This information is gathered for over 230,000 faculty members representing 118 academic disciplines in roughly 7,300 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] programs throughout more than 350 universities in the United States.

==Rankings approach==
Unlike other annual [[college and university rankings]], ''e.g.'', the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' annual survey, the FSPI focuses on research institutions as defined by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]]. It draws on the approach used by the [[United States National Research Council]] (NRC), which publishes a ranking of U.S.-based graduate programs approximately every ten years, but focuses on providing a more frequently-gathered set of benchmark measurements that do not include the qualitative and subjective reputation assessments favored by the NRC and other ranking systems.

==History==
The system for evaluating university programs that forms the basis of the FSPI was developed by Lawrence Martin and Anthony Olejniczak of [[Stony Brook University]]. Martin had been studying, speaking, and writing about faculty scholarly productivity since 1995. During that period,{{Vague|date=May 2009}} a series of discipline-specific, per-capita regression models was created and tested to evaluate their accuracy and the feasibility of predicting the academic reputation of the faculty of doctoral programs.

These prototype materials employed data from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s 1995 publication ''Continuity and Change'' (and the subsequent CD-ROM publication of data), describing and evaluating American Ph.D. programs by field. Martin and Olejniczak found that the reputation of a program (as measured by faculty scholarly reputation from a survey conducted by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]) could be predicted well using a discipline-specific regression equation derived from quantitative, per capita data available for each program (the number of journal articles, citations, federally funded grants, and honorific awards). Reputation could be predicted with high statistical significance but important deviations from the regression line were also apparent; that is to say, some schools were outperforming their reputation, while others were under-performing. The prototype materials based on this method, and the data from the 1995 NRC study, were subsequently presented at numerous academic conferences from 1996 to 2004, and have formed the basis on which the FSP Index was developed.

Unfortunately, like many academic productivity algorithms, the FSPI is not without major flaws. It fails to adequately differentiate among and apply appropriate measures to evaluating the very distinct academic fields represented in most colleges and universities. Furthermore, a number of specific objections have been raised about how the FSPI measures scholarly productivity. Among them are: 1) inadequate—or inconsistent—weighting of quality of journals in which publications appear; 2) failure to differentiate labor involved in producing different types of publications (publications based on secondary sources and those based on tedious and deep research are not differentiated—hence departments with many faculty members who write much but research little are better rated; 3) failure to differentiate between scholarly concentrations of departments. Departments with faculty who are more involved in obscure, non-mainstream research are less cited than those involved in fashionable, mainstream areas of research and scholarship; 4) citation indexes, extensively used in scholarly productivity indexes, do not measure citations in books; 5) citation indexes are more appropriate for hard science disciplines and less appropriate for humanities disciplines; 6) non-conventional publications, which are increasing in number (e.g. - Web sites and on-line publications, audio and media productions) are ignored; 7) use of such indexes promotes "researching and publishing to the index" in order to preserve and enlarge university, government, and private grant support—and indirectly promote conservative, safe, mainstream research and publications.

In spite of these objections, today the product is used by numerous universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academicanalytics.com/About/ClientList.aspx Academic Analytics Client List&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191800/http://www.academicanalytics.com/About/ClientList.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FreshMinistries''' is a non-profit organization based in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] whose goal is to eradicate poverty, improve race relations and build stronger communities. The group focuses on economic development, job training and health initiatives in core-city Jacksonville and is also engaged in international projects. 

==History==
The organization was founded in 1994 by [[Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee, III|the Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee, III]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest who was rector at [[Church of Our Saviour (Jacksonville, Florida)]] for more than a decade. In its early years, the group focused on programs to promote financial literacy, youth mentoring, housing development and crime prevention, particularly in East Jacksonville. Dr. Lee continues to serve as CEO of the organization.

==Current initiatives==
FreshMinistries has worked to achieve the [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) to eliminate poverty through a number of initiatives. Current projects include: 

*'''Fresh Futures Youth Program''', helping more than 100 young people each year gain life skills and summer employment. Fresh Futures is a year-round educational and youth employment initiative for youth ages 14–19. The program focuses on using education and social outreach to help adolescents set healthy goals, succeed in school and work, and improve their mental and physical well-being.  Qualifying students are placed in summer jobs, thanks to partnerships with employers throughout the community.
*'''Fresh Futures II''', offering a new start to youth who have come into contact with the criminal justice system. The mission of this program, funded with a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor, is to address the educational and employment barriers of 188 court-involved youth and young adults while helping them develop the employment skills needed to obtain good jobs. The program equips court-involved youth with skills to enable them to find work and earn higher wages and helps participants move forward successfully by combining the most promising workforce and juvenile justice strategies available.
*'''LifePoint Career Institute''', which has trained more than 900 unemployed and underemployed individuals for employment in the hospitality and healthcare fields. Eighty-seven percent of program graduates gain employment and retain their jobs for more than 9 months. The Institute provides training in nursing, hospitality and aquaponics farming. Curriculum includes job-specific training, self-management, money management, problem solving, time management, grooming, and developing self-esteem. Job search assistance includes classes on setting personal goals, workplace procedures, resume writing, completing applications, work ethics and interviewing.

*'''Beaver Street Enterprise Center''', the region's only core-city business incubator, was launched as an initiative of FreshMinistries, Inc., with support from the Jacksonville Economic Development Corporation, and opened its doors in 2003. Located in the City's northwest quadrant in both State Enterprise and Federal Empowerment Zones, the Center has helped launch more than 100 new businesses, created more than 2000 new jobs and generated more than $300 million in economic impact. BSEC was voted International Business Incubator of the Year by the National Business Incubator Association in 2010.
*'''Aquaponics''': FreshMinistries opened a 6,000-square-foot aquaponics training center in Jacksonville in 2017, raising fish and marketable produce. In 2015, FreshMinistries received a $1.98 million grant from the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] to launch an aquaponics training center in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is under development. 

==2010 Haiti earthquake response==
In the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], FreshMinistries and its international arm, Be The Change International (BTCI) were asked by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate a major aid and relief operation there. The organizations' emergency relief effort shipped to the Haitian people many supplies, including three ambulances (one of which was delivered to the Haitian government), emergency aid, food, water, water purification systems, clothing, school supplies, large generators, and 147 large tents to serve as temporary schools and shelter.

==Local support==
[[Tom Petway|Tom and Betty Petway]] made a $1 million gift donation in December, 2003. The couple had worked with the organization since the late 1990s and respected the work the group does. Petway was CEO of [[Zurich Insurance Services]] and said at the time: "We're impressed with the work FreshMinistries has done in Jacksonville in creating opportunities for people of all races and faith traditions to participate economically and socially in our community. The organization needs the financial backing to continue the work it has started in the community, including assisting with other service organizations and ministries in the city."
FreshMinistries used the money for several existing programs, including the Beaver Street Enterprise Center business incubator, youth programs, college internships and financial literacy initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122303/met_14373188.shtml Florida Times-Union: December 23, 2003-Petways give $1 million to ministry by Cynthia L. Garza]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has also received considerable support from Jacksonville philanthropists Delores and Wayne Weaver. The organization's east Jacksonville community center, the Weaver Center for Community Outreach, is named in honor of the couple.

FreshMinistries receives ongoing state support through the Florida Department of Children and Families, as well as private contributions. 

==AIDS grant==

==Noteworthy accomplishments==
'''Relief for Haiti''' - Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Washington, D.C. asked FreshMinistries and Be The Change International, to coordinate a large-scale effort to bring desperately needed doctors, medical technicians, translators and pharmaceuticals to Haiti.  FreshMinistries and Be The Change International responded quickly and efficiently, delivering much needed goods to the country.

'''Crime rate drop in Jacksonville's Eastside''' - In late 2009, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Officer Stephen Gallagher announced at a community meeting on the Eastside that violent crime in the area was down 34 percent and property crime was down 32 percent from 2008. Gallagher credited the Eastside Neighborhood Association, an initiative of FreshMinistries, as an "extremely important" part of the drop in crime.
Also responsible for the drop in crime were neighborhood cleanups and several neighborhood anti-crime walks organized by FreshMinistries to include Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford, local council persons, area patrol officers and neighborhood leaders.

'''Jacksonville chosen for Financial Access Pilot''' - In April 2008, Jacksonville, FL was chosen as one of eight cities in the U.S. to participate in a new pilot program to "increase financial education and bank and credit union accounts for Americans currently outside of the financial mainstream." The pilot was recommended by several members of the President's Council on Financial Literacy, including Dr. Lee.
Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton said, "We're honored to have Jacksonville chosen to participate in this worthwhile new initiative. Our existing efforts, under the leadership of FreshMinistries, recognized in 2005 by the U.S. Treasury for Excellence in Financial Literacy … will be able to reach more low-to-moderate income families and help them save for the future."

'''Change Agent''' - In 2006, [[Robert V. Lee|The Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee III]], founder and CEO of FreshMinistries, was named a "Change Agent" by the Florida Times-Union for creating FreshMinistries and, "helping people start businesses, revitalize their neighborhoods and get out of debt."

'''Operation New Hope''' - In 1999, FreshMinistries launched an initiative, called Operation New Hope, to train "forgotten" adults (those with troubled backgrounds) in Jacksonville in the construction industry, leading to employment opportunities. Aside from restoring individuals the program also restored neighborhoods and provided low income housing opportunities for core city residents. Operation New Hope is now no longer affiliated with FreshMinistries, having become its own separate, sustainable entity, and has since expanded its reach and operations in Jacksonville to include the re-entry and training of recently incarcerated individuals.

'''Klutho building restoration''' - In 1998, the City of Jacksonville asked FreshMinistries to take over the restoration of an important historical landmark, The Klutho Apartment Building, designed by Henry John Klutho, as part of a city-wide effort to revitalize economic growth in the Springfield neighborhood. The building now houses nonprofits and small businesses that are also working to restore Springfield.

'''''Geeks &amp; Greeks''''' is a semi-autobiographical [[graphic novel]] written by humorist [[Steve Altes]], illustrated by [[Andy Fish]], and colored by [[Veronica Fish]]. It includes a foreword by novelist [[Matthew Pearl]] and is dedicated to [[Sean Collier]]. ''Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks'' is set at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and locations in [[Boston]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Quincy Quarries]].&lt;ref name="Patriot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/entertainment/20161201/quincy-quarries-star-in-new-graphic-novel |title= Quincy Quarries Star in New Graphic Novel |last1=Barbuto |first1=Dana |website=PatriotLedger.com |publisher=The Patriot Ledger (Quincy, MA) | date= 2016-12-01 |access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was inspired by [[hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's hacking culture]] and the writer's experiences with fraternity [[hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/536531/steve-altes-84-sm-86-sm-86/ |title= Humor Writer to Publish Graphic Novel on Hacks |last1=Maxwell |first1=Jill |website=TechnologyReview.com |publisher=Technology Review |date= 2015-04-21 |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/05/05/geeks-and-greeks-graphic-novel-depicting-history-of-mit-hacks-on-kickstarter/ |title= You Can Help Turn MIT's History of Hacks Into a Graphic Novel |last1=Landry |first1=Lauren |website=bostinno.streetwise.co |publisher=BostInno |date= 2014-05-05 |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At MIT a hack is a clever, benign prank or unsanctioned public display or installation that requires technical sophistication to execute and often incorporates an offbeat sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/ |title= Hacks at MIT |website=hacks.mit.edu |publisher=MIT |date= 2016-09-07 |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks'' has been described as ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' meets ''[[Animal House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccrusaders.com/review-geeks-and-greeks/ |title= Review: Geeks &amp; Greeks |last1=Hughes |first1=Johnny |website=ComicCrusaders.com |publisher=Comic Crusaders | date= 2016-09-08 |access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks'' is the story of Jim Walden, a brilliant and charming young man who wants desperately to become an astronaut. Unfortunately he gets kicked out of high school for a prank. After a viral video catches the attention of MIT's admission office he is offered a scholarship to MIT.

At MIT Jim pledges Alpha Zeta Omicron (AZO), a raucous fraternity, and gets indoctrinated into MIT's hacking culture. Jim and his pledge brothers endure all manner of high-tech hazing at the hands of Luke Bardolf, a gruff AZO senior who is obsessed with pulling off the greatest hack at MIT.

Jim befriends Dexter Garfinkel (the ultimate nerd and AZO's live-in problem set slave) and begins a romance with Natalie Taylor (the Shakespeare-loving receptionist at a fertility clinic). Other characters include Professor Neustadt (who mentors Jim and helps him understand the significance and meaning of hacks) and the Bridge Troll (a homeless man who Jim aids).

When an elaborate prank goes wrong, MIT's Discipline Committee sanctions Jim and forces him to make restitution, leading Jim to Natalie's fertility clinic as a way to make money quickly. Meanwhile Jim and Luke engage in an escalating back-and-forth prank battle, which leads to a climactic showdown at the Quincy Quarries after Luke nearly kills Dexter with his recklessness.

In the end Jim draws on his hacking prowess in a frantic race against time to prove to MIT that he deserves to be there, save his scholarship, make restitution with a bold gamble, exact revenge against Luke, win back Natalie, and inspire Dexter to revolt against his indentured servitude.

==Autobiographical and historical content==
Elements of ''Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks'' were inspired by hazing incidents Altes witnessed as an MIT student as well as actual hacks, such as:

==Reception==
Critical reception has been generally favorable. The [[Miami Herald]] called ''Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks'' a "funny, human story of struggle and redemption with believable characters in outrageous but plausible situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/books/article95140867.html |title= From John Lewis to Jughead, a Roundup of Graphic Novels |last1=Pachter |first1=Richard |website=MiamiHerald.com |publisher=Miami Herald |date= 2016-08-11 |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library Journal]] called it an "amusing romp" and said its "inventive dialog effectively juxtaposes outrageousness with hyperacademic geekery, like the 'milliHelen' measure of beauty, the insult 'nanophallus,' and a football cheer based on pi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2016/09/books/graphic-novels/altesfishs-beaumont-clowes-cornellparker-girard-jackson-schulz-graphic-novels-reviews-september-15-2016/ |title=

He obtained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in natural sciences from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1952 and a PhD in psychology from the [[University of London]] in 1964. Whilst visiting professor of educational technology, he obtained the first [[DSc]] from the [[Open University]] and an [[ScD]] from his college, [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] Cambridge in 1995. From the 1960s Pask directed commercial research at System Research Ltd in [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond]], Surrey and his partnership, Pask Associates.

== Work==
Pask's primary contributions to [[cybernetics]], [[educational psychology]], [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]] and [[systems theory]], as well as to numerous other fields, was his emphasis on the personal nature of reality, and on the process of learning as stemming from the consensual agreement of interacting actors in a given environment ("conversation").

His work was complex, extensive, and deeply thought out, at least until late in his life, when he benefited less often from critical feedback of research peers, reviewers of proposals and reports to government bodies in the US and UK, and, perhaps most especially, the tension between experimentation and theoretical stands. His publications, however, represent a storehouse of ideas that are not fully mined.&lt;ref name="PDFs of some of the Papers of Gordon Pask"&gt;[http://pangaro.com/pask/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pask's most well known work was the development of:
*''[[Conversation Theory]]'': is a cybernetic and dialectic framework that offers a scientific theory to explain how interactions lead to "construction of knowledge", or, as Pask preferred "knowing" (wishing to preserve both the dynamic/kinetic quality, and the necessity for there to be a "knower").&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Pask (1975). ''The Cybernetics of Human Learning and Performance. Hutchinson''.&lt;/ref&gt; It came out of his work on instructional design and models of individual learning styles. In regard to learning styles, he identified conditions required for concept sharing and described the [[learning styles]] ''holist'', ''serialist'', and their optimal mixture ''versatile''. He proposed a rigorous model of analogy relations.
*''Interactions of Actors Theory'': This is a generalised account of the eternal kinetic processes that support kinematic conversations bounded with beginnings and ends in all media. It is reminiscent of Freud's [[psychodynamics]], [[Gregory Bateson|Bateson's]] [[panpsychism]] (see "Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity" 1980). Pask's nexus of analogy, dependence and mechanical spin produces the differences that are central to [[cybernetics]].

Pask participated in the seminal exhibition "[[Cybernetic Serendipity]]" (ICA London, 1968) with the interactive installation "Colloquy of Mobiles", continuing his ongoing dialogue with the visual and performing arts. (cf Rosen 2008, and Dreher's History of Computer Art)
Pask influenced such diverse individuals as [[Ted Nelson]], who references Pask in [[Computer Lib/Dream Machines]] and whose interest in hypermedia is much like Pask's [[entailment meshes]]; and [[Nicholas Negroponte]], whose earliest research efforts at the [[Architecture Machine Group]] on "idiosyncratic systems" and software-based partners for design have their roots in Pask's work as a consultant to Negroponte's efforts.

== Interactions of Actors Theory ==
While working with clients in the last years of his life, Gordon Pask produced an axiomatic scheme&lt;ref&gt;Short discussion in context of [[Upper ontology (information science)]] and the inadequacy of serial (digital computer) modelling [http://www.cybsys.co.uk/ProtoforMeta.htm#axioms] Retrieved 9 June 2008 at cybsys.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; for his '''Interactions of Actors Theory''', less well-known than his Conversation Theory. "Interactions of Actors (IA), Theory and Some Applications", as the manuscript is entitled, is essentially a concurrent spin calculus applied to the living environment with strict topological constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Green (2003). [http://www.cybsoc.org/gordon.htm Gordon Pask]. At cybsoc.org. Retrieved 1 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable associates of Gordon Pask, [[Gerard de Zeeuw]], was a key contributor to the development of Interactions of Actors theory.

[[File:piarcs.png|thumb|right|The figure shows Pask's "repulsive carapace" force surrounding a concept. It is shown by the minus sign, it has a clockwise or anticlockwise spin – compare [[Spin (physics)|Spin]]. The spin signature is determined by the residual [[parity (physics)|parity]] of a braid which is the thick line enclosed by the cylinder. The plus sign labels a process seeking closure by "eating its own tail". Three of these toroidal structures can produce a [[Borromean link]] model of the minimal stable concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of these structures can be investigated with [http://knotplot.com Scharein's KnotPlot] software.&lt;/ref&gt; Pask said the prismatic [[tensegrity]] could be used as a model for the interaction in a Borromean link.]]
[[File:Minimal Concept Model.png|thumb|right|Prismatic Tensegrity space filling [[unit cell]] of a minimal concept. The red, blue and green rods exert compressive repulsions, the black lines represent attractive tensions. The Borromean link shown is regarded as a resonance form (c.f. [[tautomerism]]&lt;ref&gt;Pask (1993) fig.35 para. 219&lt;/ref&gt;) of Pask's minimal persisting concept triple.]]
Interactions of Actors Theory (IA) is a process theory.&lt;ref name="Pask1993"&gt;Gordon Pask (1993), ''Interactions of Actors (IA), Theory and Some Applications''&lt;/ref&gt; As a means to describe the [[interdisciplinary]] nature of his work, Pask would make analogies to physical theories in the classic [[positivist]] enterprises of the [[social science]]s. Pask sought to apply the axiomatic properties of agreement or epistemological dependence to produce a "sharp-valued" social science with precision comparable to the results of the hard sciences. It was out of this inclination that he would develop his Interactions of Actors Theory. Pask's concepts produce relations in all media and he regarded IA as a [[process theory]]. In his [[Complementarity (physics)|Complementarity Principle]] he stated "Processes produce products and all products (finite, bounded coherences) are produced by processes".&lt;ref&gt;Pask (1996) p.355 and Postulate (20) p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Most importantly Pask also had his [[Pauli exclusion principle|Exclusion Principle]]. He proved that no two concepts or products could be the same because of their different histories. He called this the "[[Gordon Pask#No Doppelgangers|No Doppelgangers]]" clause or edict.&lt;ref name="Pask1993"/&gt; Later he reflected  "Time is incommensurable for Actors".&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"&gt;Gordon Pask (1996). ''Heinz von Foerster's Self-Organisation, the Progenitor of Conversation and Interaction Theories''.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw these properties as necessary to produce differentiation and innovation or new coherences in physical nature and, indeed, minds.

In 1995, Pask stated what he called his Last Theorem: "Like concepts repel and unlike concepts attract". For ease of application Pask stated the differences and similarities of descriptions (the products of processes) were context and perspective dependent. In the last three years of his life Pask presented models based on [[Knot theory]] [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s which described minimal persisting concepts. He interpreted these as acting as computing elements which exert repulsive forces to interact and persist in filling the space. The knots, links and braids of his entailment mesh models of concepts, which could include tangle-like processes seeking "tail-eating" closure, Pask called "tapestries".

His analysis proceeded with like seeming concepts repelling or unfolding but after a sufficient duration of interaction (he called this duration "faith") a pair of similar or like-seeming concepts will always produce a difference and thus an attraction. Amity (availability for interaction), respectability (observability), responsibility (able to respond to stimulus), unity (not uniformity) were necessary properties to produce agreement (or dependence) and agreement-to-disagree (or relative independence) when Actors interact. Concepts could be applied imperatively or permissively when a Petri (see [[Petri net]]) condition for synchronous transfer of meaningful information occurred. Extending his physical analogy Pask associated the interactions of thought generation with [[radiation]] : "operations generating thoughts and penetrating conceptual boundaries within participants, excite the concepts bounded as oscillators, which, in ridding themselves of this surplus excitation, produce radiation"&lt;ref&gt;Pask 1993, paragraph 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, IA supports the earlier kinematic Conversation Theory work where minimally two concurrent concepts were required to produce a non-trivial third. One distinction separated the similarity and difference of any pair in the minimum triple. However, his formal methods denied the competence of mathematics or digital serial and parallel processes to produce applicable descriptions because of their innate pathologies in locating the infinitesimals of dynamic equilibria ([[Stafford Beer]]'s "Point of Calm"). He dismissed the digital computer as a kind of kinematic "magic lantern". He saw mechanical models as the future for the concurrent kinetic computers required to describe natural processes. He believed that this implied the need to extend [[quantum computing]] to emulate true field concurrency rather than the current [[von Neumann architecture]].

Reviewing IA&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt; he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Interaction of actors has no specific beginning or end. It goes on forever. Since it does so it has very peculiar properties. Whereas a conversation is mapped (due to a possibility of obtaining a vague kinematic, perhaps picture-frame image, of it, onto Newtonian time, precisely because it has a beginning and end), an interaction, in general, cannot be treated in this manner. Kinematics are inadequate to deal with life: we need kinetics. Even so as in the minimal case of a strict conversation we cannot construct the [[truth value]], metaphor or [[Analogy#Cybernetics|analogy]] of A and B. The A, B differences are generalizations about a coalescence of concepts on the part of A and B; their commonality and coherence is the similarity. The difference (reiterated) is the differentiation of A and B (their agreements to disagree, their incoherences). Truth value in this case meaning the coherence between all of the interacting actors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is essential to postulate vectorial times (where components of the vectors are incommensurate) and furthermore times which interact with each other in the manner of Louis Kaufmann's knots and tangles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In experimental [[Epistemology]] Pask, the "philosopher mechanic", produced a tool kit to analyse the basis for knowledge and criticise the teaching and application of knowledge from all fields: the law, social and system sciences to mathematics, physics and biology. In establishing the vacuity of invariance Pask was challenged with the invariance of [[atomic number]]. "Ah", he said "the atomic hypothesis". He rejected this instead preferring the infinite nature of the productions of waves.

Pask held that concurrence is a necessary condition for modelling brain functions and he remarked IA was meant to stand AI, Artificial Intelligence, on its head. Pask believed it was the job of cybernetics to compare and contrast. His IA theory showed how to do this. [[Heinz von Foerster]] called him a genius,&lt;ref&gt;von Foerster pp 35–42 in Glanville (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; "Mr. Cybernetics", the "cybernetician's cybernetician".

=== Hewitt's actor model ===
The Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger approach concerns sequential processing and inter-process communication in digital, serial, kinematic computers. It is a parallel or pseudo-concurrent theory as is the theory of concurrency. See [[Concurrency (computer science)|Concurrency]]. In Pask's true field concurrent theory kinetic processes can interrupt (or, indeed, interact with) each other, simply reproducing or producing a new resultant force within a coherence (of concepts) but without buffering delays or priority.&lt;ref&gt;Pask 1993 paras 100, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==No Doppelgangers==
"There are no Doppelgangers" is a fundamental [[theorem]], [[edict]] or [[clause]] of [[cybernetics]] due to Pask in support of his theories of learning and interaction in all media: Conversation Theory and Interactions of Actors Theory. It accounts for physical [[wikt:differentiation|differentiation]] and is Pask's [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Pask (1993) para 82 and Table 4&lt;/ref&gt; It states no two products of concurrent interaction can be the same because of their different dynamic contexts and perspectives. No Doppelgangers is necessary to account for the production by interaction and [[intermodulation]] (c.f. [[Beat (acoustics)|beats]]) of different, evolving, persisting and coherent forms. Two proofs are presented both due to Pask.

=== Duration proof ===
Consider a pair of moving, dynamic participants &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; producing an interaction &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt;. Their separation will vary during &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt;. The duration of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; observed from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; will be different from the duration of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; observed from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pask (1993) para 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle s&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; be the start and finish times for the transfer of meaningful information, we can write:
{|
|-
|
''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''B'',

''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''B'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''B'',

''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''B'',
|
''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''B''

''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''A''

''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' ≠ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''B''
|}

Thus

''A'' ≠ ''B''

[[Q.E.D.]]

Pask remarked:&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conversation is defined as having a beginning and an end and time is vectorial. The components of the vector are [[Commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] (in duration). On the other hand actor interaction time is vectorial with components that are incommensurable. In the general case there is no well-defined beginning and interaction goes on indefinitely. As a result the time vector has incommensurable components. Both the quantity and quality differ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No Doppelgangers applies in both the [[Conversation Theory]]'s kinematic domain (bounded by beginnings and ends) where times are commensurable and in the eternal kinetic [[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory .28IA.29|Interactions of Actors]] domain where times are incommensurable.

=== Reproduction proof ===
The second proof&lt;ref name="Pask1993"/&gt; is more reminiscent of [[R.D. Laing]]:&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Laing (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Your concept of your concept is not my concept of your concept—a reproduced concept is not the same as the original concept. Pask defined concepts as persisting, countably infinite, recursively packed spin processes (like many cored cable, or skins of an onion) in '''any''' medium (stars, liquids, gases, solids, machines and, of course, brains) that produce relations.

Here we prove ''A''(''T'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''B''(''T'').

''D'' means "description of" and &lt;Con ''A''(''T''), ''D'' ''A''(''T'')&gt; reads A's concept of ''T'' produces A's description of ''T'', evoking [[Dirac notation]] (required for the production of the quanta of thought: the transfer of "set-theoretic tokens", as Pask puts it in 1996&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt;).

: ''TA'' = ''A''(''T'') = &lt;Con A(T), D A(T)&gt;, A's Concept of T,

: ''TB'' = ''B''(''T'') = &lt;Con B(T), D B(T)&gt;, B's Concept of T,

or, in general

: ''TZ'' = ''Z''(''T'') = &lt;Con Z (T), D Z(T)&gt;,

also, in general

: AA = A(A) = &lt;Con A(A), D A(A)&gt;, A's Concept of A,

: AB = A(B) = &lt;Con A(B), D A(B)&gt;, A's Concept of B.

and vice versa, or, in general terms

: ZZ = Z(Z) = &lt;Con Z(Z), D Z&gt;,

given that for all Z and all T, the concepts

: TA = A(T) is not equal to TB = B(T)

and that

AA = A(A) is not equal to BA = B(A) and vice versa, hence, there are no Doppelgangers.

Q.E.D.

===A mechanical model ===
Pask attached a piece of string to a bar&lt;ref&gt;Green, Nick. "On Gordon Pask." ''Kybernetes'' 30.5/6 (2001): 673-682.&lt;/ref&gt;  with three knots in it. Then he attached a piece of elastic to the bar with three knots in it. One observing actor, A, on the string would see the knotted intervals on the other actor as varying as the elastic was stretched and relaxed corresponding to the relative motion of B as seen from A. The knots correspond to the beginning of the experiment then the start and finish of the A/B interaction. Referring to the three intervals, where  x, y, z, are the separation distances of the knots from the bar and each other, he noted x &gt; y &gt; z on the string for participant A does not imply x &gt; z for participant B on the elastic. A change of separation between A and B producing [[Doppler shift]]s during interaction, recoil or the differences in relativistic [[proper time]] for A and B, would account for this for example.  On occasion a second knotted string was tied to the bar representing [[coordinate time]].

=== Further context ===
To set in further context Pask won a prize from [[Old Dominion University]] for his [[Complementarity (physics)|Complementarity Principle]]: "All processes produce products and all products are produced by processes". This can be written:

Ap(Con&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;(T)) =&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; (T) where =&gt; means produces and Ap means the "application of", D means "description of" and Z is the concept mesh or coherence of which T is part. This can also be written

: &lt;Ap(Con&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; (T)), D&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; (T)&gt;.

Pask distinguishes Imperative (written &amp;Ap or IM) from Permissive Application (written Ap)&lt;ref&gt;Pask (1993) para 188&lt;/ref&gt; where information is transferred in the [[Petri net]] manner, the token appearing as a hole in a torus producing a [[Klein bottle]] containing recursively packed concepts.&lt;ref name="Pask1993"/&gt;

Pask's "hard" or "repulsive"&lt;ref name="Pask1993"/&gt; [[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory .28IA.29|carapace]] was a condition he required for the persistence of concepts. He endorsed Rescher's [[Truth#Coherence theory|Coherence Theory]] of Truth approach where a set membership criterion of similarity also permitted differences amongst set or coherence members, but he insisted repulsive force was exerted at set and members' coherence boundaries. He said of Spencer Brown's [[Laws of Form]] that [[Laws of Form#The form .28Chapter 1.29|distinctions]] must exert repulsive forces. This is not yet accepted by Spencer Brown and others. Without a repulsion, or Newtonian reaction at the boundary, sets, their members or interacting participants would diffuse away forming a "smudge"; Hilbertian marks on paper would not be preserved. Pask, the mechanical philosopher, wanted to apply these ideas to bring a new kind of rigour to cybernetic models.

Some followers of Pask emphasise his late work, done in the closing chapter of his life, which is neither as clear nor as grounded as the prior decades of research and machine- and theory-building. This tends to skew the impression gleaned by researchers as to Pask's contribution or even his lucidity. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Most college students in Korea wear jumper.

== History ==

In the 1860s, the [[Harvard University]] [[baseball team]] in the United States was wearing the jumper's of same design for the sake of solidarity. The [[university apparel]] started when other students who saw this were wearing jumper of their design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hallym.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=8553|title=하나의 문화로 자리잡은 과잠 문화의 ‘흑과백’ - 한림학보|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why the design of the universal 'gwa-jam' settles in the form of 'baseball jumper' is closely related to this.

In Korea, since the 1980s, they have been making uniforms for the purpose of creating a sense of identity within the department. Especially when the [[Democratization Movement|democratization movement]] in the [[1980s]] peaked, the consciousness of solidarity among the members was so high that they wore uniforms. It was in the late 1990s that it began to be worn as a so-called "Gwa-jam" baseball jumper. It started to wear at the Seoul National University rugby club, and became popular with other athletic and physical education students..

== Composition ==

The universal 'gwa-jam' is a baseball jumper made of artificial [[leather]] and [[Melton (cloth)|melton]]. 'gwa-jam' usually shows the name of the university, the major, the student number, etc.

It rarely carries the name of his high school. The major is distinguished by the color of the sleeve. The universal 'gwa-jam' is a baseball jumper made of artificial leather and melton. 'gwa-jam' usually shows the name of the [[university]], the major, the student number, etc.

Universities, [[Major (disambiguation)|majors]]{{dn|date=June 2018}}, and [[club (organization)|club]]s are slightly different, but the most common design is to put the [[Capital letters|initial capital letters]] of the universities name on the chest and the student number on the arm. Also, on the back side, write down the name of the Universities in English or scholarly form, then write down 'univ' below it, and write down the name of the major at the bottom. The colors are usually matched in the universities symbol color, but they are sometimes matched to the color of the members' [[Symbol|symbols]]. In recent years, they have been drawing universities flowers on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insight.co.kr/news/146334|title=디자인 너무 예뻐 학교 옮기고 싶게 만든다는 대학별 과잠 9|work=인사이트|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==

Spring, the most common season for ''''Gwa-jam'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', is sometimes called 'Gwa-jam season'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/specialsection/esc_section/684007.html|title=‘과잠’의 계절이 돌아왔다 (The season of 'gwa-jam' is back.)|last=|first=|date=2015-03-25|work=|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Gwa-jam' is good to wear on any clothes and warm in the spring weather. In recent years, even long padding for increased warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.joins.com/article/22168963|title=대학가 점령한 롱 패딩 행렬...겨울 '과잠' 천하통일 (Long padding procession occupied by university ... Winter 'gwa-jam')|last=|first=|date=2017-12-02|work=중앙일보|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[University|university name]], [[major]], and [[student number]] are written. In addition to ‘Gwa-jam’ and long padding shape, it also matches with unique design.

'Gwa-jam', a fashion item, goes beyond clubs and clubs to meet clubs and student council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dongan.dau.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=3448|title=과잠, 어떻게 입고 있나요? ('gwa-jam', how do you wear it?)|last=|first=|date=2017-05-15|work=동아대학교 다우미디어센터|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a small group like this they wear uniform clothes for belonging feeling.

Recently, high school students also started wearing 'Gwa-jam'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/722042.html|title=이거 봤나? 우리 대학 성적…입어 봤나? 특목고 점퍼 (Have you seen this? Our college grades ... Have you tried it? Special purpose high school jumper)|last=|first=|date=2015-12-15|work=|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like universities, they are universally distributed, regardless of their affiliation and singularity / engineering. Starting in 2015, new students started to wear green 'Gwa-jam' at '[[Shinil High School]]', an autonomous private high school in [[Gangbuk District|Gangbuk-gu]], [[Seoul]]. Some students from the student council in 2014 began wearing the red "Gwa-jam" with the school name, and all the students had the same 'Gwa-jam' when they responded well. The 'Gwa-jam' culture, which is worn by university students, is spreading to foreign high schools, independent high schools, and international high schools. It is said that it started from the point of raising the pride of school and strengthening the alliance between the alumni, but it is pointed out that it may fall into 'collective superiority' from high school student.

== Awareness and evaluation ==


=== Positive view ===

'Gwa-jam' is positively evaluated as a sign of belonging and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2017&amp;no=529169|title=출신 고교명 새긴 대학교 `과잠`, 학벌주의 조장?|work=mk.co.kr|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Jae-hwi, a professor of psychology at [[Chung-Ang University|Chung-Ang University,]] analyzes that 'Gwa-jam' culture is an expression of identity, solidarity, and pride rather than school pride, and a cheap and convenient fashion item. It can also be related to the desire hierarchy theory of "Maslow theory". And that it is the desire to be recognized and belonged to others by wearing 'Gwa-jam' because it is linked to the 'social desire', the third stage of the desire hierarchy theory. In addition, Sungkyunkwan University sociology professor analyzes that it is a natural phenomenon that arises when he is proud of their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/news_detail.asp?newsId=01321846616161144&amp;mediaCodeNo=257|title=대학 이름 새긴 롱패딩 열풍…'가성비 우수' Vs '학벌과시 불편'|date=2017-12-22|work=이데일리|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative view ===

Since the 2000s, there has been criticism that 'Gwa-jam' promotes culturalism through cultural demonstration and distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/news_detail.asp?newsId=01321846616161144&amp;mediaCodeNo=257|title=대학 이름 새긴 롱패딩 열풍…'가성비 우수' Vs '학벌과시 불편'|date=2017-12-22|work=이데일리|access-date=2018-06-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a view that intellectuals who have to act with social consciousness encourage the negative social phenomenon of degreeocracy. In particularly, the prestigious 'Gwa-jam' has a relative deprivation effect on those who do not have a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/wdv/f8c04ff6f58b4af284f7a304a15ec654|title=이름 없는 과잠 = 학벌주의 그림자|website=한국일보|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later completed graduate commerce studies at the Universities of [[University of Bergen|Bergen]] and [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], and worked as a lecturer at the [[University of Iceland]] from 1973 to 1975.

==Political career==
He represented the East constituency as a member of the [[Althing]] (Icelandic Parliament) from 1974 to 1978 and from 1979 to 2003, when he was elected to represent the [[Reykjavík]] North constituency.

Retrieved April 17th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on public finance===

Early in her research career, Ladd has conducted extensive research on local [[public finance]]. She finds that commercial property in [[Boston]] has a stronger impact on the demand for local education expenditures than industrial property and criticizes the use of total property tax base per pupil as a measure for local fiscal capacity for education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41862049?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Ladd, H.F. (1975). Local education expenditures, fiscal capacity, and the composition of the property tax base. ''National Tax Journal'', 28(2), pp. 145-158.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd has also contributed to the debate on how to optimize state aid in the U.S. in order to offset fiscal disparities (low resources or high costs) across communities (with Katharine Bradbury, Mark Perrault, Andrew Reschovsky and [[John Yinger]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41791942?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Bradbury, K.L. et al. (1984). State aid to offset fiscal disparities across communities. ''National Tax Journal'', pp. 151-170..]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Yinger, Ladd has further expanded on the fiscal crisis of U.S. cities in the 1970s and early 1980s in her book ''America's Ailing Cities'', wherein she explores how it affected cities' policies and disparities between them.&lt;ref&gt;Ladd, H.F., Yinger, J. (1991). ''America's ailing cities: Fiscal health and the design of urban policy.'' Baltimore, MY: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researching local tax mimicking between neighbouring U.S. counties, Ladd finds evidence of it with regard to the burdens of total local taxes and [[property tax]]es but not of [[sales tax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/109114219202000404 Ladd, H.F. (1992). Mimicking of local tax burdens among neighboring counties. ''Public Finance Quarterly'', 20(4), pp. 450-467.]&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the relationship between public finances and local population growth in the U.S., Ladd finds a U-shaped relationship between spending and density and a positive relationship between local population growth and per capita public spending, with the effect mainly reflecting the higher population density and a larger share of local public spending, suggesting that established residents in fast-growing areas may experience declining quality in public services and/or rising local tax burdens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016604629490006X Ladd, H.F. (1994). Fiscal impacts of local population growth: A conceptual and empirical analysis.

Population growth, density and the costs of providing public services. ''Urban Studies'', 29(2), pp. 273-295.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on the economics of education===

==== Research on school accountability====

Since the mid-1990s, Ladd has performed research on the topic of school accountability. In [[Dallas]], she finds performance-based school accountability to increase the outcomes of Hispanic and Caucasian 7th-graders but not Afro-American students, and to decrease drop-out and principal turnover rates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775797000447 Ladd, H.F. (1999). The Dallas school accountability and incentive program: An evaluation of its impacts on student outcomes. ''Economics of Education Review'', 18(1), pp. 1-16.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Ladd repeatedly criticized the implementation of [[value-added modeling|value-added measures]] of school effectiveness, arguing based on her observations in e.g. [[North Carolina]] that these measures' lack of consideration for differences in schools' resources discouraged effective teachers and principals from working in schools with large shares of disadvantaged students and exacerbate educational inequality (with Randall Walsh and Arnaldo Zelli).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277570000039x Ladd, H.F., Walsh, R.P.

School-based accountability in North Carolina: The response of school principals. ''Education Administration Quarterly'', 38(4), pp. 494-529.]&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, she has argued, along with e.g. [[Eva Baker]] or [[Edward Haertel]], that test scores should only be one part of teacher evaluation and not dominate decisions about teachers' compensation or promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, E.L. et al. (2010). Problems with the Use of Student Test Scores to Evaluate Teachers. ''Economic Policy Institute Working Paper Series'', No. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research on school choice====

Ladd and Sheila Murray find no evidence of a direct effect of the share of elderly households on spending on education, though they may do so through their locational decision: as they tend to live in counties with low shares of children, the tax price of education is higher in other counties, which could decrease education spending in those counties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775700000583 Ladd, H.F., Murray, S.E. (2001). Intergenerational conflict reconsidered: County demographic structure and the demand for public education. ''Economics of Education Review'', 38(4), pp. 494-529.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[school voucher]]s, Ladd has argued that the gains in student achievement from voucher programmes are likely to be small and to harm many disadvantaged students due to parents' tendency to judge schools by the characteristics of their students, with a slightly better case being made for means-tested vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533002320950957 Ladd, H.F. (2002). School vouchers: A critical view. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 16(4), pp. 3-24.]&lt;/ref&gt; In research with Robert Bifulco on [[charter school]]s in N.C., Ladd finds that students make substantially smaller gains in achievement in charter schools than in public schools and that these effects aren't due to positive impacts of charter schools on traditional public schools, though the high rates of student turnover at charter schools appear to account for a third of the difference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/edfp.2006.1.1.50 Bifulco, R., Ladd, H.F. (2006). The impact of charter schools on student achievement: Evidence from North Carolina. ''Education Finance and Policy'', 1(1), pp. 50-90.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they find these charter schools to have raised the racial isolation of Afro-American and Caucasian students and widened their test-score gaps, in particular as students (and their families) tend to choose charter schools that are more racially isolated than students' previous schools, resulting in very few racially balanced charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.20226 Bifulco, R., Ladd, H.F. (2007). School choice, racial segregation, and test-score gaps: Evidence from North Carolina's charter school program. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 26(1), pp. 31-56.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd has also performed research on school choice and school competition outside the U.S., e.g. analyzing the liberalization and decentralization of [[New Zealand]]'s compulsory state education system during the 1990s, which yielded many cautionary lessons about the potential long-term consequences of market-based education reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/book/when-schools-compete/ Fiske, E.B., Ladd, H.F. (2001). ''When schools compete: A cautionary tale.'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research on teacher labour markets====

Together with Clotfelter and Vigdor, Ladd has also conducted extensive research on teacher labour markets. In line with Ladd's research on [[North Carolina]]'s school accountability system, Ladd, Clotfelter, Vigdor and Roger Aliaga Diaz find that this system strongly increased the turnover of high-quality teachers in schools serving low-performing students, though the extent of the decline in teacher quality at such schools remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.20003 Clotfelter, C.T. et al. (2004). Do school accountability systems make it more difficult for low-performing schools to attract and retain high-quality teachers? ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 23(2), pp. 251-271.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later research by Ladd, Clotfelter, Vigdor and Justin Wheeler confirmed that the school personnel serving students in high-poverty schools in N.C. generally have lower qualifications than those in lower poverty schools.* &lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4276&amp;context=nclr Clotfelter, C. et al. (2006). High-poverty schools and the distribution of teachers and principals. ''North Carolina Law Review'', 85(5), pp. 1345-1380.]&lt;/ref&gt; In further research in N.C., Ladd, Clotfelter and Vigdor find that the way how novice teachers are distributed by school administrators across schools and classrooms disadvantages Afro-American students&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775704001153 Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., Vigdor, J. (2005). Who teaches whom? Race and the distribution of novice teachers. ''Economics of Education Review'', 24(4), pp. 377-392.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the generally positive returns to teacher experience in students' math and reading achievement are much larger with regard to math for socioeconomically advantaged students, possibly explaining why the most highly qualified teachers often teach the most advantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/XLI/4/778.short Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., Vigdor, J.L. (2006). Teacher-student matching and the assessment of teacher effectiveness. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 41(4), pp. 778-820.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they (with Elizabeth Glennie) also find that offering higher salaries to teachers in high-poverty schools in N.C. was successful in substantially reducing these schools' teacher turnover rates, with experienced teachers displaying the strongest response.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272707001065 Clotfelter, C. et al. (2008). Would higher salaries keep teachers in high-poverty schools? Evidence from a policy intervention in North Carolina. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 92(5-6), pp. 1352-1370.]&lt;/ref&gt;  They find that gaps between Caucasian and Afro-American student achievements are large and persistent, Hispanic and Asian students tend to gain on Caucasians over their schooling, with the racial gaps in math typically widening over time for high-performing students and closing for low-performing students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/rest.91.2.398 Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., Vigdor, J.L. (2009). The academic achievement gap in grades 3 to 8. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 91(2), pp. 398-419.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they also find that teacher credentials (e.g. [[licensure]] or [[teacher certification|certification]] systematically and substantially affect student achievement and that the unequal distribution of teacher credentials by race and socioeconomic status of high school students exacerbates gaps between demographic groups' educational achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/45/3/655.short Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., Vigdor, J.L. (2010). Teacher credentials and student achievement in high school: a cross-subject analysis with student fixed effects. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 45(3), pp. 655-681.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Ladd also observes that teachers' perceptions of their working conditions are good predictors of their transitions to other schools, with school leadership as the most salient dimension of working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0162373711398128 Ladd, H.F. (2011). Teachers' perceptions of their working conditions: How predictive of planned and actual teacher movement? ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 33(2), pp. 235-261.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other research===

With regard to the economics of education, Ladd has contributed substantially to research on the relationship between poverty and education: Together with [[Jens Ludwig]] and [[Greg Duncan]], Ladd evaluates the impact of the Moving to Opportunity programme of residential mobility, wherein volunteering low-income families were randomly assigned to either receive rental subsidies for housing in low-poverty areas as well as counseling and housing search assistance, to only receive unrestricted rental subsidies or to a control group, finding that assignment to the first group considerably raised elementary school children's performance in reading and math, though there is also some evidence that teens in both experimental groups experience increases in grade retentions, drop-out rates and disciplinary actions at school due to differences between the academic and behavioural standards between their new and old schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, J. et al. (2001). Urban poverty and educational outcomes. ''Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs'', pp. 147-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in further research on the relationship between education and poverty, Ladd has strongly criticized Bush- and Obama-era efforts to improve the U.S. education system for their ignorance of the growing performance gap between the achievement of students from advantaged and disadvantaged families and their lack of focus on the educational challenges of disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.21615 Ladd, H.F. (2012). Education and poverty: Confronting the evidence. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 31(2), pp. 203-227.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of research concerns the impact of technology on education, wherein Ladd, Vigdor and Erika Martinez confirm earlier findings of large gaps between different racial and socioeconomic groups' access and use of home computers and observe that the introduction of home computer technology and high-speed Internet access in households tends to modestly decrease students' math and reading test scores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecin.12089 Vigdor, J.L., Ladd, H.F., Martinez, E. (2014). Scaling the digital divide: Home computer technology and student achievement. ''Economic Inquiry'', 52(3), pp. 1103-1119.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in another study outside the U.S., Ladd and Fiske have evaluated the post-Apartheid education reform in [[South Africa]], concluding that while genuine equal treatment of races was at hand, equality in terms of educational opportunity or adequacy remained elusive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/book/elusive-equity/ Fiske, E.B., Ladd, H.F. (2004). ''Elusive equity: Education reform in post-apartheid South Africa.'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in a much-cited study, Ladd finds strong evidence for discrimination in mortgage lending, most of which she attributes to profit-driven statistical discrimination, notably reflecting the fact that minority borrowers often display characteristics associated with lower creditworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.12.2.41 Ladd, H.F. (1998). Evidence on discrimination in mortgage lending. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 12(2), pp. 41-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Higher education in Poland''' started in the Middle Ages. In 1364 the first Polish university (later called [[Jagiellonian]]) was created in Cracow. In 1826 the first technical university was established in [[Warsaw]], leading eventually to the establishment of [[Warsaw University of Technology]], the largest technical university in Poland.
From 1919-1939 universities were focused primarily on arts, science, and engineering. Education was based solely on [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s model of university combining research and teaching. This model incorporates a strict hierarchy of authority and a considerable degree of autonomy for its governing bodies.

==Post World War II==

Many higher education institutions were established after World War II. At the end of [[communism]] (1989), there were 820 institutions in Poland, about 20 of them being engineering oriented. In the 1990s a two-tier system was reinstituted. The first tier was considered to be vocational rather than academic. The two-tier system was instituted in Poland well before it was suggested by the [[Bologna declaration]].

After 1989 higher education in Poland changed dramatically. Borders were opened, leading to free mobility and autonomy of universities in curricula and management. New laws concerning higher education, convertible Polish currency, easy communication, (telephone and [[Internet]]), and access to European education and research programs made higher education more accessible.

==The present time==
In 2001 there were 1,224,600 students&lt;ref name="cepes.ro"&gt;Szablowski, J. (2001). [http://cepes.ro/publications/pdf/hee_eng_pdf/he3_01.pdf The Role of Private Universities and Colleges in the Spatial Restructuring of Higher Education in Poland]. Higher Education in Europe. 26(3). Retrieved November 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; enrolled in the publicly funded universities and colleges. In the private universities and colleges there were 519,100 students. This number has quadrupled over previous enrollment figures. This rise in the rate of enrollment in higher education strongly influences the qualification level of the youngest age group making up the workforce.

Considering that an individual's active life lasts about forty years, more time is needed to raise the level of adult education. In a 1995 census, 6.8%&lt;ref name="cepes.ro"/&gt; of the Polish population held a higher education degree. In 2008, this percentage was 17,4.&lt;ref&gt;Renata Siemienska, Dominika Walczak. "Polish higher education. From state toward market. From elite to mass education." ''As the World Turns: Implications of Global Shifts in Higher Education for Theory, Research and Practice''. Edited by Walter Allen. Emerald Group Publishing. 2012. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[Bologna declaration]] on education in Poland made the diploma supplement mandatory for all diplomas in Poland. Polish universities then pushed for the [[European Credit Transfer System]] which was a quality assessment and accreditation program. There had been no official national system of credit transfer and accumulation in Poland previously. Therefore; a credit-point system was introduced for particular specialization.

The promotion of mobility had the goal to reach 10 percent. The obstacle in student mobility are differences in the organization of the academic year in European countries. The number of students coming to Poland is about 10 times lower than other countries and the need for other European languages was evident. Warsaw had 300 students in English and at the Technical University of Lodz there were 500 students in
English and French.&lt;ref&gt;Filipkowski, A. (2003). The Implementation of the Bologna Declaration in Poland. European Journal of Engineering Education. 28(2). pp 237-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European co-operation in quality assurance, Poland is trying to solve the problem of quality and accreditation in a highly professional way. The process of accreditation of study programs at Polish higher education institutions has been significantly accelerated. There are two forms of accreditiation, a state-controlled and academic community-owned one. For Poland, belonging to the European family is very important they do not want to be disseminated in Poland. For them, lifelong learning and promoting the European higher education area is their primary concern, they also believe that the European higher education area is best promoted by following the Bologna Declaration priorities and does not need any further comments.

==Public versus private==
Third Republic of Poland concentrated on the opening of new universities in the major cities. Poland started setting up vocational and pedagogical schools and university branch campuses. Private universities and colleges became more easily accessible to young people from the country and from working-class families than were the public higher educational institutions. The location is one of the most important criteria in choosing a university this is due to costs for travel and room and board often exceed the costs of tuition at a private university located close to a student's place of residence.

Education in Poland is one of the few sectors that was not restructured after the ending of the communist era. The systems in use for managing public universities and colleges vary substantially from those used in the private sector. The costs of instruction in public universities and colleges are higher than those in private institutions. The globalization of public life and the perspective of Polish membership in the European Union are pushing Polish graduates to choose to work abroad. It is inevitable that children from poor families and from small villages have practically no possibilities to enter admission competition and to take entrance examinations. Private higher education institutions, located close to the homes of such candidates, are more easily accessible to them.

Poland has been at the forefront of the development of the private higher education sector. Private educational institutions provide education to students for a fee; not for profit and usually invest their financial surplus in the development of themselves and their facilities.

Private higher education institutions are devoid of the burden of collective management. Their decisions are made by the rector or presidents. The senate and the faculty council are entirely advisory bodies which confer the academic degrees. Private institutions can respond rapidly to the changing needs of educational demand and labour market needs.

The majority of private higher educational institutions offer 3 year courses of study for a bachelor's degree. Only about twelve institutions offer a 5-year course of study which leads to a master's degree and only one has obtained the right to confer the doctorate degree. There are now 12 private institutions that occupy top positions relating to the standards of tertiary education which are published every year by many
institutions.

Private higher education institutions are decidedly more expensive for students than are the public.  Private institutions are more flexible and definitely offer higher quality services than do their public counterparts {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The public institutions are taking note and are taking measures to reduce these proportions. Nearly 100% of private institutions are funded from tuition fees and not from the state budget. They are dependent on their markets.

The effects of globalization and education are enormous. Education used to be regarded as a non-tradable service however; private provision of education is huge business in many nations. The technological developments like the Internet and cheaper telecommunications combined with increased acceptance on non-traditional educational settings (remote learning) may well broaden the scope of international trade in education services in the coming years and at this point has created the potential for fast growth.

Globalization has heightened the demand for education, which has also increased many private higher education institutions however; globalization may also lead to an erosion of national regulatory frameworks for education. In a globalized environment where businesses and workers find themselves operating more often in foreign environments, the national character of educational frameworks will potentially cause problems.

By 2010 Poland is hoping that the number of people enrolled in higher education should rise 35-40% and 40-45% in 2020. These increases will raise new challenges for higher education in regards to its accessibility, particularly for the inhabitants of villages and small towns. Ideally Poland wants to decrease the differences in the level of civilization between the country regions and the various social groups. With the spreading effects of the metropolises, the situating of universities and colleges in the medium-sized cities offers a chance to establish education centers of high quality and the possibility of creating innovative processes. The large well-equipped private higher education institutions with increasingly stable staffs are expected to prosper.

The ultimate goal for private institutions is to have official recognition of university status. The majority of institutions educating such specialists will be forced to diversify their offerings, which are bound to increase their costs. Higher education in Poland is trailing many European countries. They need to adapt to the changing labour market which will generate a larger demand for postgraduate, supplementary and retraining studies. By doing this it will increase the role of higher education in the fostering of regional development; the creation of regional innovation networks and a cultural atmosphere.

It is not easy to maintain the national traditions, habits and historical experience and at the same time fulfill common European priorities. The private higher education institutions are not as well treated as public institutions. Only the large national universities can guarantee high-quality education, while private schools require special supervision.

'''The Institute for Management Information Systems''' is a [[research institution]] of the Department of Information Systems and Operations, at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)]]. The WU is the largest university having a business and economics focus in Europe. The master's program "Information Systems" provided by the department is ranked 4th by "The Eduniversal Best Masters Ranking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-masters.com/ranking-master-information-systems-management/western-europe/wu-vienna-university-of-economics-business-master-in-information-systems.html |title=Ranked N°4 - Master in Information Systems - WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business) |publisher=Best-masters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319123309/http://www.best-masters.com/ranking-master-information-systems-management/western-europe/wu-vienna-university-of-economics-business-master-in-information-systems.html |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Western Europe.

== History ==
The institute was founded by Univ.Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Hans Robert Hansen in 1978 who chaired it for over 30 years. In early days, the development of industry oriented reference models for [[E-commerce|electronic commerce]] was the research and teaching emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wu.ac.at/ec/faculty/hansen |title=Em. ord. Univ.Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Hans Robert Hansen - Institute for Management Information Systems |publisher=WU |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219022312/http://www.wu.ac.at/ec/faculty/hansen |archivedate=2012-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Univ. Prof. Dr. Sarah Spiekermann has taken over the chair of the institute. Up to the present, the research focus is on ethical computing, privacy issues in the [[information society]], as well as context-aware systems and [[ubiquitous computing]].

== Research ==
The research mission of the institute is to design and investigate technologies that enhance social compatibility and long-term market success. The social compatibility of IT systems references the ability of IT systems to support basic human values and rights. These values and rights include privacy, security, autonomy, system control and calmness. Together with industry partners and international political institutions, the institute develops technical policies and procedures to ensure that designers consider these rights and values when they develop systems. The institute's conceptual and technical work is informed and supported by the analysis of economic conditions, which are given in the form of international markets for personal information, a trend towards automation, decision delegation as well as Internet economics. Furthermore, social and psychological dimensions of IT usage and acceptance are considered. Taken together, the institute follows a three-dimensional research approach, allowing for and using technical, economic and social methods of analysis. A wide range of methods to contribute to the development of a "sustainable" technology landscape is applied. The institute is a think tank for business and society that focuses on the sustainable design of information technology.  As a think tank, it contributes its work to international policy-relevant processes.

== Teaching ==

=== Bachelor's program ===
In the common body of knowledge, the institute offers two introductory courses to Management Information Systems. First, Business information systems 1 (BIS 1) is dealing with the fundamentals of business informatics. Second, Business information systems 2 (BIS 2) puts an emphasis on modelling business processes with software tools such as [[ARIS Express|ARIS]].

The specialization "Management Information Systems" serves the need of second- and third-year students. After an introduction to the basics of every-day computing, data structures of the semantic web and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems (e.g., [[Microsoft Dynamics]]) are discussed. In the following, students can specialize in E-Commerce or easily usable business programming tools.
The following courses are covered in the specialization.

*Foundations of ICT
*ERP Systems
*B-2-B E-Commerce
*E-Government
*Business Programming 1
*B-2-C E-Commerce
*Business Programming 2
*Ski seminar (winter)
*IT consulting
*Privacy and security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wu.ac.at/ec/courses |title=Courses - Institute for Management Information Systems |publisher=WU |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620175236/http://www.wu.ac.at/ec/courses |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master's program ===
In the master’s program "Information Systems" the institute's goal is the training of IT managers rather than informing the IT - knowledgeable economist. These executives, who will also be responsible for the implementation of new information systems, shall be educated to promote sustainable system development. In the master's common body of knowledge, the institute  offers a training in user-centered system design. Building on these foundations, the competence field "Sustainable IT" carries the institute's research activities into the classroom. In turn, students in the competence field's core seminars "Ethical Computing" and "Privacy and Security" give impulses for the research questions raised.

== Publications ==
The institute has contributed 881 publications to the community by June 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bach.wu-wien.ac.at/bachapp/cgi-bin/fides/fides.aspx/fides.aspx?search=true;wuorg=true;show=pub;tid=3818;lang=DE |title=FIDES (Forschungs-Information-Dokumentation-Evaluation) |publisher=Bach.wu-wien.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Intergovernmental Bureau for Informatics''' (IBI) originated as a transformation of the '''International Computation Centre''' (ICC) that was created by [[UNESCO]] in 1951 by Resolution 2.24 of the General Conference, implementing the mandate of Resolutions 22(III) of October 3, 1946, 160(VII) of August 10, 1948, 318(XI) of August 14, 1950 and 394(XIII) of the UN's ECOSOC .

==History==

The ICC's objective was to implement a Computation Centre that would serve the international [[scientific community]]. This was at a time when it was thought that only a few [[Computer|computation machines]] would become available and moreover they were very costly. The IBI started its activities in 1961 and it was soon overwhelmed by the speed of technological developments to the point that in 1969 it was about to become defunct due to a lack of content. Given this situation the transformation of the IBI was started. This transformation was directed by its Argentinean General Manager at the time, Professor Fermin A. Bernasconi.

==Member countries==

IBI membership peaked in 1985 with 43 member countries, of which three were developed countries, [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] and also its largest contributors. The rest were developing or underdeveloped countries.  In 1985, France withdrew its membership from IBI and by the end of 1986 Spain also withdrew. This was the start of a crisis within the IBI which led to the dissolution of this organisation in 1969. The archives of the IBI were deposited at the UNESCO. The member countries of the IBI at the time when it had the most members were the following: 
[[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Benin]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]] (formerly the Republic of Upper Volta), [[Cameroon]], Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali,  Morocco, Mexico, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Sao Tomé and Principe, Senegal, Spain, Syria, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Zaire.

==Objectives==

IBI-ICC was the only inter-governmental organization whose objective was to assist its member countries, in a permanent way, in the area of Information Technology. Its aim was to help them to better understand the impact of technology on society and to take the best advantage of these opportunities. IBI collaborated and helped its member countries to formulate strategies and policies to develop this area.

With these objectives, the ICC organized the first International symposium on Economics of Automatic Data Processing in October 1965, held in [[Amsterdam]], ([[The Netherlands]]). IBI-ICC organized a second international symposium in 1974, on the Economics of Informatics held in [[Mainz]], ([[Germany]]) in September. In October 1972 IBI-ICC organized the first World Conference on Informatics in Government in [[Florence]], ([[Italy]]).

==Conferences and Symposiums==
From 1975 onward IBI-ICC intensified its activities in the area of the development of governmental policies and strategies for informatics. The objectives of IBI-ICC was, therefore, to help member countries to establish policies for the development of Informatics in their societies. In November 1975  it organized  an international symposium on "National Planning for Informatics in Developing Countries" in Baghdad (Iraq). Some 500 participants from 53 countries attended. 

From 1976 onward IBI-ICC organized a series of workshops on the study of policies and strategies in informatics that were held in [[Punta Ala]] and in [[Venice]], (Italy).  These workshops ended with the  Strategies and Policies International Conference (SPIN) in Informatics. The SPIN Conference was organized by the IBI-ICC and the UNESCO with the support of the Spanish Government and took place in September 1978 in [[Torremolinos]], (Spain) with the participation of 86 countries, among them the "big powers", the USA and the USSR.

Other issues addressed by the IBI-ICC related to trans-border data flows especially of the protection of personal information. To this end  the first International Conference on Transborder Data Flows was organized in [[Rome]] (Italy) in September 1980 followed by a second held in 1984, also in Rome (Italy). Both conferences saw a large participation from countries and experts.

Within this context of Policies and Strategies for Informatics, the IBI-ICC also organized regional conferences. In Latin-America it organized the Latin-American Conferences for Information Managers (CALAI) held in Argentina (1970), in Mexico (1972), in Argentina (1979), in Mexico (1980), in Chile (1981), in Brazil (1982), in Uruguay (1983), in Mexico (1984), in Argentina (1985 and 1987). Subsequently these conferences were pt on by other organizations. 

In Africa IBI-ICC organized the first African Conference on Informatics in Abidjan (Ivory Coast) in 1979, followed by a second held in Dakar (Senegal) in 1983. IBI-ICC also sponsored the first SEARCC Conference held in Singapore in 1976.

==Informatics training==

IBI-ICC was also very interested in the training in informatics. It created several regional centres for training in informatics. The CREI (the Regional Centre for the Teaching of Informatics) was opened in Madrid (Spain) in 1976, in collaboration with the Spanish Government and its activities continued until 1997. The CREALC was set up in the Federal District of Mexico in 1981 and another centre in Dakar (Senegal) in 1983. IBI-ICC also had a large fellowship program for training of students from developing member countries in developed countries. In 1983, IBI-ICC, with the Argentinean government, created a foundation in Argentina for starting what would be later called the ESLAI (Latin-American school for informatics), providing it with initial funding.

==Other activities==

Within [[Latin America]] IBI-ICC organized two major events in 1984. in April it participated in the Round Table on "Informatics: a means of development or dependence for Latin America" put on by X CALAI-Panel 84 in Viña del mar (Chile). The proceedings were later published by IBI-ICC. In May 1984, in collaboration with the government of President [[Belisario Betancourt]] of [[Colombia]], IBI-ICC organized "Informatics and Soveignty", strategies for regional integration, held in Cali (Colombia) from the 10th to the 12th and which gave birth to the formation of the Cali Club. The final report was also published by IBI-ICC.

The IBI also dealt with other areas of informatics and its applications to the industrial sector, for which it created a research centre in Valencia (Spain) together with the Spanish government, the IBIDI.

Additionally it organized international symposiums to examine the relationship between informatics and the press in the "Presinfo" symposium held in Valencia (Spain) in October 1984 and the "Sisyphus" symposium also held in Valencia (Spain) in May 1986 which dealt with the change from the Industrial to the Information Society.

The IBI promoted technical assistance for cooperation with its member countries by sending experts to develop national informatics plans as was done in [[Chile]] in 1976 or [[Iraq]] in 1977 and for the drafting of contracts for the public procurement of equipment and computer services as in Iraq and [[Tunisia]].

In the mid 70s the IBI encouraged the development of Informatics Laws, publishing many studies on the relationship between law and informatics in various sectors of the society. Moreovover it participated in and collaborated on conferences on this subject.

In the early 80s the IBI-ICC collaborated on efforts to standardize the use of the Arabic language in informatics. In order to achieve this it organized and financed a committee, the COARIN, for the adaptation of Arabic written characters to the [[ASCII]] code which, at that time, proved very difficult.

==Publications==

Among the publications put out by the IBI is the AGORA magazine published between 1981 and 1986 with 15 editions dedicated to subjects on informatics in a changing world.

==Dissolution of IBI==

The IBI was the only international body to disappear from the League of Nations, raising a serious concerns. A UNESCO document stated that, before the departure of France and Spain from IBI, the budget of the agency had dwindled to half. The other major contribution came from Italy and therefore, officially, this was the cause of the dissolution.

Former officials, however, allude to other reasons. Some say it was as a result of a crackdown by corporations, mostly American and the U.S. government itself, who would have put pressure on the governments of Spain and Italy as a result of the fall in equipment sales to developing countries and because of the projects in Nicaragua and Cuba for which the U.S. government threatened commercial reprisals in Brazil between 1986-1988.

The '''International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC''' or sometimes '''IM&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C)''' is an international [[mathematical modeling competition]] for high school students in team [[mathematical model]]ing co-sponsored by COMAP&lt;ref name="COMAP"&gt;[http://www.comap.com/ COMAP]&lt;/ref&gt; and the NeoUnion ESC Organization.&lt;ref name="NeoUnion"&gt;[http://www.neounion.net/ NeoUnion ESC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICIAM"&gt;[http://www.iciam2015.cn/MS-Fr-D-67.html International Conference on Industrial and Applied Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt; Teams are selected on a country-by-country basis, with each country sending its top two teams to the competition. The IMMC was inspired by the HiMCM, a similar contest sponsored by COMAP but mainly attracting teams within the United States.&lt;ref name="HiMCM"&gt;[http://www.himcm.org/ HiMCM]&lt;/ref&gt; The HiMCM in turn was established in the 1990s to create a high school counterpart to COMAP’s [[Mathematical Contest in Modeling|MCM]].&lt;ref name="IMMC Origins"&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/immchallenge/photos/pb.1746968815530398.-2207520000.1444424370./1747227858837827/?type=3&amp;theater IMMC PowerPoint Posted on IMM Challenge Official Facebook Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rbr/files/bmtc-5-30-slides.pdf|title = Harvard University -- A Placement Problem|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mathmodels.org/contests.html|title = Mathematical Modeling Contests|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants in the IMMC are given five days to research (the contest permits the use of any inanimate source) and write a mathematical paper detailing their mathematical model for a given situation.&lt;ref name="IMMC Rules"&gt;[http://www.immchallenge.org/Pages/Rules.html IMMC International Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the five-day period, papers are sent to an international expert committee composed of mathematics faculty from the world’s leading universities. Traditionally, 3-4 teams are awarded the top designation of Outstanding and invited to an awards ceremony, held in a different country each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utdanacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/teaching_matters_umln_2-10-15.pdf|title = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics -- Teaching Matters!|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team selection==
Each participating country is expected to choose its two best teams of four contestants each to compete in the IMMC. Globally, different methods have been used to select teams from their respective countries.

Hong Kong holds the contest early and allows any interested team to participate.&lt;ref name="CUMCM"&gt;[http://www.mcm.edu.cn/html_cn/node/4a8cd11cda4e98ed825dffa50e5bc7b3.html China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM)]&lt;/ref&gt; A national judging panel selects the two best papers to move on to the international round of the competition. In 2015, 60 papers came out of the Greater China region alone.&lt;ref name="Greater China Teams"&gt;[http://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/CAM/cam-digest-html/15/v15n15.html Hong Kong Polytechnic University - CAM Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the United States used a different qualification process, inviting the top two teams from the 2014 HiMCM to compete in the IMMC. In 2016, the United States adopted a hybrid of Hong Kong’s approach and its own former approach: any team receiving a score of Meritorious or higher in the 2015 HiMCM (roughly 25% of competing teams) was invited to compete in the 2016 IMMC. As in Hong Kong, the United States held the IMMC early, completed a national round of judging, and selected the two best papers to move on to the international round.&lt;ref name="USA Rules"&gt;[http://immchallenge.org/Pages/Rules/USA/USA-Rules.html IMMC USA Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries use a selection process similar to that used by Hong Kong, and countries entering the IMMC for the first time will also likely adopt a similar process.&lt;ref name="UUIMMC"&gt;[http://www.fisme.science.uu.nl/wiki/index.php/International_Mathematical_Modeling_Challenge University of Utrecht -- International Mathematical Modeling Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mathschool.ru/page/224.html|title = Математическая школа -- Международный конкурс "Математическое моделирование"|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==

Papers passing the national selection round move on to the international expert judging panel. In 2015, the Expert Panel included:&lt;ref name="International Expert Panel"&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/immchallenge/photos/pb.1746968815530398.-2207520000.1444424370./1747227965504483/?type=3&amp;theater IMMC PowerPoint Posted on IMM Challenge Official Facebook Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards ceremony==

The 2015 IMMC winning teams from the USA, Singapore, and China were brought to Hong Kong for the IMMC Award Presentation Ceremony on 5 July 2015 at [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong University]], sponsored by Guangdong Qtone Education Co., Knowledge Magazine, [[Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers]], Competition on System Modeling &amp; Optimization (COSMO), CUHK, HKACE, and the Hong Kong Entrepreneurs and Executives Club.

Special guests included Hong Kong political leader the [[Fanny Law|Honorable Mrs. Fanny Law]] and movie directors Mr [[Tsui Siu-Ming]] and Mr Tang Yat-Ming.&lt;ref name="Sky Post"&gt;[http://www.skypost.hk/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E9%A0%AD%E6%A2%9D/20150706/001/%E8%A8%88%E5%87%BA%E6%8B%8D%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1%E6%9C%80%E7%9F%AD%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%20%E6%B8%AF%E7%94%9F%E5%A5%AA%E7%8D%8E/183278 Sky Post]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Frederick Leung, Chairman of the Board of Faculty, Faculty of Education, University of Hong Kong, gave the opening speech.&lt;ref name="HKCD"&gt;[http://www.hkcd.com.hk/pdf/201507/0706/HZ14706CLBA.pdf Hong Kong Commercial Daily]&lt;/ref&gt; Law encouraged educators in Hong Kong and elsewhere to continue to pursue the type of educational innovation promoted by the IMMC. Given that the 2015 problem revolved around mathematically modeling a movie filming production schedule, directors Tsui and Tang discussed their own experiences in the movie industry and how applicable teams’ models were to real-world movie filming decisionmaking.&lt;ref name="IMMC Awards Ceremony 2015"&gt;[http://immchallenge.org/Contests/2015/video/index.html IMMC Awards Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HKEJ"&gt;[http://www1.hkej.com/dailynews/views/article/1090860 Hong Kong Economic Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 IMMC winning teams from the USA and Hong Kong, in addition to the Meritorious German team, were brought to Hamburg, Germany for the IMMC Award Ceremony on 26 July 2016 at the [[University of Hamburg]] as part of the quadrennial [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]]. Dr. Sol Garfunkel described how the contest has evolved and discussed plans for the future.

'''[[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|d|uː|_|ˌ|k|r|ɪ|ʃ|n|ə|ˈ|m|ɜːr|t|i}} or {{IPAc-en|-|ˈ|m|ʊər|t|i}}; 11 May 1895&amp;nbsp;– 17 February 1986) was a philosopher, educationist, speaker and writer. His supporters{{spaced ndash}}working through non-profit foundations in India, Great Britain and the United States{{spaced ndash}}oversee several independent schools based on his views on education. They continue to transcribe and distribute his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and writings by use of a variety of media formats and languages.

== Krishnamurti Education Philosophy ==

Education forms a central core of Krishnamurti’s world view. In fact, Krishnamurti spent his entire life talking about education as being the agent not only of inner renewal but also of social change. Krishnamurti asserted that the schools functioning under the auspices of the Krishnamurti Foundation India (KFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kfionline.org/education-centres/|title=Education Centres|work=Krishnamurti Foundation India|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and others started independently by his supporters, did not exist as organizations for the indoctrination of children, but rather as places ‘where students and teachers can flower, and where a future generation can be prepared because schools are meant for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://waldenspath.com/jiddu-krishnamurti/|title=Jiddu Krishnamurti {{!}} Walden's Path School|work=Walden's Path School|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti supporters founded several schools around the world. When asked, Krishnamurti enumerated the following as his educational aims:
# ''Global outlook'': A vision of the whole as distinct from the part; there should never be a [[sectarian]] outlook, but always a holistic outlook free from all prejudice.
# ''Concern for man and the environment'': Humanity is part of nature, and if nature is not cared for, it will [[boomerang]] on man. Only the right education and deep affection between people everywhere will resolve many problems including the environmental challenges.
# ''Religious spirit, which includes the scientific temper'': The religious mind is alone, not lonely. It is in communion with people and nature.&lt;ref&gt;See ''As The River Joins The Ocean: Reflections about J. Krishnamurti'', by Giddu Narayan, Edwin House Publishing 1999, p 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education Bill sought to regulate appointments and conditions of teachers. Salaries of teachers were to be paid through the treasury. There was a provision of takeover of management of educational institutions, which arguably violated the constitution.&lt;ref name="SCR-Das"&gt;''In the premises, they may, in our opinion, legitimately complain that so far as the grants under Art. 337 are concerned, the provisions of the clauses of the Bill mentioned in question 2 do in substance and effect infringe their fundamental rights under Art. 30(1) and are to that extent void.'' Paragraph 44 ''But no rule to be framed under clause 36(2)(c) can nullify the constitutional infirmity of clause 3(5) read with clause 20 which is calculated to infringe the fundamental rights of minority communities in respect of recognised schools to be established after the commencement of the said Bill.''

The ministry for '''Sport, Arts and Recreation''' is a department in the Zimbabwean government which is responsible for the operation of sports and development of the arts within the country. The position was created by President [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]] following his cabinet formation in December 2017 when he split [[Ministry_of_Higher_Education, Science_and_Technology_(Zimbabwe)|Higher Education]] and [[Ministry_of_Primary_and_Secondary_Education_(Zimbabwe)|Primary and Secondary Eucation]] into two separate government agencies, the latter being responsible for sports and the arts prior to this move. 

The minister is former Olympic swimmer and record holder [[Kirsty Coventry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">The '''{{Lang|fr|Méthode pour la guitare}}''' is a method for the [[classical guitar]] originally written in French by guitarist and composer [[Fernando Sor]].

The method was written with the early romantic guitar in mind (Sor mentions some 19th-century guitar-builders: J. Panormo, Schroeder of Petersburg, Alonso of Madrid, Pages and Benitez of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, Rada, and Lacôte of Paris), but it is not only about instrumental technique, but also includes details about the theory of [[Scale (music)|scales]], [[harmony]], [[wiktionary:sonority|sonority]], composition, and above all music as an art.

==French and German edition==

[[File:Sor Methode.png|thumb|''Méthode pour la guitare'']]
The first edition was in French and appeared in Paris in 1830 with the title of ''{{lang|fr|Méthode pour la guitare par Ferdinand Sor}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/3276952 ''Méthode pour la guitare par Ferdinand Sor'' (1830)], [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jeffery (the modern publisher of A. Merrick's old English translation) mentions: "It is the only version known to have Sor's direct authority. Now extremely rare, it was never reprinted; indeed, an early biographer of Sor (Baltasar Saldoni in his ''Diccionario de Efemérides de Músicos Españoles'', I, Madrid, 1868) says (he does not state on what authority) that Sor destroyed the plates."&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt; During the same period [[Nikolaus Simrock|Simrock]] in Bonn had brought out a parallel French and German edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0788.pdf ''Méthode pour la guitare = Guitarre-Schule''] (Bonn: [[Nikolaus Simrock|N. Simrock]], 1831)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English edition==

The English edition is a translation from the original in French made by A. Merrick, the organist of [[Cirencester]], and published in London by Cocks &amp; Co. probably in 1832, as ''Method for the Spanish Guitar''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/3275624 ''Method for the Spanish Guitar''], [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French and German versions do not carry the word "Spanish" in the title. This version is today available from Brian Jeffery's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecla.com/catalog/0389.htm Fernando Sor – ''Method for the Spanish Guitar'' (1832)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211504/http://www.tecla.com/catalog/0389.htm |date=2010-04-07 }}, Tecla Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Jeffery mentions: "Later in the century, in 1897, Frank Mott Harrison published in London a ''Method for the Guitar'' by Ferdinando Sor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muslib.se/ebibliotek/boije/pdf/Boije%201140.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a work of small value which says (of course wrongly) that the original was written in Spanish."&lt;ref name="jeff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecla.com/extras/0001/0389/0389pref.htm|title=Sor: Method for the Spanish Guitar – preface to the Tecla edition | author = Brian Jeffery | publisher=Tecla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coste's adapted and augmented version==

After Sor's death, [[Napoléon Coste]], one of his pupils, published a revision of the original called ''{{lang|fr|Méthode complète pour la Guitare par Ferdinand Sor, rédigée et augmentée de nombreux exemples et leçons par N. Coste}}''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0789.pdf [http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0790.pdf alt.]&lt;/ref&gt; Matanya Ophee states that in Coste's revised and augmented version, there is an introduction which is helpful in better understanding Sor, and some of the circumstances under which Sor wrote the original method.&lt;ref name="ophee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarandluteissues.com/methods/methods.htm|title=A Brief History of Spanish Guitar Methods | author = Matanya Ophee | publisher=Éditions Orphée}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Jeffery controversially regards Coste's version somewhat negatively ("travesty of the original ... bears little resemblance to the original"),&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt; even though the title immediately makes it clear, that it is not the original, but was adapted and augmented by Coste (augmented incidentally, with numerous pieces of high quality). Today Coste's version is highly regarded in its own right (the title mentioning of Sor, possibly being more a sign of respect, than what Jeffery has termed "a disservice to his friend's memory"). Ophee has written: "He [Coste] is certainly not hostile to Sor and to his memory".&lt;ref name="ophee" /&gt;

==Various details==
In the method (in plate VII, example 27), Sor quotes bars 22 to 25 of Sonata Op. 35, No. 1 by [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]]; mentioning "that the celebrated Düssek had the texture of the orchestra in view when he wrote for the pianoforte the passage in example twenty-seventh, plate VII."

[[File:Kobunsyokan.jpg|thumb|275 px|The National Archives of Japan, located in the [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda ward]] in central [[Tokyo]].]]
The {{nihongo|'''National Archives of Japan'''|独立行政法人国立公文書館|''Dokuritsu Gyosei Hojin Kokuritsu Kōbunshokan''}} preserve Japanese government documents and historical records and make them available to the public.  Although Japan's reverence for its unique [[History of Japan|history]] and [[Japanese art|art]] is well documented and illustrated by collections of art and documents, there is almost no archivist tradition.  Before the creation of the National Archives, there was a scarcity of available public documents which preserve "grey-area" records, such as internal sources to show a process which informs the formation of a specific policy or the proceedings of various committee meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Nakayama, Shigeru ''et al.'' (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QfJuGVbQkFYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=archive+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ITo6bgql1motYWmY-J33ivOo1Wg ''A Social History of Science and Technology in Contemporary Japan: The Occupation Period, 1945-1952,'' p. 18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the National Archives Law No.79 (1999),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/national_archives.html  National Archives Law.]&lt;/ref&gt; the core function of preserving "government documents and records of importance as historical materials"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/public_archives.html  Public Archives Law.]&lt;/ref&gt; includes all material relating to (1) decision-making on important items of national policies, and (2) processes of deliberation, discussion, or consultation prior to reaching any decision-making, and the process of enforcing policies based on decisions made. The transfer of what are deemed historically important materials from the various ministries and agencies is carried out on a regular basis in accordance with the Transfer Plan prepared and revised by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] for each fiscal year.  Preservation, restoration cataloging, microfilming and digitization are all important aspects of the archive's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="functions"&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/pdf/source_04.pdf  Functions of the National Archives of Japan.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National Archives is in the process of becoming something more than simply a historical repository, because it is also a complex of structures, processes, and [[epistemology|epistemologies]] which are situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.&lt;ref name="blouin1"&gt;Blouin, Francis X. ''et al.'' (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hol1kuIcvK8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=archive+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR7,M1  ''Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory: Essays from the Sawyer Seminar,'' p. vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the [[Meiji Period]] (1868–1912), administrative documents had been preserved respectively by each government ministry. A library for the cabinet of the early Meiji government was established in 1873; and in 1885, this became the Cabinet Library (''Naikaku Bunko''), which evolved as the nation's leading specialized library of ancient Japanese and Chinese classical books and materials. The Cabinet Library's collection included government records of the [[Edo period]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1867) and other material. These collections are an important element of the archive's core holdings.&lt;ref name="functions"/&gt;

In November 1959, the President of the [[Science Council of Japan]] issued a recommendation establishing a National Archives to prevent scattering and loss of official documents and to facilitate public access. In July 1971, the newly created Archives began receiving, assessing, and cataloging government documents and records of importance as historical materials; and also, the Archives focused on the conceptually distinct program designed to encourage wider interest by mounting exhibitions and fostering research.&lt;ref name="functions"/&gt;

In July 1998, the Tsukuba Annex (''Tsukuba Gakuen Toshiwas'') was established in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] in order to expand and improve the storage of archival materials.&lt;ref name="functions"/&gt;

A Cabinet resolution in 1999 led to the creation of the {{nihongo|[[Japan Center for Asian Historical Records]]|アジア歴史資料センター|''Asia Rekishi Shiryo Centre''}}, which opened in November 2001. The center [[digitizing|digitizes]] data from various national institutions, such as the National Archives, [http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/hq/record/index.html  Diplomatic Record Office] of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041209033919/http://www.nids.go.jp/english/index.html  Military Archives] of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041209033919/http://www.nids.go.jp/english/index.html  National Institute for Defense Studies] of the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Japan Defense Agency]], and provides the digital data through the Internet.&lt;ref name="functions"/&gt;

===Independent Administrative Institution===
The National Archives became an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] on April 1, 2001, when an Act amending part of the National Archives Law came into effect. Archival responsibilities include managing public access to stored records,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/pdf/source_01.pdf  Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs]&lt;/ref&gt; and overseeing the collection as it grows and develops&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/pdf/source_04.pdf  Management of Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials.]&lt;/ref&gt; and preservation protocols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/pdf/source_03.pdf  Implementation of Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The enhanced independence of the archives was designed to help further its institutional focus on measures for the proper conservation of historical materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/basic_laws/pdf/source_02.pdf   Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-line access==
The National Archives website provides information about the archives and catalog data which allow the holdings to be searched online. The site offers English and Japanese versions, the holdings themselves are, of course, mainly in Japanese. The website facilitates access to brief descriptions and some images of documents, books, and cultural properties.  The Digital Gallery may be searched using keywords or various categories, opening access to digitised images of scrolls; maps; photographs; drawings; posters; and documents. English summaries of publications from the National Archives (journal and annual report) are available for downloading from the site.&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Intute: [http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=humbul15527  National Archives of Japan.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2005, the digital archive system in this website has provided high-resolution pictures of a range of holdings, including the materials designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/abouts/message.html   Mitsuoki Kikuchi, Greetings from the President.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collections in the National Archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and the state; and the archives are integral in a process of defining memory institutionally within Japan's prevailing political systems and cultural norms.&lt;ref name="blouin1"/&gt;

The National Archives has evolved as a model for developing prefectural and municipal archival collections—some of which predate the establishment of the national institution.  In these smaller institutions, similar activities of preservation, restoration, cataloging, microfilming and digitization are evolving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.go.jp/english/links/index.html Prefectural and municipal archives.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the Digital Gallery includes digitized photos of the stack room for official documents in Shiga Prefecture in 1924. These images were appended to a report submitted by the prefectural governor to the chief of the cabinet secretariat in November of that year.  Shiga's governor was describing the progress of work intended to modernize standards and procedures for compiling and storing of written records, which was expected to produce improved efficiencies in administrative services.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Gallery: [http://jpimg.digital.archives.go.jp/jpg_prg/jgmWeb?%TmpFileDisp%env=jpeg2k_images/photo/bosatsuko/kaika_e.env Photos of the stack room for documents and records in Shiga Prefecture, descriptive comment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220115644/http://jpimg.digital.archives.go.jp/jpg_prg/jgmWeb?%25TmpFileDisp%25Env=jpeg2k_images%2Fphoto%2Fbosatsuko%2Fkaika_e.env |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7904">The '''National Association of Schools of Music''' ('''NASM''') is an association of post-secondary [[music school]]s in the United States and the principal U.S. [[educational accreditation|accreditor]] for [[higher education]] in music.  It was founded on October 20, 1924, and is based in Reston, [[Virginia]]. Accreditation commenced in 1939.

== Accreditation ==
NASM is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] as a programmatic accreditation organization for institutions offering degree and non-degree educational programs in music and music-related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923101401/http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp |date=2014-09-23 }}, Council for Higher Education Accreditation, accessed December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/2009_2010_Directory_of_CHEA_Recognized_Organizations.pdf 2009-2010 Directory of CHEA-Recognized Organizations], Council for Higher Education Accreditation, accessed December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has approximately 625 accredited institutional members, including specialty schools of music, conservatories, and universities offering music programs.

== History ==
Leaders from six music schools met on June 10, 1924, to organize the inaugural convention of the "National Association of Schools of Music and Allied Arts" to be held on October 20, 1924, in Pittsburgh.  The founding leaders were:

# Burnet Corwin Tuthill (1888–1982), [[Cincinnati Conservatory of Music]]
# [[John James Hattstaedt]] (1851–1931), [[American Conservatory of Music]] (1886–1991)
# Kenneth McPherson Bradley (1872–1954), [[Bush Conservatory of Music]], which merged in 1932 with [[The Chicago Conservatory College]] under duress of the [[Great Depression]]
# Arthur Wright Mason (1866–1955), Louisville Conservatory of Music, which merged in 1932 with the [[University of Louisville]] under duress of the [[Great Depression]]
# Charles Newell Boyd (1875–1937), Pittsburgh Musical Institute, which merged in 1963 with the [[University of Pittsburgh]]
# [[Edwin John Stringham]] (1890–1974), Wolcott Conservatory of Music, founded in 1920 and in 1925 was reorganized and renamed as the Denver College of Music

The attendees at the first NASM Convention of October 20, 1924, decided to officially form the "National Association of Schools of Music and Allied Arts."  The accreditation aspect of NASM, though, did not launch until about 1929.  The charter members currently in existence are:

* [[The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts]]
* [[Cleveland Institute of Music]]
* [[Converse College]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]
* [[Eastman School of Music]], [[University of Rochester]]
* [[New England Conservatory of Music]], Boston
* [[Northwestern University]], [[Evanston, Illinois]]
* [[Oberlin College]]

* [[University of Oregon]]
* [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[Stockton, California]]
* [[University of Southern California]]
* [[Wisconsin Conservatory of Music]], [[Milwaukee]]
* [[Yale University]]

NASM's founding officers were Kenneth M. Bradley, President; Burnet C. Tuthill, Secretary; and Charles N. Boyd, Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', Nov. 16, 1924, "Organize National Music Association", retrieved from ProQuest Historical Newspapers Los Angeles Times (1881-1986), pg.

The '''New Iceland Heritage Museum''' located in [[Gimli, Manitoba]] is dedicated to preserving  the history and artifacts of the large population from [[Iceland]] who migrated to the Interlake region of Manitoba and now referred to as [[New Iceland]].

The museum is located in three sites:

*'''Waterfront Centre''' has a multi-media display of the history and artifacts of the immigrants.
*'''[[Lake Winnipeg]] Visitors Centre''' has a 500-gallon aquarium with species of fish from the lake and history and artifacts of early fishing.
*'''Gimli Public School 1915''' has an original classroom and artifacts used by the [[Huldufólk]] (hidden folk) from Iceland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10448">The '''Orton-Gillingham''' Approach to [[Reading (activity)|reading]] instruction was developed in the early-20th century.

It is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, [[cognitive]], and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;The structured flexibility of Orton-GillinghamBB Sheffield - Annals of Dyslexia, 1991 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential [[phonics]]-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn&amp;mdash;visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

== Orton and Gillingham ==

[[Samuel Orton|Samuel Torrey Orton]] (1879&amp;ndash;1948), a neuropsychiatrist and [[pathologist]] at [[Columbia University]], brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with [[dyslexia]] and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.

[[Anna Gillingham]] (1878&amp;ndash;1963) was an [[educator]] and [[psychologist]] at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]].  Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.

== Features of the Approach ==

'''Language-based''': The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.

'''Multisensory''': Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.
The use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple "triggers" for memory.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Gordon. Can Neuroscience Help to Demystify Dyslexia?  Schwab Learning. Retrieved from http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.aspx?r=430 October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured, Sequential, and Cumulative''': The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order.  Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], blends, and [[diphthongs]]&amp;mdash;in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.

'''Cognitive''': Students learn about the history of the [[English language]] and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.

'''Flexible''': Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.

== Research support ==
In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, "Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langengerg, Ph.D|first1=Daniel|title=Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/documents/report.pdf|website=National Reading Panel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=S.|title=The Orton-Gillingham Language Approach - A Research Review|date=10 February 2014|page=7|url=http://www.nessy.com/us/files/2014/06/Orton-Gillingham_Report-Final-Version.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of  studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from [[classroom]] use of OG methods with first graders, and use in [[special education]] or [[resource room]] settings with older children with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Ritchey2006&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Reichsanstalt für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht''' (English: Reich Institute for Film and Images in Science and the Classroom), before 1940 known as the '''Reichsstelle für den Unterrichtsfilm''' (English: Reich Office for Teaching Films) was a branch of the [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture]] which was charged with the creation of [[educational films]] during the [[Third Reich]]. The office was founded on June 26, 1934 and was headed by [[Kurt Gauger]].

By 1944 the Reichsanstalt had produced some 900 films; over 270 of them were for schools, the rest were for research and teaching purposes at universities. A total of more than half a million film copies were delivered. How many of these films were actually used, is unclear. The office also served as a lender for teaching media such as films and light pictures as well as for demonstration devices. In 1943, there were 36 provincial authorities and 1243 administrative centers in the occupied territories. It also edited a series of media pedagogical writings and from 1935 to 1943 also the magazine ''Film und Bild in Wissenschaft, Bildung und Volksbildung''.

On Feb. 6, 1935 a "Abteilung Hochschule" - university division - was established within the Reichsstelle, and in 1936 it absorbed the [[Deutschen Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Filme]]. In December 1945, the [[Institut für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht]] (FWU) was founded immediately after the capture of the inventory by US soldiers as a successor organization. The breakdown in district areas has been maintained.

'''Richard Worthington Smithells''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|DCH|MRCP|FRCP|FRCOG|FRCPCH}} (4 July 1924 – 13 June 2002) was a British [[Pediatrics|paediatrician]] and Emeritus professor of paediatrics at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref name="leeds"&gt;{{cite web |title=People of Achievement, Richard W Smithells (1924 - 2002) |url=http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/info/299/history_of_the_school/365/people_of_achievement/11 |website=Faculty of Health, School of Medicine |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithells was most notable for research into [[neural tube defect]]s, [[Birth defect|congenital abnormality]] registers, [[genetic counselling]], and [[rubella]] in pregnancy and for later suggesting direct examination of the foetus by photography using [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasonography]].&lt;ref name="rcp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Richard Worthington Smithells|url=https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/about-us/our-team/professor-richard-worthington-smithells|website=The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|publisher=The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=28 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munk"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Worthington Smithells|journal=Munks Roll – Lives of the Fellows|date=21 August 2013|volume=XI |url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5112|page=532|accessdate=21 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052049/http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5112|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Smithells great uncle and grandfather had been professors of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Leeds]] and his father was a Leeds graduate, so Smithells family always had a strong connection to the university. Smithells took his early education at [[Rugby School]] and later studied medicine at [[King's College London GKT School of Medical Education|St. Thomas' Hospital Medical School]].&lt;ref name="boult"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=PS |first1=Boulter |title=Richard Worthington Smithells |journal=British Medical Journal |date=24 August 2002 |volume=325 |issue=7361 |page=445 |issn=0959-8138 |pmc=1123961}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by 2 years of [[national service]] with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in Germany in 1949-1951.&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Professor Richard Worthington Smithells: Archives |url=http://archives.wellcome.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28AltRefNo%3D%27PP%2FSML%27%29AND%28Level%3D%27collection%27%29%29 |website=Wellcome Library |publisher=Wellcome Trust |accessdate=5 June 2018 |location=6872d729-7088-47f6-ae3d-e54bf6f095c6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 he married Joy Muriel Foster née Beaver, who died 4th February 2010. They had five children and eleven grand-children.&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt;

Smithells died on 13 June 2002 from [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name="boult"/&gt;

==Career==
After two years as a [[senior registrar]] at [[Guy’s Hospital]]&lt;ref name="munk"/&gt;, in 1959, Smithells became a lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]] and became consultant paediatrician and medical superintendent for [[Alder Hey Children's Hospital]] in 1964. In 1968 he took up the chair of Paediatrics and Child Health at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]], and worked in all the hospitals in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name="leeds"/&gt; By 1962, Smithells had established congenital abnormality register and genetic counselling service at the University of Liverpool.&lt;ref name="adc"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Archive of Disease in Childhood - Professor Richard W Smithells |journal=Journal of the Paediatric Association |date=1992 |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=1061–1062 |doi=10.1136/adc.67.9.1061 |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/67/9/1061.full.pdf |accessdate=5 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smithells retired from the chair of Paediatrics and Child Health in 1988.&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt; After his retirement, he continued to work. From 1989 to 1997 Smithells was appointed a medical consultant in [[vaccine damage tribunals]] that were established in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tribunals and Inquiries (Vaccine Damage Tribunals) Order 1979 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1979/659/resources |website=UK Government Legislation |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide [[Vaccine Damage Payment|payments]] to children seen to be damaged by a [[vaccine]].&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt; Further appointments included a position as a consultant on the [[European Registration of Congenital Abnormalities and Twins]] registry.&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt;  From 1994 to 1996 he also employed as part-time Director of the [[International Centre for Birth Defects]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="welcome"/&gt;

==Contributions==
Dick Smithells work during his long career was the prevention of disease in children.&lt;ref name="leeds"/&gt; Early in his career, Smithells recognized the effects of poor nutrition in pregnant women and how it led to [[birth defect]]s with studies taking many years. Indeed his most notable research in his career, was the establishing link between [[folic acid]] deficiency and [[neural tube]] defects. It wasn't until 1991 that the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] ratified his decision by recommending that pregnant women's diets should contain sufficient folic acid.&lt;ref name="munk"/&gt;

Many of Smithells early papers were about the effects of [[Thalidomide]] on the foetus,&lt;ref name="adc"/&gt; and he developed a special unit to support children damaged by thalidomide,&lt;ref name="boult"/&gt; and was later heavily involved in securing compensation for children disabled by the 
thalidomide drug, and taking a position in the Thalidomide Trust to facilitate that role.&lt;ref name="munk"/&gt;

'''''Roald Amundsen''''' (often abbreviated '''''Roald'''''; named in honor of Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]), originally named '''''Vilm''''', is a German steel-ship built on the [[Elbe]] River in 1952. Having worked in different areas, she was refitted in 1992 to 1993 as a [[brig]] (two-masted [[square rig|square-rigged]] sailing ship) and now serves as a [[sail training]] ship. During summer, she usually operates in the [[Baltic Sea]], and usually embarks for journeys to farther destinations for winter, including several trans-Atlantic crossings.

== Description ==
''Roald Amundsen'' has a [[length overall]] of {{convert|49.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a length of hull of {{convert|40.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|38.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The vessel has a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. ''Roald''{{'}}s [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] reach a height of {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} and are rigged with 18 sails with a total area of {{convert|850.0|m2|abbr=on}}. The vessel has a [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of 480 tons and has a tonnage of {{GRT|298|disp=long}}.

''Roald Amundsen'' has an 8-cylinder Buckau-Wolff [[diesel engine]] rated at {{convert|220|kW|abbr=on}}. The vessel is equipped with two generators, one of {{convert|48|kW|abbr=on}}, the other of {{convert|53|kW|abbr=on}}. The ship can carry 180 tons of ballast. ''Roald Amundsen'' has crew of 17 with up to 31 trainees embarked.

== Ship history ==

The [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of the ship was built at the shipyard ''Roßlauer Werft'' on the Elbe River in [[Roßlau]], [[German Democratic Republic]], in 1952. Originally intended for fishing as a deep sea fishing [[lugger]], plans were changed before the completion of the ship, and she was then instead built as a type of [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]. The vessel was completed at the shipyard ''[[Peene-Werft]]'' in [[Wolgast]], Germany, on the Baltic Sea.

Named ''Vilm'', the ship was put to use for the [[National People's Army]] (NVA)&lt;!--or rather: Volksmarine?!--&gt;, first as a tanker and supply vessel, operating out of [[Peenemünde]] and crewed mainly by civilian seamen. Converted to a transporter for [[bilge]] water in the 1970s on the Peene-Werft, ''Vilm'' then made regular trips to the bases of the National People's Army to take the ships' bilge water to a centralized treatment facility. This service was discontinued at the end of 1988.

After not having been used for a year, ''Vilm'' was towed to [[Neustadt in Holstein]] and there at the navy base used as [[Barracks ship|living quarters]]. At the beginning of 1991, the ship was put up for sale by the [[Vebeg GmbH]], a corporation to sell federal property.

Detlev Löll and Hanns Temme purchased the ship at an auction and, with the help of some of the former crew, sailed the ship to [[Wolgast]] in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. In spring 1992, a complete overhaul began, in the course of which the ship received a new exterior [[keel]] and was refitted as a brig; the rig includes five square sails at each mast and includes lifting yards for the upper-three yards (upper main topsail, topgallant and royal) at each mast, lowering the center of gravity of the ship when sails are furled. The overhaul was subsidized by the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the [[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]] and formed part of the [[job creation program]] "Fridtjof Nansen" (led by the owner), which comprised the refitting of this ship as well as other sailing ships {{ship||Fridtjof Nansen|ship|2}} and  {{ship||Nobile|ship|2}}.

In 1993, the ship was put to its new use under the name of ''Roald Amundsen''. It was chartered by the newly founded sail training club ''LebenLernen auf Segelschiffen [[eingetragener Verein|e.V.]]'' (short: LLaS; German: learning to live on sailing ships). After a short intermezzo with another sail-training club, ''Segelschiff Fritjof Nansen e.V.'', in 1993, ''Roald Amundsen'' has since been chartered by the LLaS and used for sail training.

''Roald Amundsen'' now operates all year around as a sail training vessel with voyages lasting between one and three weeks. Her home port is [[Eckernförde]], a harbour city in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] near [[Kiel]] in northern Germany. Summer months are spent with voyages on the Baltic Sea from Denmark to Baltic countries or the North Sea. Winters are spent in warmer regions. ''Roald Amundsen'' has repeatedly crossed the Atlantic Ocean, bound for South American ports in [[Brazil]] and [[French Guiana]] (1998), for [[tall ship]]s events in North America (2000, 2010), and for the [[Caribbean]] (2001, 2011/12, 2012/13). Further destinations include [[Iceland]] (1995), England and Ireland (2006), the [[Mediterranean]] (2006/07, 2007/08), the [[Canary Islands]] (1995), and others. During her North American voyage in 2010, ''Roald Amundsen'' visited the [[Great Lakes]] and there met with the US brig {{USS|Niagara|1813|2}}; the two brigs formed an unofficial friendship, and as of 2013, ''Roald Amundsen'' still flies a flag of ''Niagara'' at some occasions such as the Tall Ship Parade at [[Kiel Week]]. Another friendship, based on their respective crews on board for Kiel Week, has been formed with the German wooden schooner ''[[Amphitrite (1887)|Amphitrite]]''; both ships have established a tradition of berthing next to each other during the event.

The ship has participated in the [[Tall Ships' Races]] and is rated as a Class A tall ship by [[Sail Training International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallshipsraces.com/vessels/vessel.asp?VesID=1868 Sail Training International: Roald Amundsen]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic Council of Victoria]] (ICV) which claims to represent 200,000 Muslims in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] stated that the Muslim community suffered mental health and other problems due to the suspicions to which it is subjected.

===United Kingdom===
In early 2015 the increasing adoption of safe spaces in UK universities aroused controversy due to accusations that they were used to stifle free speech and differing political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/06/safe-space-or-free-speech-crisis-debate-uk-universities|work=The Guardian|title=Safe space or free speech? The crisis around debate at UK universities|date=6 February 2015|first=Ian|last=Dunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, a member of the [[Edinburgh University Students' Association]] was subject to a vote on whether to be expelled from a meeting within a safe-space for violating rules about making gestures of disagreement; the vote went in her favour. She had waved her arms in disgust with a claim made against her by another speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Sebastian|title=Student 'violated university safe space rule... by raising her arm at a meeting'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/student-violated-university-safe-space-rule-by-raising-her-arm-at-a-meeting-a3218101.html|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] hit out at universities for implementing "safe space" policies amid concerns that self-censorship is curtailing freedom of speech on campuses. The Prime Minister said it was "quite extraordinary" for universities to ban the discussion of certain topics which could cause offence. She warned that stifling free speech could have a negative impact on Britain's economic and social success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United States===
In the United States the concept originated in the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], where it "implies a certain license to speak and act freely, form collective strength, and generate strategies for resistance...a means rather than an end and not only a physical space but also a space created by the coming together of women searching for community." The first safe spaces were [[gay bar]]s and [[consciousness raising]] groups.&lt;ref name="Kenney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenney|first=Moira Rachel|title=Mapping Gay L.A.: The Intersection of Place and Politics|date=2001|page=24|isbn=1-56639-884-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Gay &amp; Lesbian Urban Explorers (GLUE) developed a safe spaces program. During their events including [[diversity-training]] sessions and [[antihomophobia]] workshops, they passed out magnets with an inverted [[pink triangle]], "[[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]]'s...symbol", surrounded by a green circle to, "symbolize universal acceptance," and asked, "allies to display the magnets to show support for gay rights and to designate their work spaces free from homophobia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Nicole C.|title=Changing Corporate America from Inside Out: Lesbian and Gay Workplace Rights|date=2004|page=209|isbn=0-8166-3999-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advocates for Youth]] states on their website that a safe-space is "A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=607&amp;Itemid=177|title=Glossary|publisher=Advocates for Youth|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some people consider safe space culture as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and a mechanism for retreating from opinions which contrast with one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volanteonline.com/2016/09/38442/|title=Safe spaces disrupt the First Amendment|last=volanteonline|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these may be individuals or institutions which support a safe space for LGBT students and employees. They may offer or mandate staff training on diversity, include being a safe space in the organization's [[mission statement]], develop and post a value statement in the organization's office, online, or on printed documents, or, if part of a [[coalition]], encourage the coalition to include being a safe space in its mission and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=496&amp;Itemid=177|title=Tips and Strategies for Creating a Safe Space for GLBTQ Youth|publisher=Advocates for Youth|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of safe spaces has been criticized on the grounds that it stifles [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/safe-spaces-free-speech-university-prevent-no-platforming-academic-freedom|title=Safe spaces are not the only threat to free speech|date=16 September 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heatst.com/culture-wars/stephen-fry-campus-safe-spaces-are-stupid-and-infantile/|title=Stephen Fry: Campus Safe Spaces Are Stupid and Infantile|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiked"&gt;{{cite web|title=The tyranny of safe spaces|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/the-tyranny-of-safe-spaces/17933|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015, journalist [[Judith Shulevitz]] distinguished between meetings where participants mutually consent to provide a safe space, and attempts to make entire dormitories or student newspapers safe spaces. 

According to Shulevitz, the latter is a logical consequence of the former: "Once you designate some spaces as safe, you imply that the rest are unsafe. It follows that they should be made safer." She gave the example of a safe space at [[Brown University]], when libertarian [[Wendy McElroy]], who was known for criticizing the term "[[rape culture]]" was invited to give a speech: "The safe space ... was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In College and Hiding From Scary Ideas |first=Judith |last=Shulevitz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |department=Op-ed |date=March 21, 2015 |accessdate=December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, journalist [[Conor Friedersdorf]] criticized the use of outdoor safe spaces to block press coverage of student protests. According to Friedersdorf, such uses reverse the intent of safe spaces: "This behavior is a kind of safe-baiting: using intimidation or initiating physical aggression to violate someone's rights, then acting like your target is making you unsafe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Campus Activists Weaponize 'Safe Space'|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/how-campus-activists-are-weaponizing-the-safe-space/415080/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |department=Politics |date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, British actor and writer [[Stephen Fry]] criticized safe spaces and [[trigger warning]]s as infantilizing students and possibly eroding free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/stephen-fry-speaks-about-erosion-of-free-speech-on-student-campuses_uk_570bb53de4b07a35187c5a96|title=Stephen Fry Speaks About Erosion Of ‘Free Speech’ On Student Campuses In Controversial Rubin Report Interview|last=George|first=Bowden|date=11 April 2016|work=HuffPost|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Furedi]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and [[Candace Russell]] of ''[[HuffPost]]'' have similarly stated that safe spaces contribute to [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] surrounded by like minded people, insulating those inside said chambers from hostile or negative speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Furedi, Frank|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-furedi-safe-space-20170105-story.html|title=Campuses are breaking apart into 'safe spaces'|date=2017-01-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-27|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/candice-russell/safe-spaces-and-echo-cham_b_7043548.html|title=Safe Spaces and Echo Chambers, How Progressive Movements Stagnate Themselves| last=Russell|first=Candice|date=2015-04-13|website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other known speakers who have criticized the concept of safe spaces include [[Christina Hoff Sommers]]&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Tyler (October 14, 2016). [https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8258 "Safe spaces a 'recipe for fanaticism,' Hoff Sommers claims"]. Campus Reform.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Crowder]].&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Jason (April 26, 2016). [http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/04/26/comedian-steven-crowder-dishes-out-brutal-nearly-5-minute-reality-check-to-social-justice-warriors-when-they-interrupt-event/ "Comedian Steven Crowder Dishes Out Brutal, Nearly 5-Minute ‘Reality Check’ to ‘Social Justice Warriors’ When They Interrupt Event"]. ''[[TheBlaze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]'' reported in 2016 that safe spaces were considered by some to be re-[[racial segregation|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;Emily DeRuy[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/08/finding-the-line-between-safe-space-and-segregation/496289/ The Fine Line Between Safe Space and Segregation] The Atlantic, Aug 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
"[[Safe Space (South Park)|Safe Space]]", a 2015 episode of the animated comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', [[parodied]] the concept of safe-spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Caffrey, Dan (October 22, 2015). [http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/cake-metaphor-comes-back-another-solid-episode-sou-227304 "The cake metaphor comes back on another solid episode of ''South Park''"]. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The country duo of [[Chad Prather]] and [[Steve McGrew|Steve "Mudflap" McGrew]] turned the 1990 [[Garth Brooks]] song "[[Friends in Low Places]]" into "[[Friends in Safe Spaces]]", which parodied the practice.{{Cn|date=January 2018}}

'''TS ''Playfair''''' is a traditionally-rigged [[brigantine]] [[training ship]] operated by  [[Toronto Brigantine Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontobrigantine.org |title=Toronto Brigantine Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sail-training Canadian registered charity based in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. ''Playfair'' is used for a youth sail training program on the [[Great Lakes]] during the summer months. This program is one of the very few sail training programs where all of the crew except for the captain are in high school (13–19 years old). The summer training is followed by a winter program where youth work through higher levels of training syllabus to become accredited members of the crew the following year.

== History ==
''Playfair'' was constructed for Toronto Brigantine Inc. in 1973 as an addition to an already established sail training organization which began operation with the [[STV Pathfinder]] in 1962.

During the Royal Visit to Canada in 1973, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] christened ''Playfair'' at her launching in Kingston on Wednesday, June 27 with ''Pathfinder'' docked just astern; Prince Philip was in attendance.

She was commissioned by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, and remains the only Canadian ship to be commissioned by a reigning monarch. Although very similar to sister ships ''Pathfinder'' and [[St-Lawrence 2|''St. Lawrence II'']], there are several minor structural differences such as a wider transom and a slightly larger freeboard. Since 1974 ''Playfair'' has conducted sail training on the Great Lakes with occasional summer voyages down the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic, most recently in 2007 for Tall Ships Halifax.
[[File:Playfair Baie Fine.jpg|thumb|Playfair sailing in to Baie Fine in 2013]]

== Interior layout ==
''Playfair'' is divided into six watertight compartments from fore to aft the: Forepeak (general bosun stores, anchor chain bins); Petty Officer's Mess (sleeping space for 4 petty officers); Seamen's Mess (sleeping and living space for up to 18 trainees, also includes the galley); Engine Room (area for engine, generator and batteries); Wardroom (sleeping and living space for 6 wardroom officers, also includes the captain's cabin, a separate but not watertight compartment) and the Afterpeak (mooring line and fender storage and steering gear).

'''Tatiana Mikhailovna Riabouchinska''' ({{lang-ru|Татья́на Миха́йловна Рябуши́нская}}, Tatiana Mikhailovna Ryabushinskaya; 23 May 1917{{spaced ndash}}24 August 2000) was a [[Russian American]] [[prima ballerina]] and teacher. Famous at age 14 as one of the three "[[Baby Ballerinas]]" of the [[Original Ballet Russe|Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] in the 1930s, she matured into an artist whom critics called "the most unusual dancer of her generation."&lt;ref&gt;Vicente García-Márques, "Riabouchinska, Tatiana," in ''International Dictionary of Ballet'', edited by Martha Bremser (Detroit: St. James Press, 1990), vol. 2, pp. 1197–99. Includes a chronology of roles performed and an appraisal of her artistry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
She was born in [[Moscow]] a few months before the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Because her father was a banker to the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]], the whole family was put under house arrest by revolutionaries. But, with the help of their servants, her mother and the four children escaped and fled through the [[Caucasus]], arriving eventually in the south of France. A few years after they had settled in Paris, where there was a large Russian émigré community, Tatiana, known as Tania, began her ballet studies with Alexandre Volinine, who had trained at the [[Bolshoi Ballet Academy]] in Moscow. She also studied with [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], a friend of the family who had been ''prima ballerina assoluta'' of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Clarke, "Tatiana Riabouchinska," ''The Guardian'' (London), obituary (28 August 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Under Volinine's tutelage, the girl developed strength, elevation, and speed; under Kschessinska, quick footwork and lyrical ''port de bras''.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

At 14, Riabouchinska was chosen by Nikita Balieff to join his Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe, Le Théâtre de la Chauve-Souris (The Bat Theater), often billed simply as [[La Chauve-Souris]]. In the 1931 edition of their revue, which featured Russian songs, dances, and comedy numbers, she appeared in two short ballets, ''Diana Hunts the Stag'' and ''The Romantic Adventures of an Italian Ballerina and a Marquis''. In Paris, she was seen by choreographer and ballet master [[George Balanchine]], who quickly signed her for the [[Original Ballet Russe|Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], then being organized by Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]] and his associates. She joined that company after the American tour of La Chauve-Souris. She and two other young dancers in the company became known as the [[Baby Ballerinas]].&lt;ref name=Amanda&gt;Amanda. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/ballets-russes/2005/07/16/1121455937588.html "Ballets Russes"], ''[[The Age]]'' (17 July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1932, in her first season with the de Basil company, Riabouchinska created the role of the Child in [[Léonide Massine]]'s ''Jeux d'Enfants'' and in two works by Balanchine, ''La Concurrence'' and ''Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme''. Subsequently, she created roles in other Massine works, including the first three of his famous, and controversial, "symphonic" ballets: Frivolity in ''Les Présages'' (1933), set to [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Fifth Symphony]]; the third and fourth movements of ''Choreartium'' (1933), set to [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]]; and Reverie in ''Symphonie Fantastique'' (1936), by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]].

After [[Michel Fokine]] joined the company, he created the roles of the Golden Cockerel in ''Le Coq d'Or'' (1937), the title role of ''Cendrillon'' (1938), and the Florentine Beauty in ''Paganini'' (1939) especially for her. Besides these roles, she danced in many other ballets in the company repertory. For ''Les Sylphides'', perhaps Fokine's most famous work, she was coached by the choreographer himself. Her dancing of the Prelude, with exquisite pointework, soft little jumps, feathery landings, and liquid arm movements, became legendary, and she retained the role throughout her career.

Riabouchinska also created many roles in ballets choreographed by [[David Lichine]], a principal dancer in the de Basil company, who made a second career as a choreographer. Besides leading roles in ''Nocturne'' (1933) and ''Les Imaginaires'' (1934), she embodied the Chief Spirit in ''Le Pavillon'' (1936), the Angelic Apparition in ''Francesca da Rimini'' (1937), the Flower Girl in ''Le Lion Amoureux'' (1937), and the Romantic Girl in ''[[Graduation Ball]]'' (1940), a joyous characterization that became another of her signature roles.&lt;ref&gt;Kathrine Sorley Walker, ''De Basil's Ballets Russes'' (London: Hutchinson, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Riabouchinska remained with the de Basil company, which was finally renamed as the [[Original Ballet Russe]], until 1942. The conflict of World War II disrupted its normal operations, and the company had to stop touring in Europe.

She married David Lichine in 1943, and the two of them embarked on a joint career as free agents, dancing and choreographing for many companies in the United States, England, France, and Argentina. They had one daughter, Tanica Lichine.

In the United States, Riabouchinska also appeared on Broadway in an unsuccessful operetta entitled ''Polonaise'' (1945), choreographed by Lichine to music of [[Frédéric Chopin]]. She appeared in a Hollywood film, ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946), in which she and Lichine danced his choreography in the "Two Silhouettes" sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Billman, ''Film Choreographers and Dance Directors'' (Jefferson, N.C.: MacFarland, 1997), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their years of dancing together, they were one of the ballet world's most admired and beloved couples.

==Later years==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In 1953, the Lichines retired to Los Angeles, where they devoted their energies to their dance academy in Beverly Hills. They also founded and directed several small performing groups. After David Lichine died in 1972, Riabouchinska continued to teach for many years, counting a number of Hollywood celebrities among her students.

In the late 1990s, she was filmed teaching class in her studio and reminiscing about her years with the de Basil company. This footage, along with many archival film clips of her performances with the company, is included in the documentary film ''[[Ballets Russes (documentary)|Ballets Russes]]'' (2005), a Goldfine/Geller production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">The '''Theremin Center for Electroacoustic Music''' was created in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] in 1992 by the group of musicians and computer scientists, under the leadership of Andrey Smirnov. It was named for [[Leon Theremin]] - Russian inventor of the [[Theremin]], one of the first widely used electronic musical instruments.

The Theremin Center aims to achieve a co-operation of musicians, artists, scientists, and technologists who are oriented toward realization of experimental artistic projects. The centre is envisioned as a base from which to carry out interdisciplinary research in such fields as [[computer music]], [[electroacoustic music]], [[interactive]] systems, [[multimedia]], including [[dance]], [[visual arts]] etc., as well as a centre for the development and creation of innovative programs, technical devices and techniques. 

From the start the Theremin Center was intended to operate on a non-profit basis and most services and equipment were donated by the founders and sponsors of the Theremin Center. Professor [[Jon Appleton]] founded the International Advisory Board and helped in developing the Theremin Center and establishing continuous relationships within the international musical and scientific communities. The [[Moscow State Conservatory]] has provided space. It was a part of the Sound Recording and Musical Acoustics Laboratory - the place where in the 1960s [[Leon Theremin]] was conducting his research. Since 2005, the Theremin Center has been a part of the Electroacoustic Center at Moscow State Conservatory.

'''Unity High School''', founded in 1928, but with roots going back to 1902, is an independent school in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], which uses the English language and provides a British-style education to children from 4 to 18 years of age. In 2005, it had an enrollment of some 750 pupils. It had Mrs Stephanie King as a vice principal from the year 2008 onwards, the director of the School was Mr Robert Boulos and the principal was Richard Woods. Unity High is situated in the centre of Khartoum.

==History==
The school was found in 1902 as an all-girls school and was originally called the Unity High School for Girls.&lt;ref name = 1948History&gt;Wheeler, Jack, Editor (1949) [http://unitykhartoum.blogspot.be/2010/10/unity-high-school-for-girls-khartoum.html Unity High School for Girls Khartoum 1928-1949] Retrieved 19 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   In the preceding years, the [[Copt]]ic community in Khartoum had established a boys' school but lacked the resources to found a girls' school. Some Coptic families then approached the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] missionary [[Llwellyn Gwynne]] (who later became Bishop of Khartoum) for help and the Coptic Girls School was opened in 1902 but changed its name to the Church Missionary Society Khartoum Girls School in 1903.&lt;ref name = Durham&gt;[http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/sad/unityhs.xml Unity High School, Khartoum] Durham University Library Special Collections Catalogue, Reference code: GB-0033- SAD, 1902-1991, Retrieved 20 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 the Church Missionary Society school closed and the land reverted to Bishop Gwynne who with the support of four local Christian communities&lt;ref name = 1948History/&gt; and the financial help of Christian merchants, then opened the Unity High School for Girls.

Unity High School became co-educational in 1985.&lt;ref name = Durham/&gt;

==Teddy bear blasphemy case==

On 25 November 2007 the school came to international attention when one of its teachers was arrested by Sudanese authorities for allegedly insulting Islam by allowing the children in her class to name a [[teddy bear]] "[[Muhammad]]".&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news |title='Muhammad' teddy teacher arrested |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7112929.stm |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2007-11-26 |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|author=Rob Crilly in Khartoum and Lucy Bannerman |title=Sudan police throw teacher in jail for teddy bear named Muhammad|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article2951262.ece|work=[[The Times]]|date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2007-11-28|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/teddy-bear-teacher-found-guilty-article-1.255459|title=Teddy bear teacher found guilty|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''|accessdate=4 October 2012|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University Belt''' is the unofficial name of a [[de facto]] subdistrict in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It refers to the area where there is a high concentration or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city.

The University Belt is commonly understood as the one located, mainly, in [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]] district. But technically it also includes nearby [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], and [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]]. Generally, it includes the western end of [[España Boulevard]], Nicanor B. Reyes Street (formerly Morayta Street), the eastern end of [[Recto Avenue]] (formerly Azcarraga Street), [[Legarda Street]], [[Mendiola Street]], and the different side streets. Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other.

However, Manila also has other clusters of universities and colleges, such as the one found in the long stretch of [[Taft Avenue]] from [[Ermita]] through [[Malate, Manila|Malate]], although not as compact, and another one found inside the walled city of [[Intramuros]], although not as many as the one found in [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]].

Nevertheless, the three clusters are close enough together that many consider it as one huge University Belt. All are found within no more than four miles (six kilometers), in an irregular crescent string shape, across seven of the sixteen districts of Manila.
