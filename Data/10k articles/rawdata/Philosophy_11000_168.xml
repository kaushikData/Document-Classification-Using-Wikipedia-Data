'''Adverse authority''' or '''adverse controlling authority''', in [[United States]] [[law]], is some controlling authority based on a legal decision and opposed to the position of an attorney in a case before the  court. The attorney is under an ethical obligation to disclose that legal decision, which is an '''adverse authority''', to the court. This obligation is set forth in the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], §3.3.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. American Bar Association, ''Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct'' (2003), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basis for the disclosure requirement==
The obligation to disclose adverse authority is in tension with the attorney's obligation to zealously represent the interests of the client. However, various [[public policy]] arguments have been set forth to explain why the attorney's duty of candor to the court with respect to such authority outweighs the duty to the client's cause. Ostensibly, the reason is to serve the law itself by preventing a court from making a decision that is erroneous in light of the authority revealed.&lt;ref name="Law of Lawyering"&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, W. William Hodes, John S. Dzienkowski, ''The Law of Lawyering'' (2000), §29-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a practical matter, an attorney who discovers adverse authority and fails to disclose it to the court may lose credibility with the court if the authority is found by opposing counsel, or by the court itself. The court may presume that an attorney who fails to disclose such authority has either been unethical in failing to disclose it, or has acted without diligence in failing to discover it. Moreover, the attorney disclosing such authority has the opportunity to frame the disclosure in a manner that seeks to diminish the impact of that authority by presenting arguments as to why it is inapplicable to the facts of the current case, or should be overturned altogether.

==What must be disclosed==
In order to fall within the obligation for disclosure, the matter must meet three conditions: it must be legal authority, it must be directly adverse, and it must be from a controlling jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Law of Lawyering"/&gt;

;Legal authority:
The matter for which disclosure is compelled must be a matter of decided law, rather than a mere opinion rendered by an academic. For example, where an attorney is arguing that a certain transfer of assets should be permitted in a bankruptcy proceeding, that attorney need ''not'' disclose a [[law review]] article, [[casebook]], or [[op-ed]] piece in which the author argues that exactly such a transfer of assets should never be permitted. Such a writing need not be disclosed even if the author of the article is a leading expert on the area of law, and the article contains strong and well-written arguments in support of the position.

Conversely, adverse authority ''does'' extend to binding legal materials other than court decisions, including statutes, local ordinances, and decisions of administrative bodies having adjudicative authority.&lt;ref name="Law of Lawyering"/&gt;

;Directly adverse
The requirement that the authority be directly adverse has been a source of uncertainty. Attorneys are keen to distinguish adverse authority by finding sufficient differences in the facts of previous adverse cases to argue that the previous case does not apply to the current situation. Such argument essentially seeks to present the prior authority as not being adverse at all, because it applies to sufficiently different facts. In order to counter the tendency of attorney's to diminish the precedential value of adverse authority, such authority is weighed by an objective standard in determining whether it should be disclosed. The standard is whether the judge sitting on the case would consider the authority to be important, or if she would feel misled if the authority were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="Law of Lawyering"/&gt;

;Controlling jurisdiction
Adverse authority from another jurisdiction need not be disclosed. In state courts, that generally includes cases decided by courts of other states. In federal district courts, that generally includes cases decided by district courts in other federal districts, and by the federal courts of appeal other than the particular court of appeal that the district court falls under. State court decisions need not be reported to federal courts unless the federal court is deciding a matter that falls under state, rather than federal, law; decisions of federal courts other than the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] need not be reported to state courts.&lt;ref name="Law of Lawyering"/&gt;

[[Image:KhomyakovA AvtoportretABR.jpg|thumb|215px|Self-portrait (1842)]]
'''Aleksey Stepanovich Khomyakov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Степа́нович Хомяко́в}}) (May 13 ([[Old Style|O.S.]] May 1) 1804 in [[Moscow]] – October 5 (O.S. September 23), 1860 in Moscow) was a Russian theologian, philosopher, poet and amateur artist. He co-founded the [[Slavophile]] movement along with [[Ivan Kireyevsky]], and he became one of its most distinguished theoreticians. 
His son [[Nikolay Khomyakov]] was a speaker of the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]].

== Biography ==
Khomyakov's whole life was centred on Moscow. He viewed this "thousand-domed city" as the epitome of the Russian way of life. Equally successful as a landlord and conversationalist, he published very little during his lifetime. His writings, printed posthumously by his friends and disciples, exerted a profound influence on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and Russian lay philosophers, such as [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], and [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]. [[Alexander Herzen]]'s ''My Past and Thoughts'' contains a delightful characterisation of Khomyakov.

For Khomyakov, socialism and capitalism were equally repugnant offspring of Western decadence. The West failed to solve human spiritual problems, as it stressed competition at the expense of [[co-operation]]. In his own words, "Rome kept unity at the expense of freedom, while Protestants had freedom but lost unity".&lt;ref&gt;''History of Russian Philosophy'' by [[Nikolai Lossky]] {{ISBN|978-0-8236-8074-0}} p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomyakov's own ideals revolved around the term ''[[sobornost]]'', the [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] equivalent of ''[[catholicity]]'' found in the [[Nicene Creed]]; it can be loosely translated as "togetherness" or "symphony". Khomyakov viewed the Russian ''[[obshchina]]'' as a perfect example of sobornost and extolled the Russian peasants for their humility.

Khomyakov died from [[cholera]], infected by a peasant he had attempted to treat. He was buried next to his brother-in-law, [[Nikolai Yazykov]], and another disciple, [[Nikolai Gogol]], in the [[Danilov Monastery]]. The Soviets arranged for their disinterment and had them reburied at the new [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5394">'''Anselm Haverkamp''' (born July 18, 1943) is a  [[Germany|German]]-American professor of [[literature]] and [[philosophy]]. He received his academic education in [[Freiburg University|Freiburg/Brsg]], [[University of Zurich|Zurich]], [[Bonn University|Bonn]] and [[Konstanz university|Konstanz]]. After his PhD in [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and his Habilitation in the Konstanz School of Criticism, he moved from Konstanz to [[Yale]]; since 1989 he has taught as professor of English at [[New York University]], where he also founded the Poetics and Theory Program. Since 1994 he has served as founding member of the newly established [[European University Viadrina]] in [[Frankfurt an der Oder]], East of Berlin. In 2009, he was made an honorary professor of philosophy at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

Haverkamp was a member and co-editor of the research group Poetik und Hermeneutik in its later phase, 1979-1996. Under the influence of the Yale School of deconstruction ([[Paul de Man]], [[Jacques Derrida]]), he developed the Konstanz School's Rezeptionsästhetik ([[Wolfgang Iser]], [[Hans Robert Jauß]], Wolfgang Preisendanz) from a theory of literary response ([[Reader-response criticism]]) to a theory of literary latency.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Truestedt, „Anselm Haverkamp—Geschichte und Latenz“, in: Kultur: Theorien der Gegenwart, ed. Stephan Moebius, Dirk Quadflieg, 2. Aufl. Wiesbaden 2010. As well as Stefanie Diekmann and Thomas Khurana (Eds.), Latenz: 40 Annäherungen an einen Begriff, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relevant parts of this theory are the theory of [[metaphor]] or metaphorology, including the history of [[rhetoric]] and historical epistemology, as well as the relationship of philosophy and literature.

Main references of his work include the Poetics of [[Aristotle]], the Rhetoric of [[Quintilian]], the Aesthetics of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], as well as the work of [[Benjamin]] and [[Derrida]], [[Hans Blumenberg]] and [[Stanley Cavell]]. Relevant literary authors include [[Ovid]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Keats]], [[Hölderlin]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]] and [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]].

More recently, Haverkamp has extended the theory of latency into the fields of historical epistemology, [[art theory]] and [[legal studies]]. He is a regular contributor and editor of ''[[Texte zur Kunst]]'' (Berlin) und ''Law and Literature'' (Berkeley).

'''Archibald Arthur''' [[FRSE]] (6 September 1744 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1797) was a Scottish [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher. An alumnus of the [[University of Glasgow]], he served as University [[chaplain]] from 1774 &amp;ndash; 1794, and [[librarian]] from 1780 - 1794.  Between 1780 and 1794 he worked as an assistant to Professor of Moral Philosophy [[Thomas Reid]], taking on the latter's teaching duties, and succeeding him in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2041&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of Archibald Arthur|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Andrew Arthur, a considerable farmer, and was born at [[Abbot's Inch]], in [[Renfrewshire]] 6 September 1744. He entered the University of Glasgow in his thirteenth or fourteenth year, and in due course took his degree of M.A. Both before and after his appointment to a professorship he lectured with success in logic, botany, humanity, and church history. In October 1767, he received from the presbytery of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] his preacher's license, not, however, without some opposition on the ground of want of orthodoxy in the doctrines of the [[Church of Scotland]]. He was soon afterwards appointed chaplain to the University of Glasgow, and assistant minister with Dr. Craig of that city. He was also chosen librarian to the University, and held the office until nearly the close of his life.{{sfn|Tedder|1885|pp=131,132}}

For some years he was usefully employed in compiling a complete catalogue of the books, arranged in two parts, one under an alphabet of authors, and the other according to the position of the volumes on the shelves. The catalogue was printed in 1791, and described 20,000 volumes. It gave much satisfaction. Arthur was appointed assistant professor in moral philosophy through the influence of Dr. [[Thomas Reid]], who was obliged to give up his full professorial duties on account of increasing years. This took place in May 1780, and Arthur taught the class for fifteen years in return for part of the salary. On the death of Reid, he was elected full professor, but held the office only for one session, dying on 14 June 1797. He never married, and died worth a considerable sum of money, which he left to his brothers and sisters. They devoted part of it to the publication of his posthumous "Discourses on Theological and Literary Subjects",{{sfn|Tedder|1885|p=132}} which were edited, with a memoir by his friend [[William Richardson (classicist)|William Richardson]]. The theological discourses include one on the argument for the existence of God, another on the goodness of God, and others on objections to [[David Hume]], and similar topics; among the literary discourses are two upon theories of beauty, one on the arrangement of ancient and modern languages, and others on the study of ancient languages as a necessary branch of liberal education.  Arthur had a shy and hesitating manner, but possessed liberal opinions to which he always had the courage to hold firm. [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|A. F. Tytler]], in a note upon a letter of Dr. Reid, remarks: "Mr. Arthur, a man of learning, abilities, and worth, filled the chair of moral philosophy … with a reputation which did not disappoint the hopes of his respectable predecessor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tedder|1885|p=132}} cites: ''Life of Lord Kames,'' iii. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Discourses'' "give a very favourable idea of his talents, the justness of his taste, and the rectitude of his moral and religious principles".{{sfn|Tedder|1885|p=132}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4498">'''Breathwork''' is an [[umbrella term]] for various [[New Age]] practices in which the [[conscious]] control of breathing is meant to influence a person's mental, emotional and/or physical state, with a claimed therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal |title=Breathwork as a therapeutic modality: an overview for counselors |doi=10.1002/j.2161-007X.2010.tb00025.x |vauthors=Young JS, Cashwell CS, Giordano AL |journal=Counseling and Values |year=2010 |volume=55 |issue=1 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breathwork has no proven positive health impact other than promoting relaxation and can cause [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

==Description and sub-types==
Breathwork is a method of breath control that is meant  to give rise to altered states of consciousness and to have an effect on physical and mental well-being.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal |title=Breathwork as a therapeutic modality: an overview for counselors |doi=10.1002/j.2161-007X.2010.tb00025.x |vauthors=Young JS, Cashwell CS, Giordano AL |journal=Counseling and Values |year=2010 |volume=55 |issue=1 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from various spiritual and pre-scientific traditions from around the world, it was pioneered in the West by [[Wilhelm Reich]].&lt;ref name=young/&gt;

There are several sub-types of breathwork:

* '''[[Rebirthing-Breathwork]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; was devised by Leonard Orr in the 1970s. It is claimed to be capable of releasing suppressed traumatic childhood memories.&lt;ref name=radford&gt;{{cite journal |author=Radford B |authorlink=Benjamin Radford |title=New Age 'Rebirthing' Treatment Kills Girl |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=24 |issue=5 |year=2000 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vivation'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; was created by Jim Leonard and Phil Laut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breathe Easy Holistic program airs out stress-filled habitat |newspaper=Denver Post |date=7 February 1996 |page=G-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to improve wellbeing through the use of [[circular breathing]].&lt;ref name="MantleTiran2009"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Mantle F, Tiran D |work=A-Z of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A guide for health professionals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYvQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT108 |year=2009|publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-7020-4999-9 |pages=108 |title=Vivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Holotropic Breathwork''' (a trademark) is a practice that uses breathing and other elements to putatively allow access to non-ordinary states of consciousness. It was developed by [[Stanislav Grof]] as a successor to his [[LSD]]-based [[psychedelic therapy]], following the suppression of legal LSD use in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=Brant |title=Psychotherapy and Spirit: Theory and Practice in Transpersonal Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7XrDvWKyFAUC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Stanislav+Grof&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LlTsT_-ZCMa90QXf7YX6DA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stanislav%20Grof&amp;f=false|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791434664|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a 1993 report commissioned by the [[Scottish Charities Office]], concerns about the risk that the hyperventilation technique could cause seizure or lead to psychosis in vulnerable people caused the [[Findhorn Foundation]] to suspend its breathwork programme.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castro, ''Hypocrisy and Dissent within the Findhorn Foundation: Towards a Sociology of a New Age Community'' (New Media Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Other types'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There are many other types of Breathwork which have emerged over the last few decades, including Integrative Breathwork, Transformational Breathwork, Shamanic Breathwork, Conscious Connected Breathing, Radiance Breathwork, [[Zen Yoga]] Breathwork and many others.

==Effectiveness==
Breathwork has no verified beneficial effect on health, although there is some evidence it may help relaxation. However, some people find its effects distressing.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=72–74 |chapter=Breathwork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Buckminster''' "'''Bucky'''" '''Fuller''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|l|ər}}; July 12, 1895&amp;nbsp;– July 1, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9365050 |title=Fuller, R.

Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "[[Spaceship Earth]]", "[[Dymaxion]]" house/car, [[ephemeralization]], [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetic]], and "[[tensegrity]]". He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known [[geodesic dome]]. Carbon molecules known as [[fullerene]]s were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.

Fuller was the second World President of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] from 1974 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mensa: The Society for the Highly Intelligent |pages=299, 304 |first=Victor |last=Serebriakoff |publisher=Stein and Day |year=1986 |isbn=0-8128-3091-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:BuckminsterFuller cropped.jpg|right|thumb|220px|As a young man]]
Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of [[Margaret Fuller]], an American journalist, critic, and [[women's rights]] advocate associated with the American [[transcendentalism]] movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work|last=Sieden|first=Steven|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=0738203793|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller spent much of his youth on [[Bear Island (Maine)|Bear Island]], in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine. He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term "invention".

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.&lt;ref name=pawley&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=0-8008-1116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Fuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [[vaudeville]] troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his "irresponsibility and lack of interest." By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt;

===Wartime experience===
Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile [[factory|mill]], and later as a laborer in the [[meat-packing]] industry. He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a [[crash rescue boat]] commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt; in 1927.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p84-85"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden |title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work |location=New York |publisher=[[Perseus Books Group]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |pages=84–85 |quote=However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company. Within weeks Stockade Building Systems became a subsidiary of Celotex Corporation, whose primary motivation was akin to that of other conventional companies: making a profit. Celotex management took one look at Stockade's financial records and called for a complete overhaul of the company. The first casualty of the transition was Stockade's controversial president [Buckminster Fuller, who was fired].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression and epiphany===
Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from [[polio]] and [[spinal meningitis]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. Buckminster, ''Your Private Sky'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt; just before her fourth birthday.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller dwelled on her death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt; This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt;

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p87"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |page=87 |quote= ... during 1927, Bucky found himself unemployed with a new daughter to support as winter was approaching. With no steady income the Fuller family was living beyond its means and falling further and further into debt. Searching for solace and escape, Bucky continued drinking and carousing. He also tended to wander aimlessly through the Chicago streets pondering his situation. It was during one such walk that he ventured down to the shore of Lake Michigan on a particularly cold autumn evening and seriously contemplated swimming out until he was exhausted and ending his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

{{quote|From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p87-88"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/automobiles/collectibles/15BUCKY.html |title=Design – A Three-Wheel Dream That Died at Takeoff – Buckminster Fuller and the Dymaxion Car |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 15, 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt; Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's [[Chronofile]] archives, housed at [[Stanford University]]. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.&lt;ref name="2008-NYTimes-Fuller-Whitney-Museum-of-American-Art"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/arts/music/15ster.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller |publisher=The New York Times |first=James|last= Sterngold |date=June 15, 2008 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them ... finding ways of ''doing more with less'' to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} By 1928, Fuller was living in [[Greenwich Village]] and spending much of his time at the popular café [[Romany Marie]]'s,&lt;ref name="HaberGlueck"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author-link= John Haber |first=John |last= Haber |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]] ''Best of Friends'' exhibit (May 19, 2006 – October 15, 2006) |quote= [[Isamu Noguchi|Noguchi]], then twenty-five, had already had enough influences for a lifetime&amp;nbsp;— from birth in Los Angeles, to childhood in Japan and [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], to premedical classes at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], to academic sculpture on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], to [[Brancusi's circle]] in Paris. Now his exposure to [[American Modernism|Modernism and "the American century"]] received a decidedly New York influence.&lt;br/&gt; "Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around [[Dymaxion house|his first major design]], plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar." &lt;br/&gt; See also: {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/arts/design/19nogu.html |title= The Architect and the Sculptor: A Friendship of Ideas |first= Grace |last=Glueck |authorlink=Grace Glueck |newspaper=The New York Times |date= May 19, 2006 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and [[Eugene O'Neill]] several years earlier.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p74"&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden.

===Geodesic domes===
Fuller taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in [[North Carolina]] during the summers of 1948 and 1949,&lt;ref name="ExhibitBMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title=IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College, July 15 – November 26, 2005 |work=Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115004344/http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.

Fuller's first "continuous tension – discontinuous compression" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R. Buckminster |last2=Fuller |location=Garden City, N.Y. |publisher=Anchor Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-385-01804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.

===Dymaxion Chronofile===
[[File:Dynamaxion 1933.jpg|right|thumb|A 1933 Dymaxion prototype]] 
For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.

International recognition began with the success of huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at [[North Carolina State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.  [[Richard Lewontin]], a new faculty member in [[population genetics]] at [[North Carolina State University]], provided Fuller with computer calculations for the lengths of the domes' edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | author=Jerry Coyne and Steve Jones| title = 1994 Sewall Wright Award:  Richard C.

Fuller began working with architect [[Shoji Sadao]]&lt;ref name="wrsc.org"/&gt; in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large [[geodesic dome]] for the [[Montreal Biosphere|U.S. Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="wrsc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrsc.org/people/shoji-sadao |title=Shoji Sadao |work=World Resource Simulation Center |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This building is now the "[[Montreal Biosphère]]".
In 1962, the artist and searcher [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.

From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in Fuller's own words, devoted to "applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity." Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|SIU Edwardsville]], where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |title=The Center for Spirituality &amp; Sustainability |publisher=Siue.edu |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313014223/http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml# |archive-date=March 13, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of "omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity." Fuller referred to himself as "the property of universe" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work "the property of all humanity". For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.

===Honors===
Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=2007&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=2007&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007&amp;q=%22inventor%3A+richard+buckminster+fuller%22&amp;btnG=Search+Patents |title=Partial list of Fuller U.S. patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] from [[The Franklin Institute]]. Fuller was elected as an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year).&lt;ref name="PhiBetaKappa1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic576105.files/Harvard-elected-1966-81.pdf |title=Catalogue of Members: Harvard members elected from 1966-1981 |publisher=Harvard College Phi Beta Kappa |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckyFullerNowBio4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.buckyfullernow.com/sect-4-bio-of-buckminster-fuller-1947---1976.html|first=L.

===Death===
[[File:Bucky TRIMTAB.jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone (see [[Trim tab#Trim tab as a metaphor|trim tab]])]]
Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital&lt;!-- What was the name of this hospital? --&gt;, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: "She is squeezing my hand!" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Philosophy and worldview==
Buckminster Fuller was a Unitarian like his grandfather, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Arthur Buckminster Fuller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019224827/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-19 |title=Arthur Buckminster Fuller }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/buckminster-fuller-3/ |title=Buckminster Fuller: Designer of a New World, 1895-1983 |work=Harvard Square Library |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806065007/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/fuller.html |archivedate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early [[environmental activist]]. He was aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle that he termed "[[ephemeralization]]", which according to futurist and Fuller disciple [[Stewart Brand]], he coined to mean "doing more with less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brand |first=Stewart |title=The Clock of the Long Now |location=New York |publisher=Basic |year=1999 |isbn=0-465-04512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and waste from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]], a term which he used broadly as a metaphor for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term [[synergy]] became popular.{{Citation needed|reason=When did the term "synergy" become "popular"?|date=October 2016}}

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy]] and [[material efficiency]] in the fields of architecture, engineering and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

Fuller was concerned about [[sustainability]] and human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the "technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," his analysis of the condition of "Spaceship Earth" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: "selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable ... War is obsolete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fuller |first= R. Buckminster |pages= xxv |chapter= Introduction |title= Critical Path |edition= 1st |year= 1981 |location= New York, N.Y. |publisher= St.Martin's Press |isbn= 0-312-17488-8 |quote= "It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable as mandated by survival. War is obsolete. |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopia or oblivion: the prospects for humanity|last=Fuller|first=R.

Fuller was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s idea of [[general semantics]]. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the [[Institute of General Semantics]], and he delivered the annual [[Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Individuals Influenced by General Semantics|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/the-general-semantics-learning-center/overview-of-general-semantics/notable-individuals/|publisher=The Institute of General Semantics|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]]''. The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drake|first=Harold L.|title=The General Semantics and Science Fiction of Robert heinlein and A. E. Van Vogt|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/articles/gsb/gsb41-drake.pdf|work=General Semantics Bulletin 41|publisher=Institute of General Semantics|page=144|quote=For his dissertation showing some relationships between formulations of Alfred Korzybski and Buckminster Fuller, plus documenting meetings and associations of the two gentlemen, he was given the 1973 Irving J. Lee Award in General Semantics offered by the International Society for General Semantics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1970 book ''I Seem To Be a Verb'', he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe."

Fuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Amy, "A Fuller Explanation", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss&lt;/ref&gt;

He had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 "Dymaxion Award" for "poetically economic" domed living structures.

==Major design projects==
[[File:Géode V 3 1.gif|frame|A geodesic sphere]]

===The geodesic dome===
Fuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] – [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] for the [[Planetarium Jena|Zeiss-Planetarium]], built some 28 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), is the same design as Bauersfeld's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/geodome.htm |title=Geodesic Domes and Charts of the Heavens |publisher=Telacommunications.com |date=1973-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple "[[tensegrity]]" structures (tetrahedron, [[octahedron]], and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R.

The Dymaxion was not an automobile ''per se'', but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive &amp;mdash; an "Omni-Medium Transport" for air, land and water.&lt;ref name="Marks 1973 104"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling.  The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform,&lt;ref name="universe"/&gt; and Fuller noted the Dymaxion "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements."&lt;ref name="universe"/&gt;

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its [[Automobile platform|platform]] featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° [[steering|steering lock]]. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation,  bringing nearby traffic to a halt.&lt;ref name="Kleiner"&gt;{{cite web

  | quote = In 1934, Fuller had interested auto magnate Walter Chrysler in financing his Dymaxion car, a durable, three-wheeled, aerodynamic land vehicle modeled after an airplane fuselage. Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. "You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce," the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &amp;mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete.

===Housing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion house at [[The Henry Ford]]]]
Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion house]] garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term "Dymaxion" is used in effect to signify a "radically strong and light tensegrity structure". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened "bell" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325–344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design included a "Go-Ahead-With-Life Room" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel "through time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed {{convert|90|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A study of a prototype floating community|author=R. Buckminster Fuller|publisher=Triton Foundation|year=1968|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of the city aroused the interest of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] who, after leaving office, had them placed in the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971dec04-00080 |title=Cities on the Sea? |first=John |last=Lear |journal=The Saturday Review |volume=54 |date=December 4, 1971 |page=90 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

===Dymaxion map and World Game===
Fuller, along with co-cartographer [[Shoji Sadao]], also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players attempt to solve world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

==Appearance and style==
Buckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed [[spectacles]] to correct his extreme [[hyperopia]], a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VWF_6f0UCkYC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=farsighted+buckminster+fuller+zung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w8w5TmCBcz&amp;sig=i-DHjruCVOwKkpnPODfQoHhYvyE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS96KTlqbNAhWjxYMKHRK7C-sQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=farsighted%20buckminster%20fuller%20zung&amp;f=false Thomas T.

In public appearances, Fuller always wore dark-colored suits, appearing like "an alert little clergyman".&lt;ref name=Kenner-Guided-Tour /&gt;{{rp|18}} Previously, he had experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany, but found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas.&lt;ref name=Fuller-Maharishi-1971&gt;{{cite web |title=Buckminster Fuller and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Part One of Press Conference 1/3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z8u313eY_c |work=YouTube |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6:15}} Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one's credibility, and decided to become "the invisible man" by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself.&lt;ref name=Fuller-Maharishi-1971 /&gt;{{rp|6:15}} With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a "second-rate bank clerk".&lt;ref name=Fuller-Maharishi-1971 /&gt;{{rp|6:15}}

Writer [[Guy Davenport]] met him in 1965 and described him thus: "He's a dwarf, with a worker's hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with WORLD SERIES 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man's temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of [Robert] Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine. Blue blazer, Khrushchev trousers, and a briefcase full of Japanese-made wonderments; ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner'', ed. Edward M. Burns (Counterpoint, 2018), p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quirks==
Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|290}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |title=Annals of Innovation: Dymaxion Man: Reporting &amp; Essays |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fuller |first = Buckminster |title = [[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |publisher = Southern Illinois University Press |location = Carbondale |year = 1969 |isbn = 0-8093-2461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|290}}

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with [[polyphasic sleep]], which he called ''Dymaxion sleep''. Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats,&lt;ref name="Sieden-Universe"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sieden | first1 = Lloyd Steven | title = [[Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work]] | location = New York | publisher = [[Perseus Books Group]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 0-7382-0379-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenner | first1 = Hugh | title = [[Bucky: A Guided Tour of Buckminster Fuller]] | location = New York | publisher = [[William Morrow &amp; Company]] | date = 1973 | isbn = 0-688-00141-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} This allowed him "twenty-two thinking hours a day", which aided his work productivity.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|160}} Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits.&lt;ref name="Time-Magazine-1943-Dymaxion Sleep"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774680,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: Dymaxion Sleep | date=October 11, 1943 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II.&lt;ref name="Time-Magazine-1943-Dymaxion Sleep"/&gt;

Despite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as "tireless"&lt;ref name="Life-Magazine-1971-Farrell"&gt;{{Citation | last = Farrell | first = Barry | title = The View from the Year 2000 | newspaper = [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine | pages = 46–58 | date = 26 February 1971 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22fuller+is+a+man+of+exceedingly+gentle+manners%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9KbNVMrzHaG8mQXKuIKwBg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA | accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} by [[Barry Farrell]] in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island.&lt;ref name="Life-Magazine-1971-Farrell"/&gt;{{rp|55}} In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|160}}

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately {{convert|270|ft|m}} of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at [[Stanford]] University.

In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply "Bucky".

==Language and neologisms==
Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;"What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often "common sense" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense." Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled "What I Am Trying to Do." And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that "by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences."&lt;ref&gt;"How Little I Know" from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "down" and "up", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words "in" and "out" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going "outstairs" and "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

"World-around" is a term coined by Fuller to replace "worldwide". The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using "wide" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse", replacing "sunrise" and "sunset" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].

Fuller also invented the word "livingry," as opposed to weaponry (or "killingry"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. "The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry."&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term "[[tensegrity]]" from ''tensional integrity''. "Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder."&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Dymaxion]]" is a portmanteau of "'''dy'''namic '''max'''imum tens'''ion'''". It was invented about 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.&lt;ref&gt;''R. Buckminster Fuller – Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: "The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it."&lt;ref name="cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&amp;name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[allotropy|allotrope]] of [[carbon]], [[fullerene]]—and a particular molecule of that allotrope C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; ([[buckminsterfullerene]] or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry was given to [[Harry Kroto|Kroto]], [[Robert Curl|Curl]], and [[Richard Smalley|Smalley]] for their discovery of the fullerene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/index.html |title=Chemistry 1996 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is quoted in the lyric of "The Tower of Babble" in the musical ''[[Godspell]]'': "Man is a complex of patterns and processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusicals.com/lyrics/godspell/prologuetowerofbabble.htm |title=Godspell: Prologue / Tower of Babble Lyrics |work=allmusicals.com |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indie band [[Craig Benzine|Driftless Pony Club]] named their 2011 album, ''Buckminster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/driftless-pony-club/id16784455|title=Driftless Pony Club|publisher=Apple|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after him. All the songs within the album are based upon his life and works.

On July 12, 2004, the [[United States Post Office]] released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp's design replicated the January 10, 1964 cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

Fuller was the subject of two documentary films: ''[[The World of Buckminster Fuller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud]]'' (1996). Additionally, filmmaker [[Sam Green (filmmaker)|Sam Green]] and the band [[Yo La Tengo]] collaborated on a 2012 "live documentary" about Fuller, ''The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samgreen.to/the-love-song-of-r-buckminster-fuller/ The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] presented "Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe", the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819090507/http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp |date=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] in 2009. It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |title=Chicago's MCA to show ''Buckminster Fuller ~ Starting with the Universe'' |year=2009 |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407000421/http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Second Chance: for Your Money, Your Life and Our World'', Plata Publishing, LLC, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1612680460}}&lt;/ref&gt; is largely about Kiyosaki's interactions with Fuller, and Fuller's unusual final book ''Grunch of Giants''.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R.

In 2012, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] hosted "The Utopian Impulse" – a show about Buckminster Fuller's influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating "free energy" from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/903 "The Utopian Impulse,"] San Francisco Museum of Modern Art press release, retrieved April 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different note, Fuller's quote "Those who play with the Devil's toys, will be brought by degree to wield his sword" was used and referenced as the first display seen in the strategy sci-fi video game ''[[XCOM: Enemy Within]]'' developed by [[Firaxis Games]].

''[[The House of Tomorrow (2017 film)|The House of Tomorrow]]'', is a 2017 American independent drama film written and directed by [[Peter Livolsi]], based on [[Peter Bognanni]]'s 2010 novel of the same name, featuring [[Asa Butterfield]], [[Alex Wolff]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Maude Apatow]], and [[Ellen Burstyn]].  Burstyn's character is obsessed by all things Buckminster Fuller providing retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home, including authentic video of Buckminster Fuller talking and sailing with Ellen Burstyn, who'd actually befriended him in real life.

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones''' (19 February 1848 – 9 April 1922) known as Constance Jones or E.E. Constance Jones, was an English philosopher and educator. She worked in [[logic]] and [[ethics]].

==Life and career==
Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones was born at Langstone Court, [[Llangarren]], [[Herefordshire]] to John Jones and his wife, Emily, daughter of Thomas Oakley JP, of [[Monmouthshire]]. She was the eldest of ten children. Constance was mostly tutored at home. She spent her early teenage years with her family in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and when they returned to England in 1865 she attended a small school, Miss Robinson's, in Cheltenham, for a year.

She was coached for the entrance examination for [[Girton College, Cambridge]] by Miss Alice Grüner, a former student of [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] at her home in [[Sydenham]], Kent. She went up to Girton in 1875 where, prompted by having read [[Henry Fawcett]]'s ''Political Economy'' (1863) and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic|Logic]]'' (1843), she chose the Moral Sciences [[Tripos]]. However, she almost immediately had to withdraw in order to look after the aunt with whom she then lived. Her undergraduate career was considerably interrupted because the education of her younger brothers took precedence over her own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waithe|first=ME|title=A History of Women Philosophers|date=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=0792328086|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite this in 1880 she was awarded a first class in the Moral Sciences Tripos.

She returned to Girton in 1884 as a research student and a resident lecturer in Moral Sciences. Having studied with [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] and [[J.N. Keynes]], she completed the translation of [[Hermann Lotze|Lotze]]'s ''Mikrokosmus'' initiated by Elizabeth Hamilton. She also edited [[Henry Sidgwick]]'s ''[[Methods of Ethics]]'' (1901) and his ''Ethics of [[Thomas Hill Green|Green]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], and [[James Martineau|Martineau]]'' (1902); and wrote ''Elements of Logic'' (1890); ''A Primer of Logic'' (1905); ''A Primer of Ethics'' (1909); ''A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearing'' (1911); ''Girton College'' (1913). She was Mistress of [[Girton College, Cambridge]], from 1903 until her retirement in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warnock|first=Mary| authorlink = Mary Warnock, Baroness Warnock|title=‘Jones, (Emily Elizabeth) Constance (1848–1922)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48443|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was one of the first women to join the [[Aristotelian Society]] in 1892, serving on the Society's Executive Committee from 1914 to 1916. She was also the first woman recorded as having delivered a paper to the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club]]. She spoke about [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]]'s ''Naturalism and Agnosticism'' on 1 December 1899, with the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] chairing the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'': Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982, appendix. p. 116ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Her views were regarded as original and influenced her colleagues. She spent her career developing the idea that [[categorical proposition]]s are composed of a predicate and a subject related via identity or non-identity.&lt;ref name="WIWH"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Women in World History|Women in World History, Vol. 4: Cole-Dzer]]|year=1999|publisher=Yorkin Publications|location=Waterford, CT|isbn=0-7876-4063-8|pages=72–73|last=Hundleby|first=Catherine|chapter=Constance Jones, E.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Constance Jones' most significant contribution to philosophy was in logic and she was widely regarded to be an authority in this area by her contemporaries.&lt;ref name="WIWH"/&gt; Her major work is ''A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearings'' (Cambridge, 1911). She was chiefly concerned with the import and interpretation of [[propositions]]. [[G.F. Stout]] says of her: "She did good service in insisting on the distinction between interpretation from the point of view of the speaker and that of the hearer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stout|first=G.F.|title=The Late Miss E. E. Constance Jones|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|date=1922|volume=31|issue=123|page=383|jstor=2249490|doi=10.1093/mind/xxxi.123.383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her autobiography, Jones wrote of an early fascination with issues related to the nature and structure of content:
"This unsettled question—what is asserted when you make a statement, and what is the proper form of statement?—had deeply interested me from the time when I was a student and puzzled over Mill's and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]]' accounts of propositions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=E.E. Constance|title=As I Remember: An Autobiographical Ramble|date=1922|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|location=London|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jones published several textbooks on logic and numerous articles on logic and ethics, particularly on Sidgwick's ethical hedonism. However, despite her contribution to [[analytic philosophy]] she has become largely forgotten.

Since 1990 there has been intense debate among [[paleontologist]]s about the evolution in the Early [[Cambrian]] period of the "super-[[phylum]]" [[Lophotrochozoa]], which is thought to include the modern [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]] worms and [[brachiopod]]s, as well as their evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins".

==Organisms featured in the debate==

The name "halwaxiid" was formed by combining the names of two members of the proposed group, ''[[Halkieria]]'' and ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. The group was defined as a set of Early to Mid [[Cambrian]] animals that had: a "chain mail" coat of three [[concentric]] bands of small armor plates that are called [[sclerite]]s; in some cases, a small cap-like shell at the front end and in some cases both ends.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt; Some scientists are unhappy with this loose definition, arguing that such traits may have arisen [[convergent evolution|convergently]] rather being inherited from a common ancestor. This objection suggests that the group is not [[monophyletic]],&lt;ref name=ButterfieldPalAss&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words that the group does not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor. In fact the originators of the term "halwaxiid" prefer an evolutionary "family tree" in which the halwaxiids are not monophyletic.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

Other fossil organisms became involved in the debate as there were plausible arguments for considering them closely related to the halkieriids or ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' or both. One was the more recently discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which looked an intermediate between the halkieriids and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as it had a shell like that of halkieriids, and [[Biomineralization|unmineralized]] sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – in fact the article which first described ''Orthrozanclus'' introduced the term "halwaxiid".&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt; New finds of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'' put this animal into play as well since, despite its lack of sclerites or shells, its feeding apparatus looks very like ''Wiwaxia''’s.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006" /&gt; The [[Siphogonotuchida|siphogonotuchids]], a very Early Cambrian group known only from isolated sclerites among the [[small shelly fossils]], also appear in analyses as their sclerites suggest this group  may have been close to the ancestors of halkieriids.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Genera group=note&gt;The original, possibly incomplete, list includes ''[[Australohalkieria]], [[Drepanochites]], [[Eohalobia]], [[Halkieria]], [[Lomasulcachites]], [[Ninella]], [[Ocruranus]], [[Oikozetetes]], [[Orthrozanclus]], [[Sinosachites]], [[Siphogonuchites]], [[Thambetolepis]]'', and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' — {{cite journal

==Suggested phylogenies==
Since 1995 several [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or evolutionary "family trees", have been suggested for these organisms.

The most intense part of the debate centers round ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. Conway Morris (1985) originally dismissed the earliest classification of ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as a [[polychaete]] worm, because he thought there was little structural similarity between a polychaete's scale-like [[elytra]] and ''Wiwaxia''’s [[sclerite]]s, and because the arrangement of the sclerites, with quite different numbers in each band, showed no sign of the regular [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] that is a feature of polychaetes. Instead he thought ''Wiwaxia'' was very similar to shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, that it must have moved on a mollusc-like muscular foot, and that its feeding apparatus looked like a primitive form of the molluscan [[radula]], a tooth-bearing [[chitin]]ous "tongue". Hence he classified it as a "[[cladistics|sister]]" of the molluscs.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1985"&gt;{{cite journal

Shortly after this in 1990 Butterfield published his first paper on ''Wiwaxia''. He argued that, since ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites appeared  to be solid, they were not similar to the hollow sclerites of halkieriids. In fact he thought they were more similar to the chitinous bristles ([[setae]]) that project from the bodies of modern annelids and in some [[genus|genera]] form leaf-like scales that cover the back like roof tiles - in composition, in detailed structure, in how they were attached to the body via follicle-like pockets in the skin, and in overall appearance. He also contended that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus, instead of being mounted in the middle of its "head", was just as likely to be mounted in two parts on the sides of the "head", an arrangement that is common in polychaetes. He therefore classified ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete.&lt;ref name="Butterfield1990"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway Morris and Peel (1995) largely accepted Butterfield's arguments and treated ''Wiwaxia'' as an ancestor or "aunt" of the polychaetes. However they maintained that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus was much more like a molluscan radula. They also argued that Wiwaxia was fairly closely related to and in fact descended from the halkieriids, as the sclerites are divided into similar groups, although those of halkieriids were much smaller, more numerous and hollow. They wrote that in 1994 Butterfield had found ''Wiwaxia'' sclerites that were clearly hollow. The cladogram they presented showed the halkieriids split into three groups: one as "aunts" of [[brachiopod]]s, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the [[lophophore]]; the second group of halkieriids as "aunts" of both ''Wiwaxia'' and [[annelid]] worms; and the earliest halkieriids as "great aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1995" /&gt;

Marine biologist Amélie H. Scheltema  ''et al.'' (2003) argued that ''Wiwaxia''’s feeding apparatus is very similar to the [[radula]]s of some modern shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, and that the sclerites of the two groups are very similar. They concluded that ''Wiwaxia'' was a member of a [[clade]] that includes molluscs.&lt;ref name="www3.interscience.wiley.com"/&gt;

Danish zoologist Danny Eibye-Jacobsen (2004) regarded bristles as a feature shared by molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. Hence even if ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites closely resembled bristles, which he doubted, this would not prove that ''Wiwaxia''’s closest relative were annelids. He also pointed out that the very different numbers of sclerites in the various zones of ''Wiwaxia''’s body do not correspond to any reasonable pattern of segmentation. Since in his opinion ''Wiwaxia'' lacked other clearly polychaete features, he regarded this as an argument against classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete. In his opinion there were no strong grounds for classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc.&lt;ref name="EibyeJacobsen2004"/&gt;

Caron, Scheltema ''et al.'' (2006), in a paper about newly discovered and good specimens of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'', thought ''Wiwaxia'' bore little resemblance to polychaetes as it showed no signs of the segmentation, [[appendage]]s in front of the mouth, or "[[parapodia|legs]]" – all of which are typical polychaete features. On the other hand they thought the teeth on the feeding apparatus of both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' strongly resembled those of a modern group of molluscs, [[Neomeniomorpha]]. Hence they classified ''Wiwaxia'' as an "aunt" and ''Odontogriphus'' as a "great aunt" of molluscs.&lt;ref name="CaronScheltemaSchanderRudkin2006" /&gt;

Butterfield returned to the debate in 2006, repeating the arguments he presented in 1990 for regarding ''Wiwaxia'' as an early polychaete and adding that, while bristles are a feature of several groups, they appear as a covering over the back only in polychaetes. He also questioned whether the two or three rows of teeth in ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' could function in the same way as the belt-like molluscan radula with its many tooth-rows; on the other hand one group of polychaetes uses a single two-part "jaw" to scrape food off a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. While he agreed that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were very similar, he wrote, "… it certainly does not require that they be [[shoehorn]]ed into the same lineage. … the seemingly trivial distinction between these two taxa is exactly what is expected at the divergence points leading from a last common ancestor to extant phyla."&lt;ref name=Butterfield2006&gt;{{cite journal

Butterfield (2006) accepted that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were closely related, but argued that they were stem-group polychaetes rather than stem-group molluscs. In his opinion the feeding apparatus of these organisms, with consisted of two or at most four rows of teeth, could not perform the functions of the "belt-like" molluscan radula with their numerous tooth-rows; the different tooth-rows in both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' tooth-rows also have noticeably different shapes, while those of molluscan radulae are produced one after the other by the same group of "factory" cells and therefore are almost identical. He also regarded lines running across the middle region of ''Odontogriphus'' fossils as evidence of external segmentation, since the lines are evenly spaced and run exactly at [[right angle]]s to the long axis of the body. As in his earlier papers, Butterfield emphasized the similarities of internal structure between ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites and the bristles of polychaetes, and the fact that polychaetes are the only modern organisms in which some of the bristles form a covering over the back.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006" /&gt;

In 2007 Conway Morris and Caron described a new fossil, ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which had a [[Biomineralization|mineralized]] shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – and, like both of these, a soft underside which they interpreted as a muscular foot, and a similar arrangement of the sclerites into three [[concentric]] bands. Some of ''Orthrozanclus''’s sclerites appear to have been hollow, as the specimen includes what look like internal [[casting]]s. They took this find as evidence that the halkieriids, ''Wiwaxia'' and ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' were very closely related and formed the group "halwaxiids". However the simplest "family tree" faces an obstacle: the siphogonuchitids appear in earlier rocks and had ''mineralized'' sclerites. Hence Conway Morris and Caron found it necessary to consider two more complex family trees, concluding that "Hypothesis 1" fitted the available data better, but fell apart if there were [[sensitivity analysis|minor changes]] in the characteristics used:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#''Odontogriphus'', which had no sclerites or shells, was an "aunt" of the molluscs and the halwaxiids were a "sister" group to molluscs. ''Wiwaxia'', with only unmineralized armor, was a surviving member of the most primitive halwaxiids. The siphogonuchitids developed mineralized sclerites but grouped into a simpler "chain mail" arrangement. Halkieriids then regained the more complex three-band "chain mail" arrangement and also developed shells. ''Orthrozanclus'' lost one of the shells and its sclerites lost the mineralization. Because the siphogonuchitids appear in this family tree between ''Wiwaxia'' and the other halwaxiids, the halwaxiids are not [[monophyletic]] in this tree.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#In "Hypothesis 2" the halwaxiids are [[monophyletic]] and the siphogonuchitids are their nearest non-halwaxiid relatives. The halwaxiids plus siphogonuchitids form a "sister" group to both the annelids and brachiopods, and the molluscs are the "aunts" of all of them.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

Conway Morris and Caron (2007) published the first description of ''[[Orthrozanclus]] reburrus''. This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and ''one'' shell at what was presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to ''Halkieria''’s front shell. It also had long spines rather like those of ''Wiwaxia''. Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature as evidence that the "halwaxiids" were a valid [[taxon]] and were [[monophyletic]], in other words shared a common ancestor with each other and with no other organism. They published ''two'' cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the [[lophotrochozoa]], the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
# This is the more likely, although it falls apart if the organisms' characteristics are changed even slightly:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive molluscs, without sclerites or any kind of mineralized armor.
#*''Wiwaxia'', the siphogonotuchids, ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Halkeria'' form a side-branch of the mollusc family tree, which diverged in that order. This would mean that: ''Wiwaxia'' was the first of them to have sclerites, which were unmineralized; the siphogonotuchids were the first to have mineralized sclerites, although the scleritome was simpler; halkieriids then develop more complex scleritomes, while in ''Orthrozanclus'' the scleritome became unmineralized again and the rear shell vanished or became so  small that it has not been seen in fossils. This hypothesis faces the difficulty that siphogonotuchids appear in earlier rocks and have simpler scleritomes than the other three groups.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#*The annelids and brachiopods evolved from the other main branch of the family tree, which did not include the molluscs.
# The alternative view is:
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive lophotrochozoans.
#*The siphogonotuchids, ''Halkeria'', ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Wiwaxia'' form a group that is closer to the shared ancestor of annelids and brachiopods than it is to the molluscs. The siphogonotuchids are the first of the group to become distinctive, with ''two'' types of mineralized sclerites and a "shell" made of fused sclerites. Halkieriids had three types of sclerites  and two one-piece shells. In ''Orthrozanclus'' the sclerites became unmineralized and in ''Wiwaxia'' the shells were lost.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

==Halkieriids and siphogonotuchids==
{{further|Halkieriid}}
Most of the debate has been about halkieriids' relationship to [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[brachiopod]]s. However a paper published in 2008 argued that halkieriids were closely related to [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s, which have been generally regarded as [[sponge]]s.

===Relationship to Molluscs, Annelids and Brachiopods===
Halkieriid [[sclerite]]s were known for a long time as elements of the [[small shelly fossils]]. The first articulated specimens, with all their hard parts together, were collected in 1989 and were described briefly in 1990 by Conway Morris and Peel (1990).&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1990"&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors produced a more detailed analysis in 1995, which divided the halkieriids into three groups: one as "aunts" of [[brachiopod]]s, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the [[lophophore]]; the second group of halkieriids as "aunts" of both ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' and annelid worms; and the earliest halkieriids as "great aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1995" /&gt;

In 2003 Cohen, Holmer and Luter supported the halkieriid-brachiopod relationship, suggesting that brachiopods may have arisen from a halkieriid lineage that developed a shorter body and larger shells, and then folded itself and finally grew a stalk out of what used to be the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

Vinther and Nielsen (2005) proposed instead that ''Halkieria'' was a [[crown group]] mollusc, in other words more similar to modern molluscs than to annelids, brachiopods or any intermediate groups. They argued that: ''Halkieria''’s sclerites resembled those of the modern [[solenogaster]] [[aplacophora]]n shell-less molluscs, of some modern [[polyplacophora]]n molluscs, which have several shell plates, and of the [[Ordovician]] polyplacophoran ''[[Echinochiton]]''; ''Halkieria''’s shells are more similar to the shells of [[conchifera]]n molluscs, since shells of both of these groups show no trace of the canals and pores seen in polyplacophoran shell plates; the bristles of brachiopods and annelids are similar to each other but not to ''Halkieria''’s sclerites.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

However Conway Morris (2006) criticized Vinther and Nielsen's classification of ''Halkieria'' as a crown group mollusc, on the grounds that the growth of the spicules in the aplacophorans and polyplacophorans is not similar to the method of growth deduced for the complex halkieriid sclerites; in particular, he said, the hollow spines of various molluscs are not at all like the halkieriid sclerites with their complex internal channels. Conway Morris repeated his earlier conclusion that halkieriids were close to the ancestors of both molluscs and brachiopods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In their description of the newly discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' (2007), which has similarities to both ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids, Conway Morris and Caron also took account of the siphogonuchitids, a group known only from isolated mineralized sclerites that resemble those of the halkieriids. They proposed the two "family trees" described above:
# The halkieriids formed part of a "sister" group to the molluscs.  This hypothesis implies that the halwaxiids were not [[monophyletic]], since the siphogonuchitids appear between ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids. Nevertheless, Conway Morris and Caron found that this [[phylogeny]] fitted the available data better, although it was not robust.
# The siphogonuchitids plus the halwaxiids formed a "sister" group to the annelids and brachiopods, while the molluscs were "aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

===Relationship to chancelloriids===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chancelloriid scleritomes 01.png| thumb | right | 250px | [[Chancelloriidae|Chancelloriid]] [[sclerite|scleritomes]] ]] --&gt;
Porter (2008) revived an early 1980s idea that the sclerites of ''Halkieria'' are extremely similar to those of [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s. These were sessile, bag-like, [[Radial symmetry#Radial symmetry|radially symmetric]] organisms with an opening at the top.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;

Since their fossils show no signs of a gut or other organs, chancelloriids were originally classified as some kind of [[sponge]]. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of [[spongin]], a [[collagen]] [[protein]], in  modern keratose (horny) [[demosponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view on several grounds, including that: the [[silica]]-based spines of demosponges are solid, while chancellorid sclerites are hollow, probably made of [[aragonite]], and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal at the bases of the sclerites; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called [[pinacoderm]]s, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and show signs of connective structures called belt [[desmosome]]s. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the [[Epitheliazoa]], the next higher [[taxon]] above the [[Porifera]], to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the [[Eumetazoa]], "true animals" whose tissues are organized into [[Germ layer]]s: chancellorids' lack of internal organs would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids were descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[filter feeder|filter-feeders]].&lt;ref name="JanussenSteinerZhu2002"&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sclerites of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have an internal "pulp cavity" and a thin external organic layer; the walls are made of the same material, [[aragonite]]; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. It is extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma may be resolved in various ways:&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids"&gt;{{ cite journal 
| title=Skeletal microstructure indicates Chancelloriids and Halkieriids are closely related

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One possibility is that chancelloriids evolved from [[bilaterian]] ancestors but then adopted a sessile lifestyle and rapidly lost all unnecessary features. However the gut and other internal organs have not been lost in other bilaterians that lost their external bilateral symmetry, such as [[echinoderm]]s, [[priapulid]]s, and [[kinorhynch]]s.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;
* On the other hand, perhaps chancelloriids are similar to the organisms from which bilaterians evolved. That would imply that the earliest bilaterians had similar sclerites. However, there are no fossils of such sclerites before {{ma|542}}, while ''[[Kimberella]]'' from {{ma|555}} was almost certainly a bilaterian,&lt;ref name="Fedonkin1997"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but shows no evidence of sclerites.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;
* One solution to this [[dilemma]] may be that preservation of [[small shelly fossils]] by coatings of [[phosphate]] was common only  for a relatively short time, during the Early Cambrian, and that coelosclerite-bearing organisms were alive several million years before and after the time of phosphatic preservation. In fact there are over 25 cases of phosphatic preservation between {{ma|542}} and {{ma|521}}, but only one between {{ma|555}} and {{ma|542}}.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;
* Alternatively, perhaps the common ancestor of both chancelloriids and halkieriids had very similar but unmineralized coelosclerites, and some intermediate groups independently incorporated aragonite into these very similar structures.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

'''Edward Dembowski''' (25 April or 31 May 1822 – 27 February 1846) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]], [[journalist]], and leftist independence activist.&lt;ref name="poland"&gt;"Dembowski, Edward," ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Edward Dembowski was the son of Julia, née Kochanowska, and a conservative [[castellan]]-[[voivode]] of the [[Congress Poland]], Leon Dembowski.  On account of Edward's ''[[szlachta]]'' origins and contrasting radical social views, he was called "the red castellan's-son."

Dembowski published ''Przegląd Naukowy'' (The Learned Review), a journal for young, independence-minded [[intelligentsia]].

In 1842–43 Dembowski conducted underground revolutionary activities in the [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]n-ruled [[Congress Poland]].  Later, being at risk of arrest by Russian authorities, he transferred to [[Prussia]]n-ruled [[Greater Poland]].&lt;ref name="poland" /&gt;

During the 1846 [[Kraków Uprising]], Dembowski was secretary to [[dictator]] [[Jan Tyssowski]].  Dembowski died on 27 February 1846 at [[Podgórze]], shot by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops while leading a procession to conduct [[agitator|agitation]] among the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref name="poland" /&gt;

In his philosophical views, Dembowski was a leftist [[Hegelian]].&lt;ref name="Zarys"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The network began in Southern California in 2012 with [[Anne Balsamo]] and [[Alexandra Juhasz]] as co-founders and co-facilitators.&lt;ref name="Current" /&gt; FemTechNet describes itself as “an activated network of scholars, artists and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women's, Queer and Ethnic Studies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/the-network/ |title=About FemTechNet |publisher=FemTechNet Commons |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a peer-reviewed concept paper, the founders more concretely described the project as one of interdisciplinary community building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|last2=Balsamo|first2=Anne|last3=Juhasz|first3=Alexandra|last4=Balsamo|first4=Anne|date=2012-11-01|title=An Idea Whose Time is Here: FemTechNet – A Distributed Online Collaborative Course (DOCC)|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2012/11/issue1-juhasz/|journal=Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology|language=en-US|issue=1|doi=10.7264/N3MW2F2J|issn=2325-0496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributed open collaborative courses (DOCC), FemTechNets primary initiative, uses networked technologies in many innovative ways, including developing “nodal” classes around shared themes that are augmented by video discussions available on FemTechNet's website by participating university instructors. The first DOCC, "Dialogues in Feminism and Technology,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naili|first=Hajer|title=Feminists Launch Model for Online Learning|url=http://womensenews.org/story/education/130814/feminists-launch-model-online-learning|newspaper=Women's eNews|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated in 2013 as for-credit courses at the following institutions: 
* [[Rutgers University]] 
* [[The New School]]
* [[City University of New York|CUNY]] 
* [[University of California at San Diego]] 
* [[University of Illinois]] 
* [[Ohio State University]]
* [[Bowling Green State University]] 
* [[Pitzer College]] 
* [[Colby-Sawyer College]] 
* [[Penn State University]] 
* [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] 
* [[Ontario College of Art and Design]] 
* [[Brown University]]
* [[Yale University]]. 
Non-traditional students take the course via the FTN website's free, self-directed learner component.&lt;ref name="Current"&gt;{{cite web|last=Enlow |first=Callie |url=http://sacurrent.com/news/femtechnet-hopes-to-revolutionize-sa-s-higher-education-possibilities-1.1553684 |title=FemTechNet Hopes to Revolutionize SA's Higher Education Possibilities |work=San Antonio Current |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 - 2015 the second Distributed Open Collaborative Course (DOCC) series was offered at the following nodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://femtechnet.org/docc/previous-seasons/2013-2014/nodes/ 2013–2014 DOCC Nodes].

In 2013 FemTechNet launched "Storming Wikipedia", which aimed to encourage students to engage in [[Wikipedia]] editing. Portrayed as a response to [[Wikipedia's women problem|Wikipedia's gender imbalance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2013/08/storming-wikipedia-women-problem-internet|title=Can These Students Fix Wikipedia's Lady Problem?|author=Liss-Schultz, Nina |date=August 23, 2013|publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the assignment is also used to highlight "the significant contributions of feminists to technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naili |first=Hajer |url=https://womensenews.org/2013/08/feminists-launch-model-online-learning/#.Ug3Uvm2BaZS |title=Feminists Launch Model for Online Learning |publisher=Women's ENews |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wikistorming" got the attention of mainstream media networks, including a story by [[Fox News]] and CampusReform.org, which framed the effort as biased not critically corrective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/09/06/wikistorming-colleges-offer-credit-to-corrupt-wikipedia.html "Wikistorming: Colleges Offer Credit to Inject Feminism into Wikipedia."] Fox News. 6 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Javier Varela García''' (September 7, 1946 – May 28, 2001) was a [[Chile]]an [[biology|biologist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] who, together with his teacher [[Humberto Maturana]], is best known for introducing the concept of [[autopoiesis]] to biology, and for co-founding the [[Mind and Life Institute]] to promote dialog between science and [[Buddhism]].

==Life and career==
Varela was born in 1946 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in Chile, the son of Corina María Elena García Tapia and Raúl Andrés Varela Rodríguez.&lt;ref&gt;http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/v/a/r/Andrs-Varela/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0015.html&lt;/ref&gt; After completing secondary school at the Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino in Santiago (1951–1963), like his mentor [[Humberto Maturana]], Varela temporarily studied medicine at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and graduated with a degree in biology from the [[University of Chile]]. He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at [[Harvard University]]. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by [[Torsten Wiesel]], was titled ''Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye''.

After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 military coup]] led by [[Augusto Pinochet]], Varela and his family spent 7 years in [[exile]] in the [[United States]] before he returned to Chile to become a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile.

Varela became familiar, by practice, with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in the 1970s, initially studying, together with [[Keun-Tshen Goba]] (''né'' Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), with the meditation master [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]], founder of [[Vajradhatu]] and [[Shambhala Training]], and later with [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], a Nepalese meditation master of higher [[tantra]]s.

In 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and epistemology at the [[École Polytechnique]], and later neuroscience at the [[University of Paris]]. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as Director of Research at the [[CNRS]] (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique).

In 1987, Varela, along with [[R. Adam Engle]], founded the [[Mind and Life Institute]], initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] about the relationship between modern science and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindandlife.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as promoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind sciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the interface of science with [[meditation]] and other [[Contemplative|contemplative practices]], especially [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist practices]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindandlife.org/about/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;

Varela died in 2001 in [[Paris]] of [[Hepatitis C]] after having written an account of his 1998 liver transplant.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oikos.org/varelafragments.htm Intimate Distances - Fragments for a Phenomenology of Organ Transplantation]"&lt;/ref&gt; Varela had four children, including the actress, environmental spokesperson, and model [[Leonor Varela]].

==Work==
Varela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the influence of different teachers, [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]].

He wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in [[biology]], [[neurology]], [[cognitive science]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]]. He founded, with others, the [[Integral Institute]], a [[thinktank]] dedicated to the cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines.

Varela supported [[embodied philosophy]], viewing human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in terms of the [[enaction|enactive structures]] in which they arise. These comprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and the physical world with which it interacts. &lt;ref&gt;Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1991). The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience. Cambridge, MA: The [[MIT Press]]. {{ISBN|0-262-72021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varela's work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of [[neurophenomenology]]. This concept combined the phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]] and of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], with "first person science." Neurophenomenology requires observers to examine their own conscious experience using scientifically verifiable methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4879">The '''Great Goddess Hypothesis''' is that in [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] and/or [[Neolithic]] Europe and Western Asia and North Africa, a singular, [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] female deity was worshipped prior to the development of the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[paganism|pagan]] religions of the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]]. Having first been proposed as an idea relating to ancient Greek religion in 1849, it subsequently achieved some support amongst classicists. In the early 20th century, various historians began to postulate about the theory applying across Europe, and it was widely propagated by the archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] in the 1980s. It has since been adopted by various feminist religious groups such as [[Dianic Wicca]] as a part of the mythology of their faith.

== Development of the theory ==

The theory had been first proposed by the German Classicist [[Eduard Gerhard]] in 1849, when he speculated that the various goddesses found in [[Religion in Ancient Greece|ancient Greek paganism]] had been representations of a singular goddess who had been worshipped far further back into [[prehistory]]. He associated this deity with the concept of [[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard, Eduard (1849). ''Über Metroen und Götter-Mutter''. Berlin. Page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; which itself had only been developed in the 18th century by members of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1999). ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft''. New York: Oxford University Press. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, this theory began to be adopted by other classicists in France and Germany, such as Ernst Kroker, Fr. Lenormant and M.J. Menant, who further brought in the idea that the ancient peoples of [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] had influenced the Greek religion, and that therefore they also had once venerated a great goddess.&lt;ref name=hutton-36&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1999). ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft''. New York: Oxford University Press. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas amongst various classicists echoed those of the Swiss judge J.J. Bachofen, who put forward the idea that the earliest human societies were [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], but had converted to a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] form in later prehistory. Commenting on this idea, the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1999) remarked that in the eyes of many at the time, it would have been an obvious conclusion that "what was true in a secular sphere should also, logically, have been so in the religious one."&lt;ref name=hutton-36/&gt;

In 1901, the archaeologist [[Sir Arthur Evans]]—who in an 1895 work had dismissed the Great Goddess theory&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Arthur (1895). ''Cretan Pictographs and Prae-Phoenician Script''. Pages 124–131.&lt;/ref&gt;—changed his mind and accepted the idea whilst excavating at [[Knossos]] on [[Crete]], the site of the Bronze Age [[Minoan civilisation]]. After unearthing a number of female figurines, he came to believe that they all represented a singular goddess, who was the Minoan's chief deity, and that all the male figurines found on the site represented a subordinate male god who was both her son and consort, an idea that he based partially upon the later classical myth of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Arthur (1901-02). The Palace of Knossos in the Annual of the British School at Athens viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In later writings in ensuing decades he went on to associate these Neolithic and Bronze Age images with other goddesses around the [[Near East]]. As Hutton pointed out, "his influence made this the orthodoxy of Minoan archaeology, although there was always a few colleagues who pointed out that it placed a strain upon the evidence."&lt;ref name=hutton-36/&gt;

In 1903, Sir Edmund Chambers, a respected amateur historian of the mediaeval period, published ''The Medieval Stage'', in which he diverted from his main theme to state how he believed that in prehistory, humans had worshipped a Great Earth Mother as a twofold deity who was both the creator and the destroyer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} That same year, the classicist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] espoused a similar idea, but claimed that this prehistoric Great Goddess had been [[Triple deity|divided into three forms]]—she theorised this based upon the fact that in various recorded polytheistic European religions, there were a set of three goddesses, such as the [[Moirai|Fates]] and the [[Graces]]. Harrison identified two of these as the Maiden, who ruled over the living, and the Mother, who ruled the underworld, and like Evans believed that a male god who was both her lover and son was also worshipped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5439">'''Heroic virtue''' is a phrase coined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] to describe the [[virtue ethics|virtue]] of early [[Christian]] martyrs and used by the [[Catholic Church]].  The Greek pagan term [[hero]] described a person with possibly superhuman abilities and great goodness, and "it connotes a degree of bravery, fame, and distinction which places a man high above his fellows".&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was later applied to other highly virtuous persons who do extraordinary good works.

Heroic virtue is one of the requirements for [[beatification]] in the Catholic Church.  The modern process for declaring heroic virtue is internal to the church and conducted by those in senior positions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Quoting the Catholic view  from the article on Heroic Virtue by J. Wilhelm in the 1917 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Together with the four [[cardinal virtues]] the Christian saint must be endowed with the [[three theological virtues]], especially with Divine [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], the virtue which informs all other virtues.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As charity stands at the summit of all virtues, so [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] stands at their foundation. For by faith God is first apprehended, and the soul lifted up to supernatural life. Faith is the secret of one's conscience; to the world it is made manifest by the good works in which it lives, "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:2). Such works are: the external profession of faith, strict observance of the Divine commands, [[prayer]], filial devotion to the Church, the [[fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], the horror of sin, [[penance]] for sins committed, patience in adversity, etc. All or any of these attain the grade of heroicity when practiced with unflagging perseverance, during a long period of time, or under circumstances so trying that by them men of but ordinary perfection would be deterred from acting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hope (virtue)|Hope]] is a firm trust that God will give us eternal life and all the means necessary to obtain it; it attains heroicity when it amounts to unshakeable confidence and security in God's help throughout all the untoward events of life, when it is ready to forsake and sacrifice all other goods in order to obtain the promised felicity of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Charity inclines man to love God above all things with the love of friendship. The perfect friend of God says with St. Paul: "With Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:19-20). For love means union. Its type in heaven is the Divine Trinity in Unity; its highest degree in God's creatures is the [[beatific vision]], i.e. participation in God's life. On earth it is the fruitful mother of holiness, the one thing necessary, the one all-sufficient possession. It is extolled in I Cor., xiii, and in St. John's Gospel and Epistles; the beloved disciple and the fiery missionary of the cross are the best interpreters of the mystery of love revealed to them in the [[Sacred Heart|Heart of Jesus]]. With the commandment to love God above all Jesus coupled another: "And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these" (Mark 12:31). The likeness, or the linking of the two commandments, lies in this: that in our neighbor we love God's image and likeness, His adopted children and the heirs of His Kingdom. Hence, serving our neighbor is serving God. And the works of spiritual and temporal mercy performed in this world will decide our fate in the next: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom. . .For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. . .Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me" ({{bibleref|Matthew|25:34–40}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Prudence]], which enables us to know what to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it coincides with the "gift of counsel", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Justice]], which gives every one his due, is the pivot on which turn the virtues of religion, piety, obedience, gratitude, truthfulness, friendship, and many more. Jesus sacrificing His life to give God His due, [[Abraham]] willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's will, these are acts of heroic justice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Courage|Fortitude]], which urges us on when difficulty stands in the way of our duty, is itself the heroic element in the practice of virtue; it reaches its apex when it overcomes obstacles which to ordinary virtue are insurmountable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], which restrains us when passions urge us to what is wrong, comprises becoming deportment, modesty, abstinence, chastity, sobriety, and others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In fine'' it should be remarked that almost every act of virtue proceeding from the Divine principle within us has in it the elements of all the virtues; only mental analysis views the same act under various aspects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">'''Homology''' in [[psychology]], as [[Homology (biology)|in biology]], refers to a relationship between characteristics that reflects the characteristics' origins in either evolution or development. Homologous behaviors can theoretically be of at least two different varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David S.|title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|year=2013|volume=55|issue=1|pages=13–21|doi=10.1002/dev.21015|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full|accessdate=11 July 2013|pmid=22711075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with [[Homology (biology)|homologous anatomical characteristics]], behaviors present in different species can be considered homologous if they are likely present in those species because the behaviors were present in a common ancestor of the two species. Alternatively, in much the same way as reproductive structures (e.g., the penis and the clitoris) are considered homologous because they share a common origin in embryonic tissues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=G. P.|title=The biological homology concept|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1989|volume=20|pages=51–69|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.20.110189.000411}}&lt;/ref&gt; behaviors—or the [[neural substrate]]s associated with those behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michael L.|author2=Penner-Wilger, M.|title=Neural reuse in the evolution and development of the brain: Evidence for developmental homology?|journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013|volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=42–51|doi=10.1002/dev.21055|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21055/full|accessdate=11 July 2013|pmid=22711453}}&lt;/ref&gt;—can also be considered homologous if they share common origins in development.

Behavioral homologies have been considered since at least 1958, when [[Konrad Lorenz]] studied the evolution of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |authorlink=Konrad Lorenz |title=The Evolution of Behavior |journal=Scientific American |year=1958 |volume=199 |issue=6 |pages=67–78 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1258-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the question of behavioral homologies has been addressed by [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] such as [[Marc Ereshefsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ereshefsky|first=Marc|title=Psychological categories as homologies: Lessons from ethology |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |year=2007|volume=22 |pages=659–674 |doi=10.1007/s10539-007-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |title=Homology thinking |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=March 2012 |doi=10.1007/s10539-012-9313-7 |volume=27 |pages=381–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychologists such as Drew Rendall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rendall |first=Drew |author2=Di Fiore |title=Homoplasy, homology, and the perceived special status of behavior in evolution |journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2007 |volume=52 |pages=504–521|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.11.014 |pmid=17383711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscientist]]s such as Georg Striedter and Glenn Northcutt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Striedter|first=Georg |author2=Northcutt |title=Biological hierarchies and the concept of homology|journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution |year=1991 |volume=38 |pages=177–189 |doi=10.1159/000114387}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is debatable whether the concept of homology is useful in [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blumberg|first=Mark S.|title=Homology, correspondence, and continuity across development: The case of sleep |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013|volume=55 |issue=1|pages=92–100 |doi=10.1002/dev.21024 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21024/full |pmid=22711221 |pmc=3459138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop: Homology in Developmental Psychology|url=http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/homology/|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore|first1=David S. |title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |date=January 2013|volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |doi=10.1002/dev.21015|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D. W.; Flanery, Randall C. |editor=Lamb, M. E.; Brown, A. L. |title=Social Conflict and Dominance in Children: a Case for a Primate Homology |work=Advances in Developmental Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtDGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125|year=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |isbn=978-1-135-83123-3 |page=125 |quote=Finally, much recent information on children's ''and'' nonhuman primates' behavior in groups, a conjunction of hard human data and hard nonhuman primate data, lends credence to our comparison. Our conclusion is that, based on their agreement in several unusual characteristics, dominance patterns are homologous in primates. This agreement of unusual characteristics is found at several levels, including fine motor movement, gross motor movement, and behavior at the group level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacqueline Laing''' is a legal philosopher and academic, specializing in [[jurisprudence]], or the [[philosophy of law]], [[criminal law]] and [[applied ethics]]. She has taught at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]],  [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], [[King's College, London]], [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], and [[Melbourne University]]. She is a barrister of the [[High Court of Australia]] and a solicitor of the [[Supreme Court of England and Wales]].

== Education ==
Born in Scotland and educated in [[Calcutta]], India, and [[Canberra]], Australia, she took degrees in philosophy and law at the [[Australian National University]], clerked to a judge in Canberra and won a Commonwealth scholarship to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where she undertook a doctorate on the concept of intention in the law of homicide under the direction of [[John Finnis]].

== Euthanasia ==
Laing’s interests lie in the field of jurisprudence and applied ethics. Commenting on contemporary moral conundrums she applies natural law thinking&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Laing and Russell Wilcox, A Natural Law Reader, Blackwell, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to questions about the family, life and death,&lt;ref&gt;David S Oderberg and Jacqueline A Laing Human Lives: Critical Essays on Consequentialist Bioethics, London, Macmillan, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and the limits of legal regulation. On the subject of voluntary euthanasia she argues that institutionalizing medically assisted death erodes respect for human life,&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Laing (1990), "Assisting Suicide" Journal of Criminal Law, 54, 106-116.&lt;/ref&gt; endangers the vulnerable and disabled, underestimates human capacity for error and vice and is intrinsically discriminatory. She argues that it plays into the hands of illicit interests and trades on an improper understanding of human autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;On the limits of personal autonomy see Laing, Jacqueline A. (2004), "Law, Liberalism and the Common Good" ''Human Values: New Essays on Ethics and Natural Law'' Edited by David S. Oderberg and T.D.J. Chappell, London, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 184-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  She warns against dismissing "the army of corporate, financial, medical and political interests that there are in controlling death, euthanasia’s corrosive effects on public and professional attitudes, and the discrimination implicit in its implementation."&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline A. (2012) "Not In My Name" New Law Journal, 162, 81&lt;/ref&gt; Of the vested interests that there are in controlling death she says:

:"Organs for transplant are an ongoing incentive for active euthanasia. So too is cost-saving, litigation and payout minimisation, bed clearing, medical research, improper individual concerns about inheritance and even political Malthusianism. In this environment, failures of transparency, i.e. lies and deception, are both pragmatic and inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline A. (2012) "Not In My Name" New Law Journal, 162, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

She regards the practice a threat to the elderly, disabled and terminally ill:&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline A. (2010) "On the Wrong Track" Solicitors Journal, 154, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"Whenever euthanasia comes up for debate, disquiet is expressed by disability groups. These fears are far from irrational. Efforts to institutionalise the practice are predicated on the idea that certain subjects are appropriate for elimination, while others are of sufficient value to be worth preserving. Discrimination against the vulnerable, and thus Art 14 incompatibility, bedevils this ethical terrain. The sick, the terminally ill and the disabled are invariably the first to be regarded as proper subjects for medically assisted suicide. The logic of active euthanasia endangers the vulnerable by inviting one of the gravest of crimes in law. The practice undermines the dignity of those who may indeed be a burden."&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline A. (2012) "Not In My Name" New Law Journal, 162, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

She asserts that voluntary euthanasia logically collapses into involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia, and that this reality, widely dismissed as a fallacious slippery slope argument, is borne out by Dutch and Belgian statistics demonstrating widespread non-consensual euthanasia, false reporting and under-reporting.

A critic of the Bland Case,&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline (2002), "Vegetative" State – The Untold Story" New Law Journal 152, 1272.&lt;/ref&gt; she has highlighted the problem of passive euthanasia by incentivised and managerialised sedation-and-dehydration in hospitals (Royal Society of Medicine, London W1 18 June 2012), a position that provoked revealing Freedom of Information Act requests which in turn led to the 2012-13 inquiry into the problem in the UK. In "Food and Fluids: Human Law, Human Rights and Human Interests"&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline "Food and Fluids: Human Law, Human Rights and Human Interests"  in  Artificial Nutrition and Hydration C. Tollefsen, ed., Springer Press 2008, pp. 77-100&lt;/ref&gt;  she argues that financial, medical, and political interests are bound to incentivise and invite homicide of the vulnerable. An early critic of what she terms the sedation-dehydration regimes, she writes of the [[Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient|Liverpool Care Pathway]]:
:"However useful the Pathway may be in individual cases properly applied, incentivised and managerialised death targets become problematic in the context of uncertain diagnosis, a steadily ageing population, spiralling healthcare costs, and the philosophical dehumanisation of the vulnerable pervasive in contemporary bioethics. The targets themselves constitute improper pressure on healthcare professionals’ employment and livelihood. As such, they are likely to invite and rationalise grave human rights abuse with tragic consequences for the defenceless incapacitated in hospitals and care homes."

== Utilitarianism ==
A critic of utilitarianism,  in ''Innocence and Consequentialism''  she argued in 1996 that utilitarianism has insufficient conceptual apparatus to comprehend the very idea of innocence, a feature central to any comprehensive ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline A. (1997), "Innocence and Consequentialism" in Human Lives: Critical Essays on Consequentialist Bioethics, eds. J. A. Laing with D. S. Oderberg. London, Macmillan, pp. 196-224&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Baby farming}}In particular, [[Peter Singer#Bestiality|Peter Singer]] on her view, cannot without contradicting himself reject baby farming (a thought experiment that involves mass-producing deliberately brain damaged children for live birth for the greater good of organ harvesting) and at the same time hold on to his "personism" a term coined by [[Jenny Teichman]] to describe his fluctuating (and Laing says, irrational and discriminatory) theory of human moral value. His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both ‘non-persons’ who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.

== Eugenics and biometric databases ==
Laing contends that the practice of [[eugenics]] has not disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline (2006), "The Prohibition on Eugenics and Reproductive Liberty" University of New South Wales Law Journal 29, 261-266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conceptually related to the utilitarian and Social Darwinist worldview and historically evolving out of the practice of slavery, it led to some of the most spectacular human rights abuses in history.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline (2009), "Los derechos humanos y la nueva eugenesia" 4, SCIO 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The compulsory sterilization of and experimentation on those deemed "undesirable" and "unfit" in many technologically developed states like the US, Scandinavia, and Japan, led inexorably and most systematically to Nazi Germany with the elimination of countless millions of people for their race, class, political views, sexuality, religion or disability. She argues that the new eugenics adopted by [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]],  [[Julian Savulescu]] and others, collapses into the old variety because of its fixation on producing "the better" or even more implausibly, "the best". It was this very idea that drove much of the injustice of the twentieth century. Ethically questionable strategies were at the time viewed as progressive and socially evolutionary. The new eugenics, she thinks, fares no better and spells disaster for people regarded as deficient in some way. She rejects the idea that autonomous efforts to choose "better" or the "best" children are less problematic for being freely chosen.
The fact that one freely chooses to give one’s children away into slavery or lethal medical experimentation or to create a hundred clones of oneself, is no bar to the action’s being independently at odds with intergenerational justice and the common good. She suggests that mistake, ignorance, misinformation, propaganda and behaviour modification techniques, subliminal or otherwise, are celebrated ways of getting people to act freely in ways that undermine intergenerational justice and the common good. Laing suggests that biometric databases and identity cards exposing one’s medical data, DNA defects, IQ, and political views, while in many ways proving socially useful, demonstrate how vulnerable humans are, not just at the hands of political misfeasors and tyrants but insurance companies, government and corporate snoopers, and determined social and bioethical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Jacqueline (2008), "Information Technology and Biometric Databases: Eugenics and Other Threats to Disability Rights" Journal of Legal Technology Risk Management 3, 9-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here's why – The Economic Times|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|ta-Latn|Jallikattu}} is typically practised in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]] as a part of [[Pongal]] celebrations on [[Mattu Pongal]] day, which occurs annually in January.

As there were events of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban to the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However, with protest from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport.

== Etymology ==
Ancient [[Tamil Sangams]] described the practice as {{lang|ta-Latn|yeru thazhuvuthal}} ({{Lang-ta|ஏறு தழுவுதல்}}), literally 'bull embracing'.&lt;ref name="Buzzing with bull talk" /&gt; The modern term {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} ({{Lang|ta|ஜல்லிக்கட்டு}}) or {{lang|ta-Latn|sallikattu}} ({{Lang|ta|சல்லிக்கட்டு}}) is derived from {{lang|ta-Latn|salli}} ('coins') and {{lang|ta-Latn|kattu}} ('package'), which refers to a prize of coins that are tied to the bull's horns and that participants attempt to retrieve.&lt;ref name="Hindustan Times etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-of-pongal-outrage-over-jallikattu-but-not-over-drought/story-7KOJUrvB0J3SwOnHXnPbjL.html|title=Politics of Pongal: Outrage over Jallikattu but not over drought in Tamil Nadu|date=14 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|ta-Latn|manju virattu}} ({{Script|Taml|மஞ்சு விரட்டு}}) literally means 'bull chasing'.

== History ==
[[File:A Bull baiting inscription 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription on {{lang|ta-Latn|eru thazhuvuthal}} at government museum in Tamil Nadu.]]
{{lang|ta-Latn|Jallikattu}} has been known to be practiced during the [[Sangam period|Tamil classical period]] (400-100 BC).&lt;ref name="jallikattu_ebook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o56i5ymOIBkC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=jallikattu+history|title=A Western Journalist on India: The Ferengi's Columns|author=François Gautier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jallikattu_nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/travel/21webletter.html|title=Fearless Boys with Bulls in Avaniapuram|quote=''The ritual dates back as far as 2,000 years...''|access-date =9 July 2008|publisher=The New York Times| first=Daniel| last=Grushkin| date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common among the ancient people [[Ayar|Aayars]] who lived in the ‘[[Sangam landscape|Mullai]]’ geographical division of the ancient Tamil country.&lt;ref name="Buzzing with bull talk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/society/buzzing-with-bull-talk/article5553456.ece?homepage=true|title= Buzzing with bull talk|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=8 January 2014 |access-date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/who-said-bullfight-is-cruel-go-to-hell-its-our-tradition-180408.html|title=Who said bullfighting is cruel?|publisher=Firstpost|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it became a platform for display of bravery and prize money was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] depicting the practice is preserved in the [[National Museum, New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=T.

== Variants and rules ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Some variants include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011553700400.htm |title=An ancient tradition sport |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |accessdate=13 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626112519/http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011553700400.htm |archivedate=26 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{lang|ta-Latn|Vadi manjuviraṭṭu}}:  This is the most common category of {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}}.  The bull is released from a closed space ({{lang|ta-Latn|vadi vasal}}) and the contestants attempt to wrap their arms or hands around the hump of the bull and hold on to it to win the award. Only one person is allowed to attempt at a time. This variant is most common in the districts of Madurai, Theni, Thanjavur, and Salem.
*{{lang|ta-Latn|Vēli viraṭṭu}}:  In this variant the approach is slightly different as the bull is directly released into open ground. The rules are the same as that of ''vadi majuviraṭṭu.''  This is a popular variant in the districts of Sivagangai and Madurai.
*{{lang|ta-Latn|Vaṭam manjuviraṭṭu}}: In this variant, the bull is tied with a {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} rope ({{lang|ta-Latn|vatam}} means 'circle' in Tamil). There are no other physical restrictions for the bull and hence it can move freely anywhere. The maximum time period given is 30 minutes. A team of seven to nine members can attempt to untie the gift token that is tied on the bull's horn.

Bulls enter the competition area through a gate called the {{lang|ta-Latn|vadi vasal}}. Typically, participants must only hold onto the bull's hump, and in some variations they are disqualified if they hold onto the bull's neck, horns or tail. There may be several goals to the game depending on region. In some versions, contestants must either hold the bulls hump for 30 seconds or for {{Convert|15|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsable.asianetnews.tv/south/rules-of-jallikattu-ban-supreme-court-pongal-without-bull-taming-tamil-nadu-jallikattu|title=‘Bulls cannot be hurt’ is the golden rule of Jallikattu, but who follows it?|website=asianetnews.tv|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/videos/jallikattu:-what-are-the-rules-of-the-game/393|title=Jallikattu: What are the rules of the game|accessdate=20 January 2017|publisher=Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breeding ==
''[[Zebu|Bos indicus]]'' bulls are bred specifically by people of the village for the event. Bulls that are able to participate successfully in the {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} event are used as studs for breeding. These bulls also fetch higher prices in the markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36798500|title=Jallikattu: Why India bullfighting ban 'threatens native breeds'|last=Natarajan|first=Swaminathan|date=19 July 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and preparation ==
[[File:ஏறுதழுவும் விழா.JPG|thumb|Bull being prepared for {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}}]]

=== Preparation ===
With the introduction of the Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawsofindia.org/statelaw/7702/TheTamilNaduRegulationofJallikattuAct2009.html|title=Laws of India: The Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009|website=www.lawsofindia.org|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Tamil Nadu legislature, the following activities were done in preparation of the event:
# A written permission is obtained from the respective collector, thirty days prior to conduct of event along with notification of the event location.
# The arena and the way through which the bulls pass through is double-barricaded, in order to avoid injuries to the spectators and by-standers who may be permitted to remain within the barricades.
# The necessary gallery areas are built up along the double barricades.
# The necessary permissions are obtained from the collector for the participants and the bulls fifteen days prior.
# Final preparation before the event include a complete testing by the authorities of the Animal Husbandry Department, to ensure that performance enhancement drugs, liquor or other irritants are not used on the bulls.

==Impact==
Between 2008 and 2014, 43 humans and 4 bulls were killed in the {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} events. In 2017, there were 23 deaths in addition to about 2,500 human injuries and several instances of injury to the bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = '23 died in jallikattu in last one year' | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | pages = | language = | publisher = Kasturi &amp; Sons | date = 8 February 2018 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/23-died-in-jallikattu-in-last-one-year/article22683470.ece | accessdate = 11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal welfare concerns are related to the handling of the bulls before they are released and also during competitor's attempts to subdue the bull. Practices before the bull is released include prodding the bull with sharp sticks or scythes, extreme bending of the tail which can fracture the [[vertebra]]e, and biting of the bull's tail.  There are also reports of the bulls being forced to drink alcohol to disorient them, or [[chilli pepper]]s being rubbed in their eyes to aggravate the bull.&lt;ref name="Ray"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jallikattu cheat sheet: 10 things you should know about the bull-taming sport|author=Ray, A.|publisher=Economic Times|date=19 Jan 2017|accessdate=23 January 2017|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jallikattu-cheat-sheet-10-things-you-should-know-about-the-bull-taming-sport/articleshow/56664079.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During attempts to subdue the bull, they are stabbed by various implements such as knives or sticks, punched, jumped on and dragged to the ground.  In variants in which the bull is not enclosed, they may run into traffic or other dangerous places, sometimes resulting in broken bones or death.&lt;ref name="Natarajan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jallikattu: Why India bullfighting ban 'threatens native breeds'|author=Natarajan, S.|publisher=BBC News|date=19 July 2016|accessdate=20 January 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36798500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mogul"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jallikattu debate: Animal rights experts expose 'cruelty' of Indian bullfighting tradition|author=Mogul, P.|date=12 January 2016 |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/jallikattu-debate-animal-rights-experts-expose-cruelty-indian-bullfighting-tradition-1537536 |accessdate=3 February 2017|publisher=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors claims that {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} is promoted as bull taming, however, others suggest it exploits the bull's natural nervousness as prey animals by deliberately placing them in a terrifying situation in which they are forced to run away from the competitors which they perceive as predators and the practice effectively involves catching a terrified animal.&lt;ref name="Vikram Venkateswaran"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thequint.com/india/2017/01/11/jallikattu-is-not-barbaric-banning-it-destroys-local-breeds-a-cattle-market-reveals-all-meat-market-cows-bulls | work=The Quint| title= Jallikattu Ban: ‘Send Them to the Butchers’ is now the only option|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with human injuries and fatalities, bulls themselves sometimes sustain injuries or die, which people may interpret as a bad omen for the village.

An investigation by the Animal Welfare Board of India concluded that "jallikattu is inherently cruel to animals".&lt;ref name="Maulekhi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jallikattu: Bull taming is cruelty at its best, TN parties using it for political gains|author=Maulekhi, G.|date=13 January 2017|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=FirstPost|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-tn-parties-using-it-for-political-gains-2564184.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rajagopol, Krishnadas |date=22 September 2016 |title=SC to hear Animal Welfare Board’s petition challenging jallikattu order |newspaper=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-to-hear-Animal-Welfare-Board%E2%80%99s-petition-challenging-jallikattu-order/article13994379.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ban, protests and authorization===

[[File:Protesters at Marina.jpg|thumb|Anti-ban protesters at Marina beach, January 2017.]]
The [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] filed a case in the [[Supreme Court of India]] for an outright ban on {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} because of the [[cruelty to animals]] and the threat to public safety involved.

On 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] to allow {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} for five months in a year and directed the [[District Collector]]s to make sure that the animals that participate in {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor the event.&lt;ref name="Sify" /&gt; The [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] ordered that {{INRConvert|2|L}} be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured.&lt;ref name="Sify"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/news/1-killed-30-injured-in-jallikattu-news-national-lbqxadbecdbsi.html|title=1 killed in Jalikattu|publisher=sify.com|date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the event&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://onelawstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Animal-Welfare-Board-of-India-v.-A-Nagraja-Jallikattu.pdf|title = Animal Welfare Board of India vs. Nagaraja|date = 7 May 2014|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.petaindia.com/blog/sc-bans-jallikattu-bull-races-fights/|title=SC bans Jalikattu|publisher=PETA|access-date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the practice continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009.&lt;ref name="JallikattuRegulationAct"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tniuscbe.org/download/gg/gg190.pdf|title = Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act|date = 21 July 2009|access-date = |website = |publisher = The Wire|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2014, the [[Supreme Court of India]] struck down the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|state]] law and banned {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} altogether.&lt;ref name="PETA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{Cite news|author=J.Venkatesan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/supreme-court-bans-jallikattu-in-tamil-nadu/article5986025.ece|title=Supreme Court bans Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu|publisher=''The Hindu''|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-bans-Jallikattu-bull-fights-in-Tamil-Nadu/articleshow/34778562.cms|title=SC bans Jallikattu bull fights in-Tamil-Nadu |publisher=''The Times of India''|access-date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also asked the [[Government of India]] to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. The Supreme Court also ruled that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate is subjecting them to unnecessary pain and suffering, so such events were outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-is-an-abuse-not-a-sport-sc-to-hear-pleas-against-centre-notification-lifting-ban-on-jallikattu-2579990.html|title='Jallikattu is an abuse, not a sport': SC to hear pleas against Centre notification lifting ban on Jallikattu|publisher=First Post|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecitizen.in/NewsDetail.aspx?Id=6507&amp;Jallikattu:/Red/Rag/For/the/Law|title=Jallikattu: Red Rag For the Law|publisher=The Citizen|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal situation surrounding {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} is as yet not clearly resolved. Some, such as ex  [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]] cabinet minister [[Salman Khurshid]], have stated that the matter will only be truly resolved if the [[Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act]] is amended as [[local ordinances]] and state laws cannot trump [[Law of India|Indian federal law]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/jallikattu-row-matter-could-still-go-to-supreme-court-and-we-could-get-adverse-decision-says-salman-khurshid/516973/|title=Jallikattu Row: Matter could still go to Supreme Court and we could get adverse decision, says Salman&amp;nbsp;Khurshid|date=2017-01-21|newspaper=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Hindu]]'', many other Indian legal experts agreed with Khurshid's view, as federal laws such as the PCA are always more powerful than state laws, and in that respect the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned in 2009.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/jallikattu-protesters-demand-permanent-solution/article9496334.ece|title=Jallikattu protesters demand permanent solution|last=|first=|date=2017-01-22|work=|newspaper=The Hindu Business Line|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, PETA India has said that it will "study" the new ordinance, and has not ruled out a challenge to the new law on the same grounds as it challenged the 2009 law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruelty-to-animals-is-anti-india-says-peta-india-ceo-amid-jallikattu-protests/story-kJgbed7mmFiMPoq9vB8oSO.html|title=Jallikattu reflects poorly on India: PETA India CEO after ‘bullying’|last=|first=|date=2017-01-23|work=|newspaper=The Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Jan 25, the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] (AWBI) started the legal process towards another ban by formally challenging the new law before the Supreme Court,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jan/25/jallikattu-challenged-again-in-supreme-court-by-animal-rights-body-1563367.html|title=Jallikattu challenged again in Supreme Court by animal rights body|last=|first=|date=2017-01-25|work=|newspaper=The New Indian Express|access-date=2017-01-27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they withdrew the petition on Jan 26.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newstodaynet.com/chennai/awbi-withdraw-plea-against-tn-jallikattu-law|title=AWBI to withdraw plea against TN Jallikattu law|last=|first=|date=2017-01-26|work=|newspaper=News Today|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126115359/http://newstodaynet.com/chennai/awbi-withdraw-plea-against-tn-jallikattu-law|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AWBI's acting chairperson, AWBI does not plan to re-file the petition, but he claimed no knowledge of what other organizations, such as PETA, may do.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
{{lang|ta-Latn|Jallikattu}} is often shown in [[Tamil cinema]] where the hero tames the bull to prove his gallantry.&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/rajini-kamal-and-ranas-connection-with-jallikattu.html|title=Rajni, Kamal did it|publisher=Behindwoods|access-date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the popular movies include:

Popular cinema, an integral part of the modern social and political life of Tamil Nadu, has often portrayed {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} as a symbol of masculinity and social status. There are instances of the portrayal running as a counter-narrative, wherein a young hero tames an overlord's bull and turns it into a challenge to power and authority.&lt;ref name=StalinRajangamHindu&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/In-films-jallikattu-showcases-masculinity/article13384627.ece
|title=In films, jallikattu showcases masculinity
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In films such as ''Cheran Pandian'', ''Rajakumaran'', and ''Murattukaalai'', the conflict between the hero and the villain is portrayed through {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}}, during which the owner whose bull loses shoots the bull.&lt;ref name=StalinRajangamToI&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Jallikattu-Power-play-by-caste-bigwigs-in-villages/articleshow/34999811.cms
|title=Jallikattu: Power play by caste bigwigs in villages
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Mannvasanai'', the heroine's father declares that whoever tames the bull is eligible to marry his daughter, but kills the animal and commits suicide after an outsider from a nearby village tames it and lays claim to his daughter as the prize.&lt;ref name=StalinRajangamHindu/&gt; 
In ''Virumaandi'' the hero who returns from Singapore tames the bull, which means that his masculinity and traditional roots are intact, despite going to a foreign land.&lt;ref name=StalinRajangamHindu/&gt;
In ''Thaiku pin Tharam'', {{lang|ta-Latn|jallikattu}} is built into the film's climax, and it helps the hero prove he is worthy enough to win the girl.&lt;ref name=dailyOAkshyaNath&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5494">'''John Norbert Deck''' (born [[Buffalo, New York]], December 2, 1921; died September 5, 1979) was a Canadian philosopher. Adhering to neither sartorial nor intellectual fashions, Deck inspired generations of students with his highly idiosyncratic form of idealism, deriving from [[Plotinus]] but equally rooted in [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]]. 

==Education and career==
He was educated at [[Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]], which at that time was affiliated with the [[University of Western Ontario]] (B.A., 1946, M.A., 1946).  He received his Ph.D. in philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1960.  His doctoral dissertation reappraised the [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[Plotinus]] from the standpoint of a central doctrine in his [[Enneads]], exploring how "contemplative producing" gives rise to every level of reality, including the physical world; it was published as ''Nature, Contemplation, and the One: A Study in the Philosophy of [[Plotinus]]'' by the University of Toronto Press in 1967. 

After serving as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [[Boston College]]  and a brief stint working for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], in 1957 he became Professor of Philosophy at Assumption College, (later known as the [[University of Windsor]]), where he taught graduate and undergraduate courses in metaphysics and the history of philosophy until his death. The University of Windsor awards the John N. Deck Memorial Prize in Philosophy each year "in recognition of outstanding scholastic achievement or proficiency."

At a time when [[Neoplatonism]] in philosophy, as well as philosophy itself in the university, was considered hopelessly outdated, he developed a freshman class called "Dream worlds and real worlds" that brought the message of Plotinus to the most unpromising students; it proved to be immensely popular, disconcerting his academic rivals.

Although he died in 1979, he is arguably more popular and influential now than ever before. ''Nature, Contemplation, and the One'' was republished in 1991 (back in print for the first time after over twenty years, and in a convenient paperback) and now a proliferation of websites such as Anthony Flood's [http://www.anthonyflood.com/deck.htm] are making available his articles for ongoing discussion.

==Legacy==
R. Baine Harris, Director of the International [[Neoplatonic]] Society, has called ''Nature, Contemplation and the One'' "the best book on [[Plotinus]]" and said that "it must be read by all modern serious students of Plotinus."

Anthony Damiani, a longtime student of [[Paul Brunton]] and founder of Wisdom's Goldenrod Center for Philosophic Studies in upstate New York, considered Deck's magnum opus, ''Nature, Contemplation, and the One'' to be the best guide to Plotinus.  His publishing house, Larson, has republished it in paperback with a brief introduction by Deck's friend and executor, Lawrence Dewan, which places Deck as a member of the "workshop of Plotinus."  They have also reissued an edition of [[Stephen MacKenna]]'s translation of the ''[[Enneads]]'' of [[Plotinus]], which footnotes alternate translations from all the later scholars, especially Deck.

'''Juan David García Bacca''' ([[Pamplona]],  June 26, 1901 - [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], August 5, 1992), was a Spanish-Venezuelan philosopher and university professor.

Garcia Bacca studied under the [[Claretians]] and became a priest in 1925. He continued his formative studies at the [[University of Munich]], [[University of Zurich]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Yet he quit the Church during the 1930s and began to study philosophy at the [[University of Barcelona]]. In 1936 he went into exile because of his criticism of [[Francisco Franco]], traveling first to [[Ecuador]], where he taught at the [[Central University of Ecuador]] (1939–42) where he became a close friend with the writer [[Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco]], then to [[México]], where he taught at the [[UNAM]] (1942–46) and finally establishing in [[Venezuela]] in 1946 and becoming a Venezuelan citizen in 1952. He started teaching upon his arrival at the [[Central University of Venezuela]] in 1946 until his retirement in 1971. He won the [[National Prize for Literature (Venezuela)|National Prize for Literature]]  in 1978 for his life's work.

{{gnosticism}}
'''Jules-Benoît Stanislas Doinel du Val-Michel''' (December 8, 1842, [[Moulins, Allier]] &amp;ndash; March 16 or 17, 1903), also simply '''Jules Doinel''', was an archivist and the founder of the first [[Gnosticism in modern times|Gnostic church]] in modern times.

==Gnostic Church Revival==

After spiritual experiences in 1888-89, he proclaimed 1890 the beginning of "the era of Gnosis restored." Doinel assumed the office of Patriarch of the ''[[Église Gnostique]]'' ([[French Language|French]]: ''Gnostic Church''), taking the ecclesiastical name of '''Tau Valentin II''', after [[Valentinius]], the 2nd century Christian Gnostic teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPearsWiccal|Pearson, J. (2007) p. 46]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWaiteDevil|Waite (1896) p. 185]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrinal orientation of the church was based on extant Cathar documents, with the Gospel of John, and strong influence of [[Simon Magus|Simonian]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]] [[cosmology]], the church was officially established in the [[autumn]] of 1890 in [[Paris (France)|Paris, France]]. Liturgical services were based on Cathar rituals. Clergy were both male and female, having male bishops and female "sophias."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHoellGnos|Hoeller (2002) p. 176-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Doinel was "spiritually consecrated" in a spiritual experience in 1888 and not into a line of [[apostolic succession]]. Doinel subsequently consecrated a number of bishops for the ''Église Gnostique'', notable among these was [[Gérard Encausse]] founder of the closely allied [[Martinist Order]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPearsWiccal|Pearson, J. (2007) p. 47]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHoellGnos|Hoeller (2002) p. 177]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Masonic Period (1895-1897)==

In 1895, Doinel resigned from the ''Église Gnostique'', leaving the leadership of the church to a council of bishops. Doinel then converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and began a collaboration with [[Léo Taxil]], one of many taken in  by Taxil's [[Taxil hoax|anti-masonic hoax]].  Doinel wrote a book entitled ''Lucifer Unmasked'', a book attacking freemasonry, under the name '''Jean Kostka''', in which he associated many of his prior activities with the diabolic. [[A. E. Waite]] described ''Lucifer Unmasked'' and revealed the real identity of its author in  ''Devil Worship in France'' his exposé of the anti-masonic movement Taxil inspired.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWaiteDevil|Waite (1896) p. 184]]&lt;/ref&gt; Taxil unveiled his hoax in 1897.

==Reconciliation==

Doinel was readmitted as a bishop in the ''Église Gnostique'' in 1900.

[[File:The Ego and Its Own - Tsuji Jun translation.jpg|thumb|The cover of Jun Tsuji's translated edition of ''The Ego and Its Own''.]]
{{nihongo|'''Jun Tsuji''', later Ryūkitsu Mizushima |[[:ja:辻潤|辻 潤]]|Tsuji Jun|extra=October 4, 1884 &amp;ndash; November 24, 1944}}, was a [[Japanese author]]: a [[poet]], [[essay]]ist, [[playwright]], and [[translator]].  He has also been described as a [[Dada]]ist, [[nihilism|nihilist]], [[Epicurean]], [[shakuhachi]] [[music]]ian, [[actor]], [[feminist]], and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]]. He [[translation|translated]] [[Max Stirner]]'s ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' and [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s ''The Man of Genius'' into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

[[Tōkyō]]-born Tsuji Jun sought escape in literature from a childhood he described as "nothing but destitution, hardship, and a series of traumatizing difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 1. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became interested in the works of [[Tolstoy]], [[Kōtoku Shūsui]]'s [[socialist anarchism]], and the literature of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Voltaire]], among many others.  Later, in 1920 Tsuji was introduced to Dada and became a self-proclaimed first Dadaist of Japan, a title also claimed by Tsuji's contemporary, [[Shinkichi Takahashi]].  Tsuji became a fervent proponent of [[Stirnerite]] [[egoist anarchism]], which would become a point of contention between himself and Takahashi.  He wrote one of the prologues for famed [[feminist]] poet [[Fumiko Hayashi (author)|Hayashi Fumiko]]'s 1929 ({{nihongo|''I Saw a Pale Horse''|蒼馬を見たり|''Ao Uma wo Mitari''}} and was active in the radical artistic circles of his time.

==Individualist anarchism==
Tsuji was influenced by the philosophy of [[Epicurus]], and many characteristics of [[Epicureanism]] show through his lifestyle.  For example, Tsuji avoided active engagement in politics and sought after a form of [[ataraxia]], which he was apparently able to experience through vagabond wandering and [[egotism|Egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 1. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also spent his time primarily trying to enjoy a simple life free of suffering (see [[Aponia]]).&lt;ref&gt;1993.  Setouchi, Harumi. ''Beauty in disarray''. Rutland, VT: Charles E. Tuttle.&lt;/ref&gt;  While his writings themselves are significant, it seems Tsuji's own emphasis was on developing an experimental, liberated lifestyle.  Most of Tsuji's writings describe the philosophy behind this, as well as the personal process Tsuji went through towards this aim.  As [[Hagiwara Kyōjirō]] ([[:ja:萩原恭次郎|萩原 恭次郎]]) wrote, “Tsuji chose not to express himself with a pen so much as he chose to express himself through living, as conveyed by his personality.  That is, Tsuji himself was his expression's piece of work”.&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 9. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is no coincidence that this resembles the [[Egoist anarchism]] described by [[Max Stirner]], who seems to be the most influential philosopher in Tsuji's development.

==''Death of an Epicurean''==
One notable play written by Tsuji is the dadaist/absurdist  {{nihongo|''Death of an Epicurean''|享楽主義者の死|Kyōraku-shugi-sha no Shi}}, in which a figure must confront [[Panta rhei (Heraclitus)|Panta Rhei]] ({{lang-grc|Πάντα ῥεῖ|}}), or the transient nature of all things.  Tsuji saw the concept of Panta Rhei to be related to Stirner's [[Creative Nothing]], wherein it is because of the nihility of all things that there is potential for creativity and change.  Tsuji also found this relevant to the Buddhist concept of nothingness,&lt;ref&gt;2001.  Hackner, Thomas. ''Dada und Futurismus in Japan: die Rezeption der historischen Avantgarden''. München: Iudicium.  98.&lt;/ref&gt;  sometimes translated as [[Mu (negative)|mu]].

In ''Death of an Epicurean'', Tsuji comments on the destruction of the [[Ryōunkaku]] (Cloud-surpassing Tower) in the area of Tokyo he often called home, [[Asakusa]].  This building was a [[skyscraper]] that had become very much a symbol of modernity in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;2005.  Ambaras, David Richard. ''Bad youth: juvenile delinquency and the politics of everyday life in modern Japan.'' Studies of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and its destruction in the 1923 [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] came as a harrowing omen to many who saw it as reminiscent of the [[Tower of Babel]].  This symbol would become a popular one in literature, used by such authors as [[Ishikawa Takuboku]].&lt;ref&gt;1985.  Ishikawa, Takuboku, Sanford Goldstein, Seishi Shinoda, and Takuboku Ishikawa. ''Romaji diary ; and, Sad toys.'' Rutland, Vt: C.E. Tuttle Co.  125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in the wake of this event, Tsuji's ''Death of an Epicurean'' reads:
{{quote|The tower in Asakusa was burnt in columns of fire and from their ashes came the young 'Varieté d' Epicure.'  Saddled with the grief of the notion that 'All things are in flux,' children who have used rouge and powder are playing tambourines and castanets.  Just chant the incantation 'Panta rhei' and bless the lips and thighs of the young men.&lt;ref&gt;1998.  Omuka, Toshiharu, and Stephen Foster, ed. “Tada=Dada (Devotedly Dada) for the Stage”.  ''The Eastern Dada orbit: Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Central Europe and Japan. Crisis and the arts : the history of Dada'' Stephen C. Foster, general ed, vol. 4. New York: Hall [u.a.]. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this passage Tsuji describes the birth of an Epicurean out of someone who experienced the transience of such eternal-seeming icons as the [[Ryōunkaku]] and greater Tokyo.  The Epicurean is portrayed here as someone who, in their despair, embraces the Arts in response to tragic ephemerality.  For Tsuji, whose residence was reduced by the earthquake to a "monster right out of [[Cubism]]",&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. "Humoresque". ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 1. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000159/card852.html&lt;/ref&gt; this passage comes off as autobiographical, describing his own turn to revelling in [[Epicureanism]] and [[the Arts]].

==Censorship and vagabondage==
Tsuji wrote during the 1920s, a dangerous period in Japanese history for controversial writers, during which he experienced the wages of censorship through police harassment.  He also experienced this vicariously through the persecution of close associates such as his former wife, [[anarcho-feminist]] [[Itō Noe]], who was murdered in the [[Amakasu Incident]].

For being a controversial writer in the heart of Tokyo's radical art scene, Tsuji himself believed that had he been living instead as a peasant in the Soviet Union at the time, he would surely have been shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 1. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  This political climate exacerbated Tsuji's urges towards vagabondage:

{{Quotation|That I, without an objective and completely light-heartedly, walk&amp;nbsp;– having unawares become absorbed in the winds and water and grass among other things in nature, it is not unusual for my existence to become suspicious.  And because my existence is in such a suspicious position, I am flying off from this society and vanishing.  In such circumstances there is a possibility of feeling the "vagabond's religious ecstasy".  At such times one may become utterly lost in their experience.  Thus, when I set myself to putting something down on paper, at last feelings from those moments drift into my mind, and I am compelled to make these feelings known.

When I am driven to write, it is already too late and I become an utterly shackled captive&amp;nbsp;... Thus, after writing and garrulously chatting I often feel I have surely done something tremendously pointless.  This results in me lacking the spirit to write.  Nevertheless, thus far and from here on out, I have written, will continue to write.

My impulse to wander comes about from the uneasiness of staying still&amp;nbsp;... and this uneasiness is for me quite dreadful.|Tsuji Jun, ''Vagabond Romance''. July 29, 1921&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 1. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 24–25. http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000159/files/850.html　{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Institutionalization, Buddhist renunciation, and death==

In 1932 Tsuji was institutionalized in a [[psychiatric hospital]] after what would become popularly known as the "[[Tengu]] Incident".&lt;ref&gt;1932.  "Tsuji Jun Shi Tengu ni Naru", ''Yomiuri Shimbun'' (Newspaper), April 11th Morning Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some accounts, one night during a party at a friend's residence, Tsuji climbed to the second floor and began flapping his arms crying "I am the [[Tengu]]!", eventually jumping from the building, running around, and jumping onto the table calling "kyaaaaaa, kyaaaa!!"&lt;ref&gt;1971.  Tamagawa, Nobuaki.  ''Tsuji Jun hyōden''. Tōkyō: San'ichi Shobō.  270.&lt;/ref&gt;

After hospitalization, Tsuji was diagnosed as having experienced a temporary psychosis probably resulting from his chronic [[alcoholism]].  During this hospitalization Tsuji came to idealize the Buddhist monk [[Shinran]] and read the [[Tannishō]] many times over.&lt;ref&gt;1982.  Tsuji, Jun ed. Nobuaki Tamagawa. ''Tsuji Jun Zenshū'', v. 3. Tokyo: Gogatsushobo. 153. http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000159/files/851.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter the once prolific Tsuji gave up his writing career, and he returned to his custom of vagabondage in the fashion of a [[Komusō]] [[monk]], apparently as a sort of [[Nekkhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;1949.  ''Shinchō'', v. 80. Tokyo: Shinchōsha.  310.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next few years Tsuji fell into various incidents with police and was readmitted to mental hospitals several times.  At the age of 41 Tsuji suffered a major [[asthma]] attack and after hospitalization became weighed down with substantial hospital bills. While book royalties and a sort of {{nihongo|"Tsuji Jun Fan Club"|辻潤後援会|Tsuji Jun kōenkai}} provided some economic support, Tsuji was caught up in a harsh late [[World War II]] economic environment and spent the last few years of his life in vagabond [[poverty]].  Tsuji often made ends meet by going door to door as a [[busking]] [[shakuhachi]] musician.

However, in 1944, Tsuji settled down in a friend's one-bedroom apartment in Tokyo, where he was found dead from [[Starvation|starvation.]]

Tsuji is now buried in Tokyo's Saifuku Temple.&lt;ref&gt;1971.  Tamagawa, Nobuaki. ''Tsuji Jun Hyōden''. Tōkyō: Sanʻichi Shobō. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Tsuji is remembered for having helped found Dadaism in Japan along with contemporaries such as [[Murayama Tomoyoshi]], MAVO, [[Yoshiyuki Eisuke]], and [[Takahashi Shinkichi]].  Moreover, he was one of the most prominent Japanese contributors to Nihilist philosophy prior to [[World War II]].  He is also remembered as the father of prominent Japanese painter, Makoto Tsuji ([[:ja:辻まこと|辻 まこと]]).

Tsuji was depicted in the 1969 film ''[[Eros + Massacre]]'' and has been the subject of several Japanese books and articles.  Tsuji's friend and contemporary anarchist, [[Hagiwara Kyōjirō]], described Tsuji as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This person, "Tsuji Jun", is the most interesting figure in Japan today&amp;nbsp;...  He is like a commandment-breaking monk, like Christ&amp;nbsp;...

Vagrants and labourers of the town gather about him.  The defeated unemployed and the penniless find in him their own home and religion&amp;nbsp;... his disciples are the hungry and the poor of the world.  Surrounded by these disciples he passionately preaches the Good News of Nihilism.  But he is not Christlike, and he preaches but drunken nonsense.  Then the disciples call him merely "Tsuji" without respect and sometimes hit him on the head.  This is a strange religion&amp;nbsp;...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But here Tsuji has regrettably been portrayed as a religious character.  It sounds contradictory, but Tsuji is a religious man without a religion&amp;nbsp;... As art is not a religion, neither is Tsuji's life religious.  But in a sense it is&amp;nbsp;... Tsuji calls himself an ''Unmensch''&amp;nbsp;... If Nietzsche's Zarathustra is religious&amp;nbsp;... then Tsuji's teaching would be a better religion than Nietzsche's, for Tsuji lives in accord with his principles as himself&amp;nbsp;... 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tsuji is a sacrifice of modern culture... In the Japanese literary world Tsuji can be considered a rebel.  But this is not because he is a drunkard, nor because he lacks manners, nor because he is an anarchist.  It is because he puts forth his dirty ironies as boldly as a bandit&amp;nbsp;... Tsuji himself is very shy and timid in person&amp;nbsp;... but his clarity and self-respect exposes the falsities of the famous in the literary world&amp;nbsp;... [though] to many he really comes across as an anarchistic rogue&amp;nbsp;...

The literary world only sees him as having been born in this world to provide a source for gossip, but he is like Chaplin producing seeds of humour in their rumours&amp;nbsp;... The common Japanese literati do not understand that the laugh of Chaplin is a contradictory tragedy&amp;nbsp;... In a society of base, closed-minded people idealists are always taken as madmen or clowns.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tsuji Jun is always drunk.  If he doesn't drink he can't stand the suffering and sorrow of life.  On the rare occasion he is sober&amp;nbsp;... he does look the part of an incompetent and ''Unmensch''-ian fool.  Then his faithful disciples bring him saké in place of a ceremonial offering, pour electricity back into his robot heart, and wait for him to start moving... In this way the teaching of the ''Unmensch begins''.  It is a religion for the weak, the proletariat, the egoists, and those of broken personalities, and at the same time&amp;nbsp;– it is a most pure, a most sorrowful religion for modern intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;1982.

University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 1870 – June 7, 1945}} was a prominent Japanese [[philosopher]], founder of what has been called the [[Kyoto School]] of philosophy. He graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] during the [[Meiji period]] in 1894 with a degree in [[philosophy]]. He was named [[professor]] of the Fourth Higher School in [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] in 1899 and later became professor of philosophy at [[Kyoto University]]. Nishida retired in 1927. In 1940, he was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] (文化勲章, ''bunka kunshō''). He participated in establishing the [[Chiba Institute of Technology]] (千葉工業大学) from 1940.

Nishida Kitarō died at the age of 75 of a [[renal]] [[infection]]. His cremated remains were divided in three and buried at different locations. Part of his remains was buried in the Nishida family grave in his birthplace [[Unoke, Ishikawa]]. A second grave can be found at [[Tōkei-ji]] Temple in [[Kamakura]], where his friend [[D. T. Suzuki]] organized Nishida's funeral and was later also buried in the adjacent plot. Nishida's third grave is at Reiun'in (霊雲院, ''Reiun'in''), a [[temple]] in the [[Myōshin-ji]] compound in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Yusa Michiko. [https://books.google.pl/books?id=OUaOOd3ljdQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kitaro+Nishida&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxK1VPO0JoL-ygPjoIDYDQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false''Zen &amp; Philosophy: An Intellectual Biography of Nishida Kitaro'']. University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Being born in the third year of the [[Meiji period]], Nishida was presented with a new, unique opportunity to contemplate [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophical]] issues in the fresh light that [[Western philosophy]] shone on them. Nishida's original and creative philosophy, incorporating ideas of [[Zen]] and Western philosophy, was aimed at bringing the East and West closer. Throughout his lifetime, Nishida published a number of books and essays including ''[[An Inquiry into the Good]]'' and "The Logic of the Place of Nothingness and the Religious Worldview." Taken as a whole, Nishida’s life work was the foundation for the [[Kyoto School]] of philosophy and the inspiration for the original thinking of his disciples.

The most famous concept in Nishida's philosophy is the logic of basho (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as "place" or "[[wikt:topos|topos]]"), a non-dualistic concrete logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject–object distinction essential to the subject logic of [[Aristotle]] and the predicate logic of [[Immanuel Kant]], through the affirmation of what he calls the "absolutely contradictory self-identity", a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the [[Dialectics|dialectical logic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.

When David A. Dilworth wrote about Nishida’s work, he did not mention the debut book in his useful classification. In his book ''Zen no kenkyū'' ([[An Inquiry into the Good]]), Nishida writes about experience, reality, good and religion. He argues that the most profound form of experience is the pure experience. Nishida analyzes the thought, the will, the intellectual intuition and the pure experience among them.&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, Kitarō (1980), ''Zen no kenkyū'' [[An Inquiry into the Good]], Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nishida’s vision as well as to the essence of Asian wisdom, one craves harmony in experience, for unity.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2005), ''Nishida Kitarō. O cercetare asupra binelui'', Braşov: Orientul latin, page 240 {{ISBN|973-9338-77-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Masao Abe, "During [[World War II]] right wing thinkers attacked him as antinationalistic for his appreciation of [[Western philosophy]] and logic. But after the war left wing thinkers criticized his philosophy as nationalistic because of his emphasis on the traditional notion of ''[[nothingness]]''. He recognized a kind of universality in Western philosophy and logic but did not accept that it was the only universality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abe|first=Maso|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=An Inquiry Into the Good |year=1987|publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-05233-6 |page=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matteo Motterlini''' (born January 6, 1967) is an Italian [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[Behavioral economics|behavioral]] and [[neuroeconomics|neuroeconomist]]. He  teaches at [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University]] of Milan, Italy.

== Academic career and publications ==

Currently Adviser for Social and Behavioral Sciences for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers in Italy (appointed 5th May 2016)

Motterlini holds graduate degrees in Logic &amp; Scientific Method and Economics from [[The London School of Economics and Political Science]]. He held teaching and research positions at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (Dept. of Social and Decision Sciences, 1999-2000) and [[University of California Los Angeles]] (Dept. of Psychology, 2011-2012).

He is perhaps best known for his contribution to the field of philosophy of science and the history of ideas, mainly to the issue of the rationality of science  and the debate “for and against method” with respect to the philosophical ideas of [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul K. Feyerabend]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368102000249 Motterlini M., (2002), "Recostructing Lakatos: a reassessment of Lakatos’ epistemological project in the light of the Lakatos Archive", Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A, 33, 3, 497, 509]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the original material in the Lakatos Archive, he edited ''For and Against Method'' (1999, University of Chicago Press), including Lakatos's Lectures on Scientific Method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend Correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0226467759 Motterlini M.

The '''Pahlavi Psalter''' is the name given to a 12-page non-contiguous section of a [[Middle Persian]] translation of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the   [[Book of Psalms]].

The Pahlavi Psalter was discovered in 1905 by the second German Turpan expedition under [[Albert von Le Coq]].
Together with a mass of other fragmentary Christian manuscripts discovered in the ruins of the library of Shui-pang at [[Bulayiq]] (near Turpan, in what is today the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]), the documents were sent to [[Berlin]] for analysis, where the fragments remain today.

The Pahlavi Psalter is the oldest surviving example of [[Pahlavi literature]], that is, literature composed using the [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi writing system]]. The surviving fragments probably date to the 6th or 7th century CE. The translation itself dates to not before the mid-6th century since it reflects liturgical additions to the Syriac original by [[Mar Aba I]], who was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]] ''c.'' 540 - 552.&lt;!-- (''cf.'' Andreas, 1910:869-872)--&gt;

The script of the psalter, like that of all other examples of Pahlavi literature, is also an [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic-derived script]] (see [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] for details). However, unlike [[Book Pahlavi]] script, which is a later but more common form of the consonantary and has 12 or 13 [[grapheme]]s, the script of the psalms has 5 symbols more. The variant of the script used for the psalter was for almost a century the only evidence of that specific variant, which consequently came to be referred to as [[Psalter Pahlavi]] script. More recently however, another sample of the writing was discovered in the inscriptions on a bronze processional cross found at [[Herat]] (in present-day [[Afghanistan]]). Due to the dearth of comparable material, some words and phrases in both sources remain undeciphered.

[[File:Pascal - Pensées, édition de Port-Royal, 1670.djvu|thumb|Second edition of [[Blaise Pascal]]'s ''Pensées'', 1670]]

The '''''Pensées''''' ("Thoughts") is a collection of fragments on [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] written by [[17th-century philosophy|17th-century philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal's [[religious conversion]] led him into a life of [[asceticism]], and the ''Pensées'' was in many ways his life's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbD0B2HcTn4C&amp;pg=PA155|page=155|title=History of Philosophy: Descartes to Leibniz|isbn=0809100681|first=Frederick Charles|last=Copleston|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pensées'' represented Pascal's defense of the [[Christian religion]]. The concept of "[[Pascal's Wager]]" stems from a portion of this work.&lt;ref name="hammond"/&gt;

==Publication history==
The ''Pensées'' is the name given posthumously to fragments that Pascal had been preparing for an [[Christian apologetics|apology]] for Christianity, which was never completed. That envisioned work is often referred to as the ''Apology for the Christian Religion'', although Pascal never used that title.{{sfn|Krailsheimer|1995|p=xviii}}

Although the ''Pensées'' appears to consist of ideas and jottings, some of which are incomplete, it is believed that Pascal had, prior to his death in 1662, already planned out the order of the book and had begun the task of cutting and pasting his draft notes into a coherent form. His task incomplete, subsequent editors have disagreed on the order, if any, in which his writings should be read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal/ Blaise Pascal], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (accessed 2010-03-11)&lt;/ref&gt; Those responsible for his effects, failing to recognize the basic structure of the work, handed them over to be edited, and they were published in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=A.J.|last=Krailsheimer|chapter=Introduction|work=Pensées|year=1995|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0140446451|page=x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first English translation was made in 1688 by John Walker.&lt;ref&gt;Daston, Lorraine. ''Classical Probability in the Enlightenment''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Another English translation by W. F. Trotter was published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-0.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pascal's Pensées, by Blaise Pascal] (accessed 2014-10-06)&lt;/ref&gt; The proper order of the ''Pensées'' is heavily disputed.&lt;ref name="hammond"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Blaise Pascal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ognCKztR8a4C&amp;pg=PA518|page=518|first=Nicholas|last=Hammond|title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought|editor=Hastings|year=2000|isbn=9780198600244|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts have been made to arrange the notes systematically; notable editions include those of [[Léon Brunschvicg]], [[Jacques Chevalier]], [[Louis Lafuma]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt; and (more recently) [[w:fr:Philippe Sellier|Philippe Sellier]]. Although Brunschvicg tried to classify the posthumous fragments according to themes, recent research has prompted Sellier to choose entirely different classifications, as Pascal often examined the same event or example through many different lenses. Also noteworthy is the monumental edition of Pascal's ''Œuvres complètes'' (1964&amp;ndash;1992), which is known as the Tercentenary Edition and was realized by [[Jean Mesnard]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Rien ne nous plaît que le combat": la campagne des Provinciales de Pascal|volume=1|first=Olivier|last=Jouslin|publisher=Presses Univ Blaise Pascal|year=2007|page=781}}&lt;/ref&gt; although still incomplete, this edition reviews the dating, history and critical bibliography of each of Pascal's texts.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular various works by Laurent Thirouin, for example “Les premières liasses des Pensées : architecture et signification”, XVIIe siècle, n°177 (spécial Pascal), oct./déc. 1992, pp. 451-468 or “Le cycle du divertissement, dans les liasses classées”, ''Giornata di Studi Francesi'', “Les Pensées de Pascal : du dessein à l’édition”, Rome, Université LUMSA, 11-12 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Albert Railton''' (born May 23, 1950) is an American [[philosopher]] who is Gregory S. Kavka Distinguished University Professor and John Stephenson Perrin Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], where he has taught since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/philosophy/Home/People/Faculty/Railton%20CV-Curr-April%202013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208232410/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/philosophy/Home/People/Faculty/Railton%20CV-Curr-April%202013.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also been a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Princeton University]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0304/May10_04/08.shtml 4 U-M scholars named AAAS fellows&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==

He received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1980, writing a dissertation under the supervision of [[David K. Lewis]]. Although his dissertation concerned scientific explanation, on which he has published several articles, his main research since centers on contemporary [[metaethics]] and [[normative ethics]], especially [[consequentialism]]. He is the author of the book ''Facts, Norms, and Values'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), a collection of his major papers in ethics, and a co-editor (with [[Stephen Darwall]] and [[Allan Gibbard]]) of ''Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).

A public lecture he gave concerning his own struggles with depression attracted widespread notice and praise in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/25/professors-reflections-his-battle-depression-touch-many-recent-disciplinary-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral Realism==

Railton has playfully described himself as a "stark, raving moral realist".&lt;ref&gt;
"Moral Realism", ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 95, No. 2 (April 1986), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike some moral realists, he thinks moral facts that make moral statements true are natural facts.

'''Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa''' is a mythical monkey-ancestor of the Tibetan people. With [[King Gesar]] and [[Avalokiteśvara]], of whom he is an incarnation, he is one of the most important figures in Tibetan culture.&lt;ref&gt;The myth is attested in the book [[Maṇi bka' 'bum]], allotted to{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} King [[Songtsen Gampo]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pha'' means "father", ''Trelgen'' "old monkey" and ''Changchup Sempa'' refers to the [[bodhisattva]] (''Changchub'' meaning "enlightenment" and ''Sempa'' meaning "intention").

== Birth of the first Tibetans ==

A very popular Tibetan creation myth holds that in the beginning the world was covered by water, which evaporated little by little, leaving room for animal life. To the flooded land of Tibet came a monkey that had withdrawn there to immerse himself in meditation and to follow a life of asceticism and chastity. He settled on [[Zodang Gongpori|Mount Gongori]]. One day, while he sat in meditation, a female demon came to seduce him. Tradition has it that she was the manifestation of the bodhisattva [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] (''Jetsun Dolma'' in Tibetan), a symbol of compassion and protector of merchants and travelers. She threatened that if he refused to sleep with her she would visit a demon and conceive a multitude of small monsters that would destroy all living creatures. The wise monkey yielded and requested [[Avalokiteśvara]]'s authorization to marry her. Avalokiteśvara blessed the monkey and the female demon, and a few months later six small monkeys were born of their union. The monkey let his six children grow up in the forest, but three years later he discovered that they had become five hundred. The fruits of the forest were no longer sufficient to feed them, and the five hundred monkeys beseeched their father to help them find food. Not knowing what to do, he went again to ask help from the god of compassion. Then Avalokiteśvara went on the mount Meru, or [[Sumeru]] (believed to correspond to today's [[Mount Kailash]]), a sacred place for Buddhists, Hindus, [[Jainism|Jains]] and [[Bönpo]]. Some say that at the top of the mountain he gathered a handful of barley, others that he extracted five cereals from his own body to offer to the monkey father. Then the monkey father learned agriculture and, after a good harvest, could finally feed all his children. As they fed on the cereals, the monkeys gradually lost their hair and their tails. They also started to use bone and stone implements, then made clothes and built houses, forming a civilization from which the Tibetan people descended.

== Another version ==

Another account says that, seeing the world peopled by demons, Avalokiteśvara the bodhisattva of compassion took pity on the Earth, incarnated himself as a monkey and mated with an ogress of the rock. From this union were born six monkeys, which represent the six principal clans of the Tibetan people.&lt;ref&gt;Khar, Rabgong Dorjee (1991).

{{Refimprove|date=August 2016}}
The '''problem of other minds''' is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following [[Epistemology|epistemological]] challenge raised by the [[Skepticism|skeptic]]: given that I can only observe the [[behavior]] of others, how can I know that others have [[mind]]s?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/|first=Alec|last=Hyslop|title=Other Minds|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|editor2-last=Nodelman|editor2-first=Uri|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|issn=1095-5054|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as [[solipsism]]; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist. Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5577">A '''retronym''' is a [[neologism|newer name]] for an existing thing that differentiates the original form or version from a more recent one. It is thus a word created to differentiate between two types, whereas previously (before there were two types) no clarification was required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retronym&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advances in technology are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms. For example, the term "[[acoustic guitar]]" was coined at the advent of [[electric guitars]]&lt;ref name="safire2" /&gt; and [[analog watch]]es were thus renamed to distinguish them from [[digital watch]]es once the latter were invented.&lt;ref name="safire1"&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire  |authorlink=William Safire |coauthors= |title=Retronym Watch  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDB153AF932A35752C1A964958260 |quote= |work=New York Times Magazine |date=November 1, 1992 |accessdate=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]] platform was rebranded the "Atari 2600" (after its product code, CX-2600) in 1982 following the launch of its successor, the [[Atari 5200]], and all hardware and software related to the platform were released under this new branding from that point on.

==Word history==
The term ''retronym'', a [[neologism]] composed of the [[classical compound|combining forms]] ''[[wikt:retro-#Prefix|retro-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-nym#Suffix|-nym]]'', was coined by [[Frank Mankiewicz]] in 1980 and popularized by [[William Safire]] in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=safire2&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |coauthors= |title=Retronym |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_safire.t.html |quote=The Merriam lexies, always strong on etymology, cite the earliest usage they can find of retronym in this column in 1980, which credited Frank Mankiewicz, then president of National Public Radio, as the coiner. He was especially intrigued by the usage hardcover book, which was originally a plain book until softcover books came along, which were originally called paperback and now have spawned a version the size of a hardcover but with a soft cover trade-named with the retronym trade paperback. |work=New York Times Magazine |date=January 7, 2007 |accessdate=2015-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=safire2/&gt;&lt;ref name=safire1/&gt;

'''Richard G. Swinburne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɪ|n|b|ɜr|n}}; born 26 December 1934) is a British [[philosopher]]. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]]. Over the last 50 years Swinburne has been an influential proponent of philosophical arguments for the [[existence of God]]. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of ''The Coherence of Theism'', ''The Existence of God'', and ''Faith and Reason''.

==Academic career==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Swinburne received an Open Scholarship to study [[classics]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], but in fact graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class]] BA in philosophy, politics, and economics. 
Swinburne has held various professorships through his career in academia. From 1972 to 1985 he taught at [[Keele University]]. During part of this time, he gave the [[Gifford lectures]] at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] from 1982 to 1984, resulting in the book ''The Evolution of the Soul''.  From 1985 until his retirement in 2002 he was [[Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion]] at the University of Oxford (his successor in this chair is [[Brian Leftow]]). He has continued to publish regularly since his retirement.

Swinburne has been an active author throughout his career, producing a major book every two to three years.  He has played an important role in recent debate over the [[mind-body problem]], defending a [[substance dualism]] that recalls the work of [[René Descartes]] in important respects. See ''[[The Evolution of the Soul]]'', 1997.

His books are primarily very technical works of academic philosophy, but he has written at the popular level as well.  Of the non-technical works, his ''Is There a God?'' (1996), summarising for a non-specialist audience many of his [[arguments for the existence of God]] and plausibility in the belief of that existence, is probably the most popular, and is available in 22 languages.

==Christian apologetics==

A member of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], he is noted as one of the foremost [[Christian apologist]]s, arguing in his many articles and books that faith in Christianity is rational and coherent in a rigorous philosophical sense. [[William Hasker]] writes that his "tetralogy on Christian doctrine, together with his earlier trilogy on the philosophy of theism, is one of the most important apologetic projects of recent times."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, "Is Christianity Probable? Swinburne's Apologetic Programme," ''Religious Studies'' 38 (2002), 253.&lt;/ref&gt; While Swinburne presents many arguments to advance the belief that God exists, he argues that God is a being whose existence is not logically necessary (see [[modal logic]]), but metaphysically necessary in a way he defines in his ''The Christian God''. Other subjects on which Swinburne writes include [[personal identity]] (in which he espouses a view based on the concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]), and [[epistemic justification]]. He has written in defence of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] and [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mind, Brain, and Free Will'', 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he is best known for his vigorous rational defence of Christian intellectual commitments, he also has a theory of the nature of passionate faith which is developed in his book ''Faith and Reason''.

According to an interview Swinburne did with ''Foma'' magazine, he converted from [[Anglican Communion|Anglicanism]] ([[Church of England]]) to Eastern Orthodoxy around 1996:
:I don't think I changed my beliefs in any significant way. I always believed in the Apostolic succession: that the Church has to have its authority dating back to the Apostles, and the general teaching of the Orthodox Church on the saints and the prayers for the departed and so on, these things I have always believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foma.ru/article/index.php?news=2368&amp;sphrase_id=899158 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222214436/http://www.foma.ru/article/index.php?news=2368&amp;sphrase_id=899158 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinburne's philosophical method reflects the influence of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He admits that he draws from Aquinas a systematic approach to philosophical theology. Swinburne, like Aquinas, moves from basic philosophical issues (for example, the question of the possibility that God may exist in Swinburne's ''The Coherence of Theism''), to more specific Christian beliefs (for example, the claim in Swinburne's ''Revelation'' that God has communicated to human beings propositionally in Jesus Christ).

Swinburne moves in his writing program from the philosophical to the theological, building his case rigorously, and relying on his previous arguments as he defends particular Christian beliefs. He has attempted to reassert classical Christian beliefs with an apologetic method that he believes is compatible with contemporary science. That method relies heavily on inductive logic, seeking to show that his Christian beliefs fit best with the evidence.

[[National Life Stories]] conducted an oral history interview (C1672/15) with Richard Swinburne in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.&lt;ref name=oralhistory&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1672X0015XX-0001V0 National Life Stories, 'Swinburne, Richard (1 of 5) National Life Stories Collection: Science and Religion', The British Library Board, 2015].

'''Salvino Busuttil''' (born 1936) is a Maltese [[economist]], and [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he specialised in [[economics]] and [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Busuttil was born at [[Floriana]], [[Malta]], in 1936.

He studied [[philosophy]] at the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] from which he acquired a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in 1959. He acquired a Doctorate in Philosophy from the [[Angelicum University]] in [[Rome]] in 1961 with a dissertation entitled ''Value in Karl Marx ''.  In 1963 he earned a Doctorate in Economy from the [[University of Manchester]]. After returning to Malta Busuttil was appointed Professor and Head of the Department of [[Economics]] at the [[University of Malta]] in 1964, an office he held up till 1975. Two years later, in 1966, he was chosen as Head of the [[Faculty of Arts]] until 1972.

From 1987 till 1996 Busuttil was General Director of the Foundation of International Studies at the [[University of Malta]]. Both on a local as well as on an international level he occupied various positions of responsibility related to the [[economy]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]], especially with [[UNESCO]].

==Works==
Busuttil published various works. Some of them, like those dealing with purely economic matters, are not of direct interest to philosophy. Others, however, contain significant philosophical value. Amongst these one can find the following:

* 1963 - ''Value in Marx''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969 - ''Philosophical and Economical Foundations of the Marxian Theory of Value''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990 – A Note on Economic Responsibility Towards Future Generations (in ''Our Responsibilities Towards Future Generations'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1994 – Protecting Our Common Future (in ''What Future for Future Generations?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1994 – Foreword (in ''The Search for Peace in the Mediterranean Region'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1994 – The Role of Universities in the Quest for Peace in the Mediterranean (in ''The Search for Peace in the Mediterranean Region'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1998 – Preface (in ''Future Generations and International Law'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busuttil coedited a number of book of philosophical interest, namely:

* 1990 - ''Our Responsibilities Towards Future Generations'' (with [[Emmanuel Agius]], [[Peter Serracino Inglott]], and Tony Macelli).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1991 - ''Directions in the Study of Peace Education'' (with James Calleja, and Helena Kekkonen).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1994 - ''What Future for Future Generations?'' (with [[Emmanuel Agius]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidney Hook''' (December 20, 1902 – July 12, 1989) was an American [[philosophy|philosopher]] of the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] school known for his contributions to the [[philosophy of history]], the [[philosophy of education]], [[political philosophy|political theory]], and [[ethics]]. After embracing [[Communism]] in his youth, Hook was later known for his criticisms of [[totalitarianism]], both [[fascism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]]. A pragmatic [[social democracy|social democrat]], Hook sometimes cooperated with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], particularly in opposing [[Communism]]. After [[World War II]], he argued that members of such groups as the [[Communist Party USA]] and [[Leninists]] like [[Democratic centralism|Democratic centralists]] could ethically be barred from holding the offices of public trust because they called for the violent overthrow of [[democracy|democratic]] governments.

==Background==
[[File:Albert Einstein and others letter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Albert Einstein]], Sidney Hook et al. signed a 4 December 1948 letter published in the ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;

Sidney Hook was born on December 20, 1902, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], to Jennie and Isaac Hook, [[Austria]]n [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants.  He became a supporter of the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] during the [[Eugene V. Debs|Debs]] era when he was in high school. 

In 1923, he earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] at the [[City College of New York]] and in 1927 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Columbia University]], where he studied under [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[John Dewey]]. 

==Career==

In 1926, Hook became a professor of philosophy at [[New York University]] and, from 1948 to 1969, was head of the Department of Philosophy. He retired from the University in 1972.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}


In 1931, Hook began teaching at the [[New School for Social Research]] through 1936, after which he taught night school there until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

===Marxist===

At the beginning of his career, Hook was a prominent expert on [[Karl Marx]]'s philosophy and was himself a [[Marxism|Marxist]]. He attended the lectures of [[Karl Korsch]] in Berlin in 1928 and conducted research at the [[Marx-Engels Institute]] in [[Moscow]] in the summer of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Denning, ''The Cultural Front'', New York City: Verso, 1997, p. 425ff&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he wrote enthusiastically about the [[Soviet Union]], and, in 1932, supported the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]'s candidate, [[William Z. Foster]], when he ran for [[President of the United States]]. However, Hook broke completely with the [[Comintern]] in 1933, holding its policies responsible for the triumph of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]]. He accused [[Joseph Stalin]] of putting "the needs of the Russian state" over the needs of the international revolution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=86&amp;sortorder=issue&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hook remained active in some of the causes of the far Left during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, with [[James Burnham]], Hook was one of the organizers of the [[American Workers Party]], led by the Dutch-born [[pacifism|pacifist]] minister [[A.J. Muste]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Diggins, ''Up From Communism'', New York City: Columbia University Press, 1974, then Harper &amp; Row, 1975, pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; Hook also debated the meaning of Marxism with radical [[Max Eastman]] in a series of public exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, ''Up From Communism'', pp. 51-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastman, like Hook, had studied under John Dewey at Columbia University.  In the late 1930s, Hook assisted [[Leon Trotsky]] in his efforts to clear his name in a special [[Dewey Commission|Commission of Inquiry]] headed by Dewey, which investigated [[Stalinist]] charges made against Trotsky during the [[Moscow Trials]].

===Anti-Communist===

The [[Great Purge]] encouraged Hook's increasing ambivalence toward Marxism. In 1939, Hook formed the Committee for Cultural Freedom, a short-lived organization that set the stage for his postwar politics by opposing "totalitarianism" on the left and right. By the [[Cold War]], Hook had become a prominent [[Anti-Communism|anti-Communist]], although he continued to consider himself both a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and a [[secular humanist]] throughout his life. He was, therefore, an anti-Communist socialist. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=Precursors}}

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hook helped found Americans for Intellectual Freedom, the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), and the [[American Committee for Cultural Freedom]]. These bodies&amp;mdash;of which the CCF was most central&amp;mdash;were funded in part by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] through a variety of fronts and sought to dissuade American leftists from continuing to advocate cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]] as some had previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'shocked' treatment|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/dec/8/20051208-092510-1714r/|newspaper=Washington Times|date=December 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hook later wrote in his memoirs that he, "like almost everyone else," had heard that "the CIA was making some contribution to the financing of the Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Liberal Conspiracy: The Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Struggle for the Mind of Postwar Europe|last=Coleman|first=Peter|publisher=The Free Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1953, Hook discussed "The Threat to Academic Freedom" with [[Victor Riesel]] and others in the evening on [[WEVD]] radio (a Socialist radio station whose call letters referred to SPA founder [[Eugene V. Debs]]).&lt;ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Hook was a frequent critic of the [[New Left]]. He was opposed to  a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from the [[Vietnam War]] and defended California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]'s removal of [[Angela Davis]] from her professorship at [[UCLA]] because of her leadership role in the [[Communist Party USA]].

Hook was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended his career in the 1970s and 1980s as a fellow of the [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Hoover Institution]] in [[Stanford]], [[California]].

===Later years===

The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Hook for the 1984 [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E5D91538F935A15751C1A965948260 "Jefferson Humanities Speech to Be Given by Sidney Hook,"] ''The [[New York Times]]'', December 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hook's lecture was entitled "Education in Defense of a Free Society."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Web site (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlearchives.com/government/government-bodies-offices-us/600599-1.html "The Heroism of Sidney Hook,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306211822/http://www.articlearchives.com/government/government-bodies-offices-us/600599-1.html |date=2009-03-06 }} ''[[National Review]], June 15, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life and death===
Hook was a lifelong agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters of Sidney Hook: democracy, communism, and the cold war|year=1995|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=9781563244872|page=2|editor=Edward S. Shapiro|quote=This faith in rationality emerged early in Hook's life. Even before he was a teenager he proclaimed himself to be an agnostic. It was simply irrational, he declared, to believe in the existence of a merciful and powerful God in the face of widespread human misery. Only the pleadings of his parents that he not embarrass them in front of relatives and friends convinced Hook to participate in a Bar Mitzvah ceremony on his thirteenth birthday. People frequently asked him in his later years what he would say if he discovered after death that God really existed. He answered that he would simply state, "God, you never gave me enough evidence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Carrie Katz in 1924, with whom he had one son.  The couple separated in 1933.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;

There, she studied under [[Scott Nearing]] and came to write a chapter in his book ''The Law of Social Revolution'' entitled "The Russian Revolution of 1917" (1926).  Friends from the Rand School included Nerma Berman Oggins, wife of [[Cy Oggins]].  She was a Communist Party member who was a "Fosterite" (i.e., she supported [[William Z. Foster]] amidst Party factionalism in the last 1920s).  She went on to work at the [[Labor Defense Council]].&lt;ref&gt;

Hook died age 86 on  July 12, 1989, in Stanford, California.

==Awards==

* 1984: ''In Praise of Reason Award'' from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)]]. awarded  by CSICOP Chairman [[Paul Kurtz]]&lt;ref name="Hook award 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Facts and Fictions: On the Trail Of Paranormal Beliefs at CSICOP '84|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1985|volume=9|issue=3|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1985: [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] (May 23, 1985)

==Legacy==
{{Humanism}}

Hook's memoir, ''Out of Step'', recounts his life, his activism for a number of educational causes, his controversies with other intellectuals such as [[Noam Chomsky]], and his recollections of [[Mortimer J. Adler]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]], [[John Dewey]], [[Max Eastman]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, ''Out of Step'', New York City: Harper &amp; Row, chapters 5, 7, 23, 28, and 29, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, a conference marking the centennial of Hook's birth was organized by Matthew Cotter and [[Robert B. Talisse|Robert Talisse]] and held at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center in [[Manhattan]].

In April 2011 the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) (formerly known as CSICOP) again honored Hook.  At a meeting of its executive council in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] he was selected for inclusion in their Pantheon of Skeptics.

Sidney Hook's book ''The Hero in History'' was a noticeable event in the studies devoted to the role of the [[hero]], the [[Great Man theory|Great Man]] in history and the influence of people of significant accomplishments.

Hook opposed all forms of [[determinism]] and argued, as had [[William James]], that humans play a creative role in constructing the social world and to transforming their natural environment. Neither humanity nor its universe is determined or finished. For Hook this conviction was crucial. He argued that when a society is at the crossroads of choosing the direction of further development, an individual can play a dramatic role and even become an independent power on whom the choice of the historical pathway depends.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S., ''The Hero in History: A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, Masachuestts: Beacon Press, 1943, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Hook provided a great number of examples of the influence of great people, and the examples are mostly associated with various crucial moments in history, such as revolutions and crises. Some scholars have critically responded because, as one of them claims, &lt;blockquote&gt; he does not take into account that an individual's greatest influence can be revealed not so much in the period of the old regime's collapse, but in the formation period of a new one.... Besides, he did not make clear the situation when alternatives appear either as the result of a crisis or as the result of Great Man's plan or intention without [a] manifested crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]], ''The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution and History,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 2010, pp. 95–136, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hook introduced a theoretical division of historic personalities and especially leaders into the eventful man and the event-making man, depending on their influences on the historical process.&lt;ref&gt;''Professor Walter Earl Fluker Discusses Leadership, Obama and Civil Rights Pioneers'' {{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2009/February/20090227164810eaifas0.1341669.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206212240/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2009/February/20090227164810eaifas0.1341669.html |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he considers [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] as having been an event-making man, because of his having acted in an important circumstance to change the developmental direction not only of [[Russia]] but also of the whole world in the 20th century.

Hook attached great importance to accidents and contingencies in history&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S., ''The Hero in History: A Study in Limitation and Possibility'', Boston, Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;, thus opposing, among others, [[H. A. L. Fisher|Herbert Fisher]],&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, H., 1935. ''A History of Europe'', vol. I, London, p. vii (reprint Fontana Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; who made attempts to present history as "waves" of emergencies.

==="Ethics of Controversy"===
In 1954, Hook published an essay titled "The Ethics of Controversy," in which he set down ten ground rules for democratic discourse within a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ethics of Controversy," New Leader, February 1, 1954, republished in ''Sidney Hook on Pragmatism, Democracy and Freedom: The Essential Essays'', (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2002), edited by Robert Talilsse and Robert Tempio, pp. 292-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susanna Siegel''' is the Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy at [[Harvard University]] and well-known for her work in the philosophy of mind and epistemology, especially on perception.  

==Education and career==

Siegel received her B.A. in philosophy from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1991, before going on to receive a master's degree in philosophy from [[Yale University]] in 1993, a master's degree in philosophy from [[Cornell University]] in 1996, and a doctorate in philosophy from Cornell in 2000.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; From 1999 to 2004, 

Siegel served as assistant professor of philosophy at [[Harvard University]], receiving a secondary appointment as the John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Humanities before being promoted to full professor in 2005.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 2011, she was appointed the Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy,&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Susanna|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ssiegel/cv/cv6_03.html|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously held by [[B.F. Skinner]], [[Willard van Orman Quine]], and [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]]

In 2011 she was Walter Channing Cabot Fellow. She has held visiting appointments at Birmingham, where she is Distinguished Visiting Researcher from 2014-2017, and the University of Oslo, where she holds a part-time appointment as a visiting researcher. She has also given the Gareth Evans Memorial Lecture at Oxford, The [[Tamara Horowitz]] Memorial Lecture at Pittsburgh, and the Burman Lectures in Umea, Sweden.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Siegel is best known for her work in the philosophy of perception and epistemology. Her work is discussed critically and influenced many subsequent discussions of the contents of experience.

She has authored one monograph titled ''The Contents of Visual Experience,'' and has edited an anthology titled ''The Elements of Philosophy: Readings from Past and Present,'' in addition to publishing a number of chapters and peer reviewed journal articles.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She also writes and maintains the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'s article ''The Contents of Perception.''  Her monograph was well received,&lt;ref name=ndpr/&gt;&lt;ref name=mind/&gt; and her papers have been widely cited. Siegel has been photographed by the American Photographer Steve Pyke&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Pyke]]&lt;/ref&gt; and she appears on the cover of Steven Pyke's photographic anthology of important contemporary philosophers&lt;ref&gt;http://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophers-9780199757145;jsessionid=C464C8753E6A7BCC44092BDEC1A97AE3?cc=no&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ned Block]] described Siegel's ''The Contents of Visual Experience'' as "one of the most significant books in philosophy of mind for many years."&lt;ref name=monograph&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Susanna|title=The contents of visual experience|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199931248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Genone]] hailed ''The Contents of Visual Experience'' as "an important contribution to the contemporary literature on the nature and structure of perception," and lauded Siegel for being one of the first recent philosophers to challenge the prevailing view that perceptual experiences have representational contents, suggesting that if Siegel is correct in her views, the result would be a [[Sea change (idiom)|sea change]] that would effect not only the philosophy of perceptual experiences, but also have broad implications for many other areas of philosophy.&lt;ref name=ndpr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genone|first=James|title=Susanna Siegel, The Contents of Visual Experience, Oxford University Press, 2010, 222pp., $49.95 (hbk), ISBN 9780195305296|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Review|date=7 June 2011|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24721/|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early portion of Siegel's book constructs and contrasts two opposing views, one that she deems the "Content View," and one that she describes as the "Rich Content View."&lt;ref name=ndpr/&gt; The "Content View" represents a situation in which there is precision in the way in which perceptual experiences have meaningful contents, whereas in the "Rich Content View" perceptual experiences consist of simple and complex properties that humans extrapolate meaning from.&lt;ref name=ndpr/&gt;  Having established this framework, Siegel uses it to examine three major philosophical points: first, that humans are able to determine content from sensory cues (in what Siegel describes as 'the method of phenomenal contrast,") second, that the method of phenomenal contrast supports the idea of the Rich Content model as an enhancement over the Content model, and lastly that while ordinary visual experiences involve seeing things that pertain to objects in addition to seeing things that do not pertain to objects, hallucinations differ from standard visual experiences by only perceiving things that do not pertain to particular objects.&lt;ref name=mind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logue|first=H.|title=The Contents of Visual Experience, by Susanna Siegel|journal=Mind|date=13 December 2012|volume=121|issue=483|pages=842–849|doi=10.1093/mind/fzs089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So called "ill-founded" influences or transitions can diminish the epistemic value of the resulting experience. This upturns the traditional philosophical emphasis on perceptual experience as epistemically foundational, capable of justifying beliefs without itself being susceptible to epistemic evaluation in terms of rationality.

'''Theodore de Laguna''' (July 22, 1876 – 1930) was an [[American philosopher]] who taught for years at [[Bryn Mawr College]] and was known as an early feminist.

==Biography==
He was the son of Alexandro Francisco Lopez de Leo de Laguna, a French-U.S. academic who was born in upper [[Normandy]], [[France]], and was of Italian and Jewish ancestry, and Fredericke Bergner, the daughter of refugees from the 1848 revolution in [[Germany]].

His mother died young, and he was raised by an aunt, Frederica.

He received a B.A. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1896, an M.A. in 1899, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Cornell University]].

In 1901 he volunteered as a teacher in the [[Philippines]] in the aftermath of the [[Spanish–American War]].

Upon his return he taught at [[Cornell]], where he met and married a Ph.D. student, [[Grace de Laguna|Grace Mead Andrus]].  In 1907 Theodore and Grace both began teaching philosophy at [[Bryn Mawr College]].

In 1905, he accepted a position as a professor at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of the University of Michigan'' by Burke Aaron Hinsdale, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1930.

His children included the anthropologist [[Frederica de Laguna]]. Karyme Moraleta

'''Vazgen I''' also '''Vazken I of Bucharest''', ({{Lang-hy|Վազգէն Ա Բուխարեստցի}}), born '''Levon Garabed Baljian''' ({{lang-hy|Լևոն Կարապետ Աբրահամի Պալճյան}}; September 20, 1908 – August 18, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/624235/Vazgen-I|title=Vazgen I|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]] between 1955 and 1994, for a total of 39 years, the [[List of Catholicoi of Armenia|4th longest reign]] in the history of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

*Peter I (1019–1058) — Պետրոս Ա Գետադարձ (Catholicos of All Armenians),
*[[Gregory II the Martyrophile]] (1066–1105) — Գրիգոր Բ. Վկայասէր ([[List of Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia|Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia]]) and
*David IV (1590–1629), d. 1633 — Դավիթ Դ Վաղարշապատցի (Catholicos of All Armenians).
all served 39 years as Catholicos of All Armenians or [[List of Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia|Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia]], behind:

1) [[Nerses IV the Gracious|Nerses IV the Graceful]] (1166–1173) -- Սուրբ Ներսէս Դ. Կլայեցի (Շնորհալի), who served 53 years as Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia,&lt;br&gt;

2) [[Constantine I of Cilicia]] (1221–1267) -- Կոնստանդին Ա. Բարձրբերդցի, who served 46 years as Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia and &lt;br&gt;

3) [[Isaac of Armenia|St. Sahak I]] (387–428) -- Սբ. Սահակ Ա Պարթև, who served 41 years as Catholicos of All Armenians. 

A native of Romania, he began his career as a philosopher, before becoming a [[Doctor of Theology]] and a member of the local Armenian clergy. The leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church hierarchy in Romania, he became Catholicos in 1955, moving to the [[Soviet Union]] and residing in the [[Armenian SSR]]. Vazgen I led the Armenian Church during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and was the first Catholicos in newly independent Armenia.

==Biography==
Vazgen was born in [[Bucharest]] to a family belonging to the [[Armenians of Romania|Armenian-Romanian community]]. His father was a shoemaker and his mother was a schoolteacher. The young Levon Baljian did not initially pursue the Church as a profession, instead graduating from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. After graduation, he became a philosopher and published a series of scholarly articles.

As his interests began to shift from philosophy to theology, Baljian studied Armenian Apostolic Theology and Divinity in [[Athens]], Greece. He eventually gained the title of ''vardapet'', an ecclesiastical rank for learned preachers and teachers in the Armenian Apostolic Church roughly equivalent to receiving a doctorate in theology. In the 1940s, he became a bishop, and then the ''arajnord'' (leader) of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Romania.

His rise through the hierarchy of the Church culminated in 1955 when, on September 30th 1955, he was elected Catholicos of All Armenians, becoming one of the youngest Catholicoi in the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He reigned until his death in 1994. During his long time as Catholicos, he managed to assert some independence for his church in face of the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] Soviet rule in the Armenian SSR, and lived to see [[religious freedom]] restored under Armenia's national government in 1991.

From then on, he was busy renewing ancient Armenian churches and reviving institutions of the church. He saved a number of church treasures by establishing the [[Alex Manoogian]] Museum of the Mother Church. Vazgen intensified contacts with the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], with the aim of reuniting both wings of Armenian Christianity.
He died on August 18, 1994, after suffering from a long-illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/obituaries/vazgen-i-head-of-armenian-church-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=1|title=Vazgen I, Head of Armenian Church, Dies at 85|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=Wolfgang Saxon|date=1994-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Works of mercy''' (sometimes known as '''acts of mercy''') are practices which [[Christians]] perform.

The practice is popular in the [[Catholic Church]] as an act of both [[penance]] and [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. In addition, the [[Methodism|Methodist church]] teaches that the works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] which lead to holiness&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stephen Bowden|title=Encyclopedia of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGAUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FT0TTrqAO4jl0QHH_dS-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|quote=Works of mercy are, therefore, not merely good deeds but also channels through which Christians receive God's grace.|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aid in [[sanctification]].&lt;ref name="Sanctification"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wesley]]|title=The Works of the Reverend John Wesley, A.M., Volume VI|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4BPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+sanctification&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Xj8TTt6pHMnd0QHt84C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=works%20of%20mercy%20sanctification&amp;f=false|publisher=J.

The works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=R Mauriello|first1=Matthew|title=Mercies Remembered|date=2011|isbn=9781612150055|pages=149-160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "Corporal works of mercy" which concern the material needs of others.
# "Spiritual works of mercy" which concern the spiritual needs of others.

[[Pope John Paul II]] issued a papal encyclical "''[[Dives in misericordia]]''" on 30 November 1980 declaring that "Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others."&lt;ref name=Misericordia &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II, ''Dives in misericordia'', §14, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, November 30, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the [[Divine Mercy]], which derives from apparitions of [[Jesus Christ]] to [[Saint Faustina Kowalska]].

==In the Catholic Church==
Based on Jesus' doctrine of [[the sheep and the goats]], the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] as good deeds&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2447|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their omission is a reason for damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:31-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|1287|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believes Jesus obeyed every [[mitzvah]] and fulfilled the Scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Philippians|2:8}}; {{Bibleverse|Matthew|5:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics perform the works of mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|520|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.&lt;ref name=Cathencycle &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy'']&lt;/ref&gt; In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, [[Pope Francis]] suggested "care for creation" as a new work of mercy, describing it as a "complement" to the existing works. Francis characterized this new work as having both corporal and spiritual components. Corporally, it involves "daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness". Spiritually, it involves contemplating each part of creation to find what God is teaching us through them.&lt;ref name="Francis 2016"&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-message-on-world-day-of-prayer-for-cr Pope Francis: Message on 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation] As a spiritual work of mercy, care for our common home calls for a “grateful contemplation of God’s world” (Laudato si', 214) which “allows us to discover in each thing a teaching which God wishes to hand on to us” (ibid., 85). As a corporal work of mercy, care for our common home requires “simple daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness” and “makes itself felt in every action that seeks to build a better world”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewane Cantu 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dewane |first1=Frank J. |authorlink1=Frank J.

===Corporal Works of Mercy===
[[File:Barmherzigkeitsfenster, Freiburger Münster.jpg|thumb|The six Corporal Works of Mercy, [[Freiburg Minster]], ca. 1230]]
[[File:Pierre Montallier 001.jpg|thumb|''Works of Mercy'' by [[Pierre Montallier]], 1680]]
[[File:1605 Francken sieben Werke der Barmherzigkeit anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Frans Francken the Younger|Frans II Francken]], The Seven Works of Mercy, 1605 ([[Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum Berlin]])]]

Corporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mitzvah of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hospitality.html Jewish Library: Hospitality in Judaism] In Judaism, showing hospitality (hakhnasat orchim) to guests is considered a mitzvah. When one knows of strangers who are hungry or need a place to relax, it becomes a legal obligation. Some rabbis consider hakhnasat orchim (literally the “bringing in of strangers”) to be a part of gemilut hasadim (giving of loving kindness).&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh work of mercy comes from the [[Book of Tobit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/tobit/1 Tobit 1:16-22] 16In the days of Shalmaneser I had performed many charitable deeds for my kindred, members of my people. 17h I would give my bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked. If I saw one of my people who had died and been thrown behind the wall of Nineveh, I used to bury him.* 18Sennacherib returned from Judea, having fled during the days of the judgment enacted against him by the King of Heaven because of the blasphemies he had uttered; whomever he killed I buried. For in his rage he killed many Israelites, but I used to take their bodies away by stealth and bury them. So when Sennacherib looked for them, he could not find them. 19But a certain Ninevite went and informed the king about me, that I was burying them, and I went into hiding. When I realized that the king knew about me and that I was being hunted to be put to death, I became afraid and took flight. 20All my property was confiscated; I was left with nothing. All that I had was taken to the king’s palace, except for my wife Anna and my son Tobiah.* 21But forty days did not pass before two of the king’s sons assassinated him and fled to the mountains of Ararat. A son of his, Esarhaddon,* succeeded him as king. He put Ahiqar, my kinsman Anael’s son, in charge of all the credit accounts of his kingdom, and he took control over the entire administration.i 22Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I returned to Nineveh. Ahiqar had been chief cupbearer, keeper of the signet ring, treasury accountant, and credit accountant under Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians; and Esarhaddon appointed him as Second to himself. He was, in fact, my nephew, of my father’s house, and of my own family.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mitzvah of burial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm Chabad: The taharah, funeral and burial] Jewish law is unequivocal in its insistence that the body, in its entirety, be returned to the earth, in a way that allows for the natural process of its decomposition and re-integration with its primordial source--the soil of which it was formed. It also insists that in the interim between death and interment, the integrity and dignity of the body be respected and preserved.&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/new-work-of-mercy-enshrined-in-first-papal-message News.Va: New work of mercy] Since biblical times, Christians have been called to carry out 6 acts of mercy, listed in St Matthew’s Gospel – giving food and drink to the hungry and thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and the prisoners – with a 7th one, burying the dead, added in medieval times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
# To feed the hungry.
# To give water to the thirsty.
# To clothe the naked.
# To shelter the homeless. 
# To visit the sick.
# To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To bury the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"&gt;[http://scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2447.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church par. 2447] The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Works of Mercy===
Just as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/nasb/ezekiel/33.htm Ezekiel 33:7-9] 7Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me. 8“When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. 9“But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life.&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06619.html Jewish Virtual Library: Forgiveness] The rabbis go even further in the ethical demands made upon the injured party, for not only must he be ready to forgive his injurer, he should also pray that God forgive the sinner before he has come to beg forgiveness (Yad, loc. cit.; Tosef., BK 9:29; Sefer Ḥasidim ed. by R. Margalioth 1957, 267 no. 360). This demand is based on the example of Abraham, who prayed to God to forgive Abimelech (Gen. 20:17). The reasons the injured party should be ready to forgive the injurer are mixed. On the one hand is the self-regarding consideration, already mentioned, that forgiveness to one's fellow wins forgiveness from Heaven. As Philo states: "If you ask pardon for your sins, do you also forgive those who have trespassed against you? For remission is granted for remission" (ed. by Mangey, 2 (1742), 670; see also Yoma 23a). On the other hand there is the purer motive of imitatio dei. Just as it is in the nature of God to be merciful to His creatures, so man in attempting to imitate the ways of God should be forgiving toward those who have injured him (Shab. 133b; see Lev. 19:2). R. Naḥman combines both motives when he says: "Imitate God by being compassionate and forgiving. He will in turn have compassion on you, and pardon your offenses" (op. cit. 81–91).&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm Deuteronomy 15:11] For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.’&lt;/ref&gt; and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/2mc/12 2 Maccabees 12:42] Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
#To instruct the ignorant.
#To counsel the doubtful.
#To admonish the sinners.
#To bear patiently those who wrong us.
#To forgive offenses.
#To comfort the afflicted.
#To pray for the living and the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"/&gt;

=== Representation in art ===
The Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the [[Middle Ages]], the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.
[[File:Caravaggio - Sette opere di Misericordia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]] by [[Caravaggio]], 1606/07 (Naples)]]
The [[Master of Alkmaar]] painted the polyptych of the ''Seven works of mercy'' (ca. 1504) for the [[Grote of Sint-Laurenskerk (Alkmaar)|Church of Saint Lawrence]] in [[Alkmaar, Netherlands]]. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.

The painting of the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger|Frans II Francken]] (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.

A major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of [[Caravaggio]] (1606/07) in [[Naples]], which was commissioned by the Confraternità del [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]] for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting’s [[chiaroscuro]], the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains the bright light as a metaphor for [[mercy]], which "helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples.

==In Methodism==
In [[Methodist]] teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace.&lt;ref name="Wesley2"&gt;
{{cite web|title=Mission: The Works of Mercy |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Wesley/mission.stm |publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]] |quote=John Wesley believed that "means of grace," include both "works of piety" (instituted means of grace) and "works of mercy" (prudential means of grace).

'''Yoga for children''' is a form of [[yoga]] that is designed specifically for [[children]]. It includes [[Asana|poses]] to increase [[Physical strength|strength]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[Motor coordination|coordination]]. Classes are intended to be fun and may include [[Age appropriateness|age-appropriate]] games, animal sounds and creative names for poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wenig|first=Marsha|title=Yoga For Kids|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/210|work=Yoga For Kids Founder|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga for children is also used in classrooms and educational settings. There are many benefits of a regular yoga practice for students, but there are also benefits for the classroom teachers as well. Karen Fabian of MindBodyGreen.com pointed out that "In a school setting, yoga can also benefit teachers by: Giving them an alternate way to handle challenges in the classroom, Giving them a healthy activity to integrate with lesson plans, Give them a way to blend exercise into their classes".

== Age groups ==

The program is designed for children of all ages. Yoga for small children incorporates fun poses, games and songs. For older children the program becomes more active and new poses and games are introduced and [[Pranayama|breathing techniques]] are taught. This helps the children integrate new skills of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] and [[calmness]] into their lives.

== Health benefits ==
:See also [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine]]
The benefits for children are similar to those for adults. Emotional benefits include greater [[optimism]] and a less reactive nature. Mental benefits including increased focus, concentration and improvements in the quality of [[sleep]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LoRusso|first=Amanda|title=Yoga and the Science of Sleep|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kripalu/yoga-and-sleep_b_3572950.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|last=Kripalu|first=Yoga|title=Yoga in Schools|url=http://www.kripalu.org/article/1449/|publisher=Kripalu.org|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic performance has been noted to improve along with confidence in physical abilities. Yoga is used for the treatment of children with [[special needs]], and to aid conventional medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogitimes.com/article/yoga-special-needs-kids/ Special yoga for special kids]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camilledesjardins.com/CamilleDesJardins/Yoga_for_Special_Kids.html Yoga for special kids]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that yoga practice can protect boys from increases in negative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kokinakis|first=Leah|title=Yoha and Adolescents: What do we know?|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/91559/?sequence=3|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical benefits include increased flexibility, improved coordination and [[Balance (ability)|balance]], and increased [[Core stability|core]] and body strength. Mental benefits include stronger [[Mind–body problem|mind-body connection,]] increased [[self-esteem]], better focus and concentration, and increased ability to relax and [[Stress management|cope with stressful situations]]. Social/emotional benefits include more [[Self-awareness|awareness of self]] and those around you and increased [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] and [[Conflict resolution|conflict-resolution]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Fabian, K. (2014, October 29). 7 Ways Kids Benefit From Yoga. Retrieved May 29, 2017, from https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-15075/7-ways-kids-benefit-from-yoga.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tilak&gt;Tilak, V. (2015, September 29). The Benefits of Yoga for Kids. Retrieved May 29, 2017, from http://www.parents.com/fun/sports/exercise/the-benefits-of-yoga-for-kids/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques of yoga in the classroom ==
Although yoga has many health benefits, some criticize the use of yoga in the classroom. The main criticism is that yoga has religious associations that concern some parents. Visi Tilak of Parents.com&lt;ref name=Tilak&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shared the following common concerns in 2013: "Although many adults like the benefits of yoga, some parents feel that the practice might have a religious association and, like prayer, shouldn't be allowed in a public space. They argue that yoga is an offshoot of Hinduism and that it disseminates religious and meditation principles with its use of "[[Om]]" and "[[Namaste]]" chanting. Some also believe that the [[Asana|asanas]], or postures, such as the sun salutation, are a form of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious worship".

Since the benefits of using yoga in the classroom are great, many teachers avoid using the traditional [[Sanskrit]] pose names to avoid the religious association.  Instead, they use generic terms that describe what one's body is doing (such as cat, cow, tree, table, and bridge).

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''''Zazen''''' (literally "[[:wikt:坐|seated]] [[:wikt:禅|meditation]]"; {{lang-ja|座禅}}; {{zh|s=坐禅|t=坐禪|p=zuò chán|w=tso&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-ch'an&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|z|uo|4|-|ch|an|2}}) is a meditative discipline that is typically the primary practice of the [[Zen|Zen Buddhist tradition]].&lt;ref name="hcz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|page=86|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zmm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazen Instructions|url=http://zmm.mro.org/teachings/meditation-instructions/|publisher=[[Zen Mountain Monastery]]|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general it can be regarded as a means of [[vipassana|insight]] into [[Shunyata|the nature of existence]]. In the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], zazen is usually associated with the study of [[koan]]s. The [[Sōtō]] School of Japan, on the other hand, only rarely incorporates [[koan]]s into zazen, preferring an approach where the mind has no object at all, known as [[shikantaza]].&lt;ref name="hcz2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=189–190|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

Zazen is considered the heart of Japanese Sōtō [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice.&lt;ref name="hcz1"/&gt; The aim of zazen is just [[sitting]], that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.&lt;ref name="hcz2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|pages=15–16|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

=== Sitting ===
[[File:Các_thiền_sinh_Tông_Tào_Động_tại_Nhật_Bản_đang_thực_hành_Thiền_Mặc_Chiếu.jpg|thumb|Monks using [[zafu]]s for zazen]]
[[File:Hsuan Hua Hong Kong 1.jpeg|thumb|A young master [[Hsuan Hua]] sitting in full [[Lotus position|lotus]]]]
In Zen temples and monasteries, practitioners traditionally sit zazen as a group in a meditation hall, usually referred to as the ''[[zendo]]''. The practitioner sits on a cushion called a ''[[zafu]]'',&lt;ref name="zmm"/&gt; which itself is usually placed on top of a low, flat mat called a ''[[zabuton]]''.&lt;ref name="zmm"/&gt;

Before taking one's seat, and after rising at the end of the period of zazen, a Zen practitioner performs a ''gassho'' bow to their seat, and a second bow to fellow practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=How To Sit Zazen|url=http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/dsla/zazen.html|publisher=Dogen Sangha Los Angeles|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of a period of zazen is traditionally announced by ringing a bell three times (''shijosho''), and the end of a round by ringing the bell either once or twice (''hozensho'').

Long periods of zazen may alternate with periods of [[kinhin]] (walking meditation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Heine (ed.)|first1=Steven|last2=Wright (ed.)|first2=Dale S.|authorlink1=Steven Heine|title=Zen Ritual : Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice: Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|page=223|ISBN=9780198041467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maezumi|first1=Hakuyu Taizan|last2=Glassman|first2=Bernie|authorlink1=Taizan Maezumi|authorlink2=Bernie Glassman|title=On Zen Practice: Body, Breath, Mind|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=48–49|year=2002|isbn= 086171315X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posture ===
The posture of zazen is seated, with folded legs and hands, and an erect but settled spine.&lt;ref name="zmbm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|page=8|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hands are folded together into a simple [[mudra]] over the belly.&lt;ref name="zmbm"/&gt;  In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the ''[[Dantian|hara]]'' (the [[center of gravity]] in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.

The legs are folded in one of the standard sitting styles:&lt;ref name="zmm"/&gt;

* ''Kekkafuza'' (full-[[Lotus position|lotus]])
* ''Hankafuza'' (half-lotus)
* ''Burmese'' (a cross-legged posture in which the ankles are placed together in front of the sitter)
* ''[[Seiza]]'' (a kneeling posture using a bench or [[zafu]])

In addition, it is not uncommon for modern practitioners to practice zazen in a chair,&lt;ref name="zmm"/&gt; often with a wedge or cushion on top of it so that one is sitting on an incline, or by placing a wedge behind the lower back to help maintain the natural curve of the spine. One can sit comfortably, but not too comfortably, so as to avoid falling asleep. While each of these styles is commonly taught today, Master [[Dogen]] recommended only ''Kekkafuza'' and ''Hankafuza''.

=== Types ===
In his book ''Three Pillars of Zen'', [[Philip Kapleau]] says that practitioners in the Rinzai school face in, towards each other with their backs to the wall, and in the Sōtō school, practitioners face the wall or a curtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip | authorlink=Philip Kapleau| title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |page=10(8)| isbn = 0-385-26093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapleau quotes [[Hakuun Yasutani]]'s lectures for beginners. In lecture four, Yasutani describes the five kinds of zazen: ''bompu'', ''gedo'', ''shojo'', ''daijo'', and ''saijojo'' (he adds the latter is the same thing as [[shikantaza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip |authorlink=Philip Kapleau| title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |pages=48–53| isbn = 0-385-26093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruction ===
Very generally speaking, zazen practice is taught in one of three ways.

# Concentration
# [[Koan]] Introspection
# [[Shikantaza]] (just sitting)&lt;ref&gt;Deshimaru, Taisen (1981) The Way of True Zen, American Zen Association, {{ISBN|978-0972804943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Koan  practice is usually associated with the [[Rinzai]] school and Shikantaza with the [[Sōtō]] school.  In reality many Zen communities use both methods depending on the teacher and students.

====Concentration====

The initial stages of training in zazen resemble traditional Buddhist [[samatha]] meditation in actual practice, and emphasize the development of the [[Five Strengths|power]] of concentration, or ''joriki''&lt;ref name="Bielefeldt1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Carl Bielefeldt]]|title=Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw0IdBImyRYC&amp;pg=PA137|date=16 August 1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90978-6|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (定力) ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|samādhibala}}''). The student begins by focusing on the breath at the ''[[Dantian|hara/tanden]]''&lt;ref name="DogenLeighton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Dogen|Eihei Dogen]]|author2=[[Taigen Dan Leighton]]|author3=[[Shōhaku Okumura]]|author4=[[John Daido Loori]]|title=Dogen's Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Koroku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nqqLwjgzQoC&amp;pg=PA349|date=16 March 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-86171-670-8|pages=348–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Anapanasati|mindfulness of breath]] (''ānāpānasmṛti'') exercises such as counting breath (''sūsokukan'' 数息観) or just watching it (''zuisokukan'' 随息観). [[mantra|Mantras]] are also sometimes used in place of counting. Practice is typically to be continued in one of these ways until there is adequate "[[Ekaggata|one-pointedness]]" of mind to constitute an initial experience of ''[[samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]''. At this point, the practitioner moves to one of the other two methods of zazen.

====Koan introspection====
{{main|Koan}}

Having developed awareness, the practitioner can now focus his or her consciousness on a koan as an object of meditation.  Since koans are, ostensibly, not solvable by intellectual reasoning, koan introspection is designed to shortcut the intellectual process leading to direct realization of a reality beyond thought.

====Shikantaza====
{{main|Shikantaza}}

Shikantaza is a form of meditation, in which the practitioner does not use any specific object of meditation;&lt;ref name="hcz2"/&gt; rather, practitioners remain as much as possible in the present moment,  aware of and observing what passes through their minds and around them. [[Dogen]] says, in his ''[[Shobogenzo]]'', "Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Zazen|author=[[Dogen]]|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|publisher=Soto Zen Text Project|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
