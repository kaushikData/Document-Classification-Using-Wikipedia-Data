In [[electromagnetics]], an antenna's '''power gain''' or simply '''gain''' is a key performance number which combines the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]'s [[directivity]] and [[antenna efficiency|electrical efficiency]].  In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into [[radio wave]]s headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power. When no direction is specified, "gain" is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna's [[main lobe]].  A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the [[radiation pattern]].

Antenna gain is usually defined as the ratio of the power produced by the antenna from a [[far-field]] source on the antenna's beam axis to the power produced by a hypothetical lossless ''[[Isotropic radiator#Antenna theory|isotropic antenna]]'', which is equally sensitive to signals from all directions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=286098|journal = IEEE Std 145-1993|date = 1993-07-01|pages = 1–32|doi = 10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664|isbn = 978-0-7381-0555-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually this ratio is expressed in [[decibels]], and these units are referred to as "''decibels-isotropic''" (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]], in which case the units are written as ''dBd''.  Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dBi,  the relation between these units is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gain(dBd)} = \mathrm{Gain(dBi)} - 2.15&lt;/math&gt; For a given frequency, the antenna's [[effective area]] is proportional to the power gain. An antenna's [[Antenna aperture#Effective length|effective length]] is proportional to the ''square root'' of the antenna's gain for a particular frequency and [[radiation resistance]]. Due to [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]], the gain of any reciprocal antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.

[[Directive gain]] or [[directivity]] is a different measure which does ''not'' take an antenna's electrical efficiency into account. This term is sometimes more relevant in the case of a receiving antenna where one is concerned mainly with the ability of an antenna to receive signals from one direction while rejecting interfering signals coming from a different direction.

==Power gain==

'''Power gain''' (or simply '''gain''') is a unitless measure that combines an antenna's [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;antenna&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[directivity]] ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;G = E_{antenna} \cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;
The notions of efficiency and directivity depend on the following.

===Efficiency===

A transmitting antenna accepts '''input power''' &lt;math&gt;P_{in}&lt;/math&gt; at some point along the [[feedline]].  The point is typically taken to be at the antenna (the ''feedpoint''), thereby not counting power lost due to [[joule heating]] in the feedline and reflections back down the feedline.  The '''efficiency''' &lt;math&gt;E_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is the '''[[Antenna gain#Total radiated power|total radiated power]]''' &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt; divided by the input power at the feedpoint
:&lt;math&gt;E_{antenna} = {P_o \over P_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity theorem]] guarantees that the electrical properties of an antenna, such as efficiency, directivity, and gain, are the same when the antenna is used for receiving as when it is transmitting.

===Directivity===

Antennas are invariably directional to a greater or lesser extent, according to how the output power is distributed in any given direction in [[three dimensions]].  We shall specify direction here in [[spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the '''altitude''' or angle above a specified reference plane (such as the ground), while &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the '''azimuth''' as the angle between the projection of the given direction onto the reference plane and a specified reference direction (such as north or east) in that plane with specified sign (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

The distribution of output power as a function of the possible directions &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is given by its [[radiation intensity]] &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (in [[SI units]]: watts per steradian, W⋅sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The output power is obtained from the radiation intensity by integrating the latter over all solid angles &lt;math&gt;d\Omega = \cos\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_o =\int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \, d\Omega = \int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \cos \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''mean radiation intensity''' &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt; is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;\overline U =\frac{P_o}{4\pi}~~&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; since there are 4&amp;pi; steradians in a sphere
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{E_{antenna}\cdot P_{in}}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the first formula for &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt;.

The directive gain or '''directivity''' &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction is the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to its mean radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}.&lt;/math&gt;
An isotropic antenna, meaning one with the same radiation intensity in all directions, therefore has directivity 1 in all directions independently of its efficiency.  More generally the maximum, minimum, and mean directivities of any antenna are always at least 1, at most 1, and exactly 1.  For the [[half-wave dipole]] the respective values are 1.64 (2.15 [[Decibel|dB]]), 0, and 1.

When the directivity &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum directivity in any direction, namely
:&lt;math&gt;D=\max_{\theta, \, \phi}D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

===Gain===

The power gain or simply '''gain''' &lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction takes efficiency into account by being defined as the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to the mean radiation intensity of a perfectly efficient antenna.  Since the latter equals &lt;math&gt;P_{in}/4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, it is therefore given by

:&lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{P_{in}/4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=E_{antenna}\cdot\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the second equation for &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=E_{antenna}\cdot D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the equation for &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

As with directivity, when the gain &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum gain in any direction.   Since the only difference between gain and directivity in any direction is a constant factor of &lt;math&gt;E_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the fundamental formula of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;G=E_{antenna}\cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;

===Summary===

If only a certain portion of the electrical power received from the transmitter is actually radiated by the antenna (i.e. less than 100% efficiency), then the directive gain compares the power radiated in a given direction to that reduced power (instead of the total power received), ignoring the inefficiency. The directivity is therefore the maximum directive gain when taken over all directions, and is always ''at least'' 1.  On the other hand, the power gain takes into account the poorer efficiency by comparing the radiated power in a given direction to the actual power that the antenna receives from the transmitter, which makes it a more useful figure of merit for the antenna's contribution to the ability of a transmitter in sending a radio wave toward a receiver.  In every direction, the power gain of an isotropic antenna is equal to the efficiency, and hence is always ''at most'' 1, though it can and ideally should exceed 1 for a [[directional antenna]].

Note that in the case of an [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]], ''P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be computed as the transmission line's incident power minus reflected power. Or equivalently, in terms of the rms voltage ''V'' at the antenna terminals:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{in} = V^2 \cdot Re \left\lbrace \frac{1}{Z_{in}} \right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|feedpoint impedance]].

==Gain in decibels==
Published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in [[decibels]] (dB), a logarithmic scale.  From the gain factor G, one finds the gain in decibels as:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBi} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(G\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, an antenna with a peak power gain of 5 would be said to have a gain of 7 dBi. "dBi" is used rather than just "dB" to emphasize that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator.

When actual measurements of an antenna's gain are made by a laboratory, the field strength of the test antenna is measured when supplied with, say, 1 watt of transmitter power, at a certain distance. That field strength is compared to the field strength found using a so-called ''reference antenna'' at the same distance receiving the same power in order to determine the gain of the antenna under test. That ratio would be equal to G if the reference antenna were an isotropic radiator(irad).

However a true isotropic radiator cannot be built, so in practice a different antenna is used. This will often be a half-wave dipole, a very well understood and repeatable antenna that can be easily built for any frequency. The directive gain of a half-wave dipole is known to be 1.64 and it can be made nearly 100% efficient. Since the gain has been measured with respect to this reference antenna, the difference in the gain of the test antenna is often compared to that of the dipole. The "gain relative to a dipole" is thus often quoted and is denoted using "dBd" instead of "dBi" to avoid confusion. Therefore, in terms of the true gain (relative to an isotropic radiator) G, this figure for the gain is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{G}{1.64}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the above antenna with a gain G=5 would have a gain with respect to a dipole of 5/1.64 = 3.05, or in decibels one would call this 10&amp;nbsp;log(3.05) = 4.84&amp;nbsp;dBd. In general:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = G_{dBi} - 2.15dB &lt;/math&gt;
Both dBi and dBd are in common use. When an antenna's maximum gain is specified in decibels (for instance, by a manufacturer) one must be certain as to whether this means the gain relative to an isotropic radiator or with respect to a dipole. If it specifies "dBi" or "dBd" then there is no ambiguity, but if only "dB" is specified then the fine print must be consulted. Either figure can be easily converted into the other using the above relationship.

Note that when considering an antenna's directional pattern, "gain with respect to a dipole" does ''not'' imply a comparison of that antenna's gain in each direction to a dipole's gain in that direction. Rather, it is a comparison between the antenna's gain in each direction to the ''peak'' gain of the dipole (1.64). In any direction, therefore, such numbers are 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB smaller than the gain expressed in dBi.

==Partial gain==
'''Partial gain''' is calculated as power gain, but for a particular [[Antenna (radio)#Polarization|polarization]].  It is defined as the part of the [[radiation intensity]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a given polarization, divided by the total radiation intensity of an isotropic antenna.

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\theta} = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_\theta}{P_{\mathrm{in}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\phi} = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_\phi}{P_{\mathrm{in}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; represent the radiation intensity in a given direction contained in their respective E field component.

As a result of this definition, we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orthogonal polarizations.

:&lt;math&gt;G = G_{\theta} + G_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example calculation==
Suppose a lossless antenna has a radiation pattern given by:

:&lt;math&gt;U = B_0\,\sin^3(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Let us find the gain of such an antenna.

'''Solution''':

First we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna:

:&lt;math&gt; U_{\mathrm{max}} = B_0&lt;/math&gt;

The total radiated power can be found by integrating over all directions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{rad}} = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}U(\theta,\phi)\sin(\theta) \, d\theta \,d\phi = 2 \pi B_0 \int_0^{\pi}\sin^4(\theta) \, d\theta = B_0\left(\frac{3\pi^2}{4} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_{\mathrm{max}}}{P_{\mathrm{rad}}}\right) = 4\pi\left[\frac{B_0}{B_0\left(\frac{3\pi^2}{4}\right)}\right] = \frac{16}{3\pi} = 1.698&lt;/math&gt;

Since the antenna is specified as being lossless the radiation efficiency is 1. The maximum gain is then equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;G = E_{antenna} \, D = (1)(1.698) = 1.698&lt;/math&gt; .

:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBi} = 10 \, \log_{10}(1.698) = 2.30 \, \mathrm{dBi}&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed relative to the gain of a half-wave dipole we would find:

:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = 10 \, \log_{10}(1.698/1.64) = 0.15 \, \mathrm{dBd}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Realized Gain ==
According to IEEE Standard 145-1993,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''Realized Gain''' differs from the above definitions of gain in that it is "reduced by the losses due to the mismatch of the antenna input impedance to a specified impedance."  This mismatch induces losses above the dissipative losses described above; therefore, Realized Gain will always be less than Gain.

Gain may be expressed as '''absolute gain''' if further clarification is required to differentiate it from Realized Gain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Total radiated power (TRP)==
'''Total radiated power''' is the sum of all RF power radiated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement.  TRP is expressed in Watts, or equivalent logarithmic expressions, often dBm or dBW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ctia_ota_test_plan_rev_3_4_2.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title = CTIA Test Plan for Wireless Device Over-the-Air Performance Rev. 3.4.2|date = May 2015|accessdate = |website = Certification Test Plans|publisher = CTIA|last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216175131/http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ctia_ota_test_plan_rev_3_4_2.pdf?sfvrsn=2|archivedate = 2016-02-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRP can be measured while in the close proximity of power-absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the Mobile Device Under Test User.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Mobile Broadband Multimedia Networks: Techniques, Models and Tools for 4G by Luís M. Correia&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRP can be used to determine Body Loss (BoL). The Body Loss is considered as the ratio of TRP measured in the presence of losses and TRP measured while in free space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">{{other uses|Bite the bullet (disambiguation)}}

To "'''bite the bullet'''" is to endure a painful or otherwise unpleasant situation that is seen as unavoidable.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/65400.html Bite the bullet]. Phrases.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first recorded by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his 1891 novel ''[[The Light that Failed]]''.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt;

It was suggested by the movie [[Bite the Bullet (film)|''Bite the Bullet'']] that biting the bullet meant using a shell casing to cover an aching tooth, especially one that had been broken, and where a nerve is exposed. In the film, the slug was removed from the bullet, the cap was hit to expend that charge, and the casing was cut down to allow it to sit level with the other teeth.

It is often stated that it is derived historically from the practice of having a patient clench a [[bullet]] in his or her teeth as a way to cope with the extreme pain of a [[surgical procedure]] without anesthetic, though evidence for biting a bullet rather than a leather strap during surgery is sparse.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt; It has been speculated to have evolved from the British empire expression "to [[bite the cartridge]]", which dates to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but the phrase "chew a bullet", with a similar meaning, dates to at least 1796.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt;

==In philosophy==

A more specific meaning of the phrase is to accept unpleasant consequences of one's assumed beliefs.&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book |first=Nigel |last=Warburton |title=Thinking from A to Z |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-22281-8 |pages=28–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNjM75ItNKAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=bite+the+bullet+philosopher&amp;sig=zxV-AuvTVtdhoqLrS-iiCY07o2I#PPA28,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound [[reasoning]] requires its practitioner to always sustain a [[consistent]] set of beliefs. This may involve accepting a disturbing belief that is a consequence of one's currently held beliefs. It may be disturbing because it is counterintuitive or has other disturbing consequences. Given a [[philosophy|philosopher]]'s currently held beliefs that he or she is not prepared to give up, he or she may have to ''bite the bullet'' by accepting a particular claim offered as an extreme case or putative [[counterexample]].

===Examples===
* A strict [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] will be forced to admit that, if it can be shown that punishing an innocent person would increase the total happiness of the whole society, then there are times when it is morally right to punish an innocent person.&lt;ref name=Warburton/&gt; (''See [[telishment]]'') An ethically "easy" example would be when an informed person—such as an army cadet—voluntarily accepts the "punishment" or risk of "harm" for the greater good.
* The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] can be resolved in the mind of a [[Divine command theory|divine command theorist]] by simply accepting that if [[God]] tells us to do something which appears to be immoral, then we are to accept that it really is moral in the bigger picture, and that it only appears to be immoral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/divine-c.htm#SH4a Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Iep.utm.edu (2006-08-21). Retrieved on 2011-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[consequentialist]] believes that what is called ''right'' or ''wrong'' depends on what consequences come about as a result of a proposed action. As a way to test this view, some counterexamples may be considered which are intended to find out if this view holds up in extreme cases. For example, one may object that some actions appear to be ''right in principle'' even when terrible consequences have resulted from them. Also, there may be times when an action appears to be wrong in principle, but has wonderful consequences. A person wanting to stay faithful to the consequentialist view in the face of an extreme case may have to ''bite the bullet'' by taking the position that, even though these counterexamples do exist, the original view still holds up: 
::''Even though both drivers were driving recklessly, only the one who gets in an accident gets a severe penalty. It's okay that some people are treated differently based solely on their luck.''
:Accepting the existence of [[moral luck]] may seem counterintuitive or even unreasonable to some, so this statement of acceptance can be seen as ''biting the bullet''.

{{about|evidence handling in U.S. criminal trials|rules in American football|Tom Brady#The Brady rule}}
{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''''Brady'' disclosure''' consists of [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] or [[witness impeachment|impeaching]] information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;373 U.S. 83 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates [[due process]]. 

Following ''Brady'', the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant's sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area.

==Definition of the ''Brady'' rule==
The ''Brady'' doctrine is a [[pretrial discovery]] rule that was established by the United States Supreme Court in ''Brady v. Maryland'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], and Guyora Binder, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/ {{smallcaps|Criminal Law - Cases and Materials}}] 4 (Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business, 7th ed. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The rule requires that the prosecution must turn over all exculpatory evidence to the [[defendant]] in a [[criminal case]]. Exculpatory [[evidence]] is evidence that might exonerate the defendant.

==Examples==
Examples include the following:
* The prosecutor must disclose an agreement not to prosecute a witness in exchange for the witness's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Giglio v. United States]]'', 405 U.S. 150 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose leniency (or preferential treatment) agreements made with witnesses in exchange for testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Sudikoff'', 36 F.Supp. 2d 1196 (C.D. Cal. 1999); ''State v. Lindsey'', 621 So. 2d 618 (La. Ct. App. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose [[exculpatory evidence]] known only to the police. That is, the prosecutor has a duty to reach out to the police and establish regular procedures by which the police inform the prosecutor's office of anything that tends to prove the innocence of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyles v. Whitley'', 514 U.S. 419 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all exculpatory evidence is required to be disclosed by Brady and its progeny; only evidence that is "material to guilt or punishment" must be disclosed because its disclosure would create a reasonable probability of changing the outcome of the proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor is not obligated to ''personally'' review police files in search of exculpatory information when the defendant asks for it, but to allow the defense reasonable access.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Herring'', 83 F.3d 1120 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court observed in ''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', "Thus the term 'Brady violation' is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence – that is, to any suppression of so-called 'Brady material' – although strictly speaking, there is never a real 'Brady violation' unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict."&lt;ref&gt;Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "The Inquisition by Special Prosecutor in United States v. Senator Ted Stevens: of Brady, Contempt, and the Forensic Trifecta", Vol. 51, No. 1 ''Criminal Law Bulletin'' 69-125 (Thompson Reuters 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose arrest photographs of the defendant when those photos do not match the victim's description.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth v. Tucceri'', 412 Mass. 401 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some state systems have expansively defined Brady material to include many other items, including for example any documents which might reflect negatively on a witness's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Laural L.; Marsh, Jennifer E.; and Yeh, Brian. [http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/BradyMat.pdf/$file/BradyMat.pdf ''Treatment of Brady v. Maryland Material in United States District and State Courts’ Rules, Orders, and Policies: Report to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331200457/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/bradymat.pdf/$file/bradymat.pdf# |date=2010-03-31 }}, [[Federal Judicial Center]], October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as "Brady cops." Because of the Brady ruling, prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys whenever a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Kamb |authorlink= |last2=Nalder |first2=Eric |title=Cops who lie don't always lose jobs |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/349169_lying29.html |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |publisher= |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing use of Brady, both in the federal and state sectors with somewhat [[ephemerality|evanescent and mercurial]] standards, is one of the most important changes affecting police officers' employment.&lt;ref name="Archison"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.lris.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ROP7-The-Brady-Rule.pdf |first1=Will |last1=Atchison |chapter=Chapter 6: The Brady Rule |title=The Rights of Law Enforcement Officers |edition=7th |format=PDF |publisher=Labor Relations Information System, www.LRIS.com |location=Portland, Oregon |date=July 2015 |isbn=978-1880607299 |ID=ISBN 1880607298 |accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures for compliance==
* In order to ensure compliance with ''Brady'', the United States Supreme Court repeatedly urged the "careful prosecutor" to favor disclosure over concealment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kyles v. Whitley]]'', 514 U.S. 419, 440; ''[[United States. v. Agurs]]'', 427 U.S. 97, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformity with ''Brady'' is a continuing obligation of prosecutors.  Some prosecuting attorney offices have adopted and created specialized procedure and bureaus to meet their burden.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |title=Special Directive 02-08 Brady Protocol |date=December 7, 2002 |publisher=[[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213135/http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pitchess v. Superior Court''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15520905555230302925&amp;hl=en Pitchess v. Superior Court]'', 11 Cal.3d 531 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; is the source for a "[[Pitchess motion]]". Such a motion can be made by a criminal defendant to discover complaints made against a police officer, and the investigation of those complaints, such that they are contained in the officer’s personnel records. The motions can be made in a [[California Superior Court]] under California Evidence Code 1043-1046.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code §§ [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047 1043-1046] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212529/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047# |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the broad nature of the discovery that the associated court rule and statute provide, getting actual records is problematic. In California, there is a carefully prescribed procedure governing such request, and making disclosure without an order is a crime.  The statutory scheme was developed, in part, because law enforcement departments had developed a practice of purging their files concerning misconduct claims made against their officers.&lt;ref name="Steering"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brady List and Pitchess Motions |first1=Jerry L. |last1=Steering |url=http://steeringlaw.com/brady-list-pitchess-motion/ |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law and his wife Margaret Pestorius coordinated the Cairns Peace by Peace organisation.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairnspeacebypeace.org/|title=Peace by Peace – We aren't gunna study war no more!|author=|date=|website=www.cairnspeacebypeace.org|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law also disrupted logging activities on the [[World Heritage site]] [[Fraser Island]].

==Early life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Law was born in 1954 in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of Moorooka. Both his parents served in the army during World War II, His father in [[New Guinea]] and his mother in [[Townsville]]. Law attended [[Yeronga State School|Yeronga State High School]], excelling in the sciences. He attended the [[University of Queensland]], studying chemistry briefly before dropping out. He then worked briefly for the Education Department as a clerk. He subsequently drove taxis for 15 years in Cairns. In his thirties Law returned to Griffith University to study history and politics with a special interest in Asia and Pacific history and regional militarism. He was a campus activist and became President of the Student Union.

==Activism==
Law was radicalised during the government of [[Joh Bjelke Petersen]] and was first arrested at a large right to march street demonstration in Brisbane. He was arrested more than 30 times. Law blogged widely. He had ambitions to become a lawyer but felt he came from the wrong class at the wrong time. He revelled in the intellectual stimulation offered by the court room process. He was acknowledged by judges, barristers and adversaries as an honourable challenger. [[Ciaron O'Reilly|Ciaron O’Reilly]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the thousands arrested and bashed during that period, some of us remained "beat up but upbeat" turning towards, exploring and sustaining nonviolent resistance against war and war preparations. As some turned towards the U.S. traditions of the Catholic Worker and Berrigans, Law turned to a deep exploration of Gandhi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his later years the [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker tradition]] also influenced Law’s approach to nonviolence.

Between 1982 and the mid-2000s, Law worked on a range of campaigns and was judged by colleagues{{who|date=May 2016}} as the "foremost nonviolence strategist in Australia."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He applied nonviolence theory and techniques to local, regional and national projects. Campaigns he was involved with included [[Indigenous rights|Aboriginal rights]], which he initially explored in relation to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. He lived on Fraser Island during the blockade to interrupt logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node/858|title=Webdiary - Founded and Inspired by Margo Kingston - Webdiary - Independent, Ethical, Accountable and Transparent|author=|date=|website=webdiary.com.au|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in local issues such as improving bicycle facilities, the  Cairns Yacht Club and most recently the "Save City Place" campaign in Cairns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/10/16/10631_print-version.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a keen interest in opposing militarism and this became his primary passion. As an antimilitarist activist he first opposed visits of US and UK warships to Australia during the Bicentennial. It was during this time he started to explore the power of small group nonviolence. He teamed up with fellow nonviolent activist Margaret Pestorius and they followed their shared passion of educating ordinary people about the practice of nonviolence. With the  Cairns Peace by Peace group they began citizens' inspections of visiting US warships at a time when Law considered Australia was in a state of perpetual war.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"/&gt; In 2005 he entered Pine Gap spy base near Alice Springs with three other people from Christians Against All Terrorism. This action was a turning point in Law's pursuit of more powerful types of activity and ultimately led to his His work culminated fittingly{{how|date=May 2016}} in the regional Queensland town of Rockhampton at a time when most{{who|date=May 2016}} looked toward Canberra and Washington for political change. decision to conduct a  ploughshare type action in Rockhampton during the 2011 Talisman Sabre Exercises.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

== Personal life ==
During the court case in Alice Springs in 2007 he probably{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} had his first heart attack and his health declined consistently from that point. He struggled with diabetes and heart disease and their consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Law and Margaret Pestorius had a son, Joseph.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

'''Cleanliness''' is both the [[abstraction|abstract]] state of being clean and free from germs and dirt, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through [[cleaning]].
Cleanliness is a good quality, as indicated by the [[aphorism]]: "cleanliness is next to [[godliness]]",&lt;ref&gt;Suellen Hoy, ''Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as '[[health]]' and '[[beauty]]'.

In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from [[wikt:purity|purity]], which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension, or implies a system of interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Shove, ''Comfort, Cleanliness, and Convenience: The Social Organization of Normality'' (Berg, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; "Cleanliness," observed [[Jacob Burckhardt]], "is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Burckhardt, ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'', as quoted by Douglas Blow, ''The Culture of Cleanliness in Renaissance Italy'' (Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.

On a practical level, cleanliness is thus related to [[hygiene]] and [[disease]] prevention. [[Washing]] is one way of achieving physical cleanliness, usually with [[water]] and often some kind of [[soap]] or [[detergent]]. [[Cleaning]] procedures are of the utmost importance in many forms of manufacturing.

As an assertion of Moral superiority or respectability, cleanliness has played a role in establishing cultural values in relation to [[social class]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Brown, ''Foul Bodies: Cleanliness in Early America'' (Yale University Press, 2009), p. 327; [[Iris Marion Young]], "The Scaling of Bodies and the Politics of Identity," as excerpted in ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', edited by Lawrence E. Cahoone (Blackwell, 2003, 2nd ed.), p. 372; Nancy Cook, ''Gender, Identity, and Imperialism: Women Development Workers in Pakistan'' (Macmillan, 2007), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanliness is linked with proper hygiene.  A person who is said to be clean usually depicts cleanliness.

The [[Bible]] has many rituals of purification relating to [[menstruation]], [[childbirth]], [[religion and sexuality|sexual relations]], [[Tzaraath|skin disease]], [[death]], and [[korban|animal sacrifice]]s. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] prescribes several kinds of [[hand washing]] for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwtw.pl/wp-content/uploads/wst/12-2/Pedersen.pdf IS THE CHURCH OF ETHIOPIA A JUDAIC CHURCH ?]&lt;/ref&gt; The women in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eotc.faithweb.com/liturgy.htm The Liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Hinduism===
&lt;!--"Transfer of merit" links here. Please adjust wikilink over there if this section is renamed or deleted. Thank you.--&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], cleanliness is an important virtue and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' describes it as one of the divine qualities which one must practice. The Sanskrit word for cleanliness is 'Śaucam'. The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' repeats this word in five slokas at 13.8, 16.3, 16.7, 17.14 and 18.42. ''[[Śrīmad Bhāgavatam]]'' mentioned 'Śaucam' at 1.16.26, 1.17.24 (as one of the four legs of Satya Yuga or Golden Age), 1.17.42, 3.28.4 (as spiritual practice), 3.31.33 (those who are addicted to sex life will not understand cleanliness), 4.29.84 (purity of Atman), 7.11.8-12 (one of the thirty qualities to be acquired), 7.11.21 (cleanliness as a characteristic of a Brahmin), 7.11.24 (cleanliness is a quality of the best worker), 11.3.24 (one should learn cleanliness to serve his or her Guru), 11.17.16 (cleanliness is a natural quality of a Brahmin), 11.18.36 (cleanliness as a virtue among those who has realised God), 11.18.43 (quality to be practiced by a householder), 11.21.14 (means of cleansing one body and mind), 11.19.36-39 (cleanliness means detachment from desire-prompted actions)  12.2.1 (effects of Kali Yuga on cleanliness).  

''Srimad Bhagavatam'' also recognises cleanliness as one of the thirty qualities which one must acquire to obtain the grace of God&lt;ref&gt;''Srimad Bhagavatam'' 7.11.8-12&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies internal and external cleanliness among the twelve regular duties.&lt;ref&gt;''Srimad Bhagavatam''  11.19.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanliness is also an exalted quality which characterises the Satya Yuga (Golden Age) in Hinduism. As stated by many Hindu scriptures that cleanliness is a way of relative to God.


                  ''deva-dvija-guru-prājña-pūjanaḿ śaucam ārjavam | brahmacaryam ahiḿsā ca śārīraḿ tapa ucyate&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 17.14&lt;/ref&gt;''
                               Service of the Devas (gods), holy men, teachers, parents and wise persons,
                               as also observance of cleanliness, uprightness, continence, and non-injury - 
                               these constitute austerities pertaining to the body.''

                   ''anapekṣhaḥ śhuchir dakṣha udāsīno gata-vyathaḥ| sarvārambha-parityāgī yo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ''&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 12.16&lt;/ref&gt;
                               Those who are indifferent to worldly gain, externally and internally pure, 
                               skillful, without cares, untroubled, and free from selfishness in all undertakings, 
                               such devotees of mine are very dear to me.

Cleanliness or Śaucam is both internal and external. Hinduism extols not only external cleanliness but also internal cleanliness or purity. Since their minds are constantly absorbed in the all-pure Lord, devotees become internally cleansed from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, ego, etc. In this state of mind, they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well. Thus, in accordance with the old saying, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness,” they are also externally pure.[http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/12/verse/16]    

Cleanliness is also a virtue which has to be cultivated by Vedic students and spiritual aspirants.[https://innerschool.org/spb/sb/3/28/4/index.html]

''Srimad Bhagavatam'' also explains the internal and external cleanliness as ''"My dear Uddhava, general cleanliness, washing the hands, bathing, performing religious services at sunrise, noon and sunset, worshiping Me, visiting holy places, chanting japa, avoiding that which is untouchable, uneatable or not to be discussed, and remembering My existence within all living entities as the Paramatman — these principles should be followed by all members of society through regulation of the mind, words and body."''&lt;ref&gt;''Srimad Bhagavatam'' 11.17.34-35  &lt;/ref&gt;  

All Hindus must make a visit to the seven sacred rivers. Bathing in these rivers will purify the mind and increase their good merits. Therefore, to invoke the presence of the holy rivers, the following Mantra is chanted before daily bath: 
''AUM gaṇge ca yamune caiva godāvarī sarasvatī | narmade siṇdhu kāverī jalesmin saṃnidhim kuru''
 
In this water, I invoke the presence of holy waters from the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu and Kaveri.
 
        

All [[Hindus]] must have taken a bath before entering temples in order to seek blessings. They also wash their feet before entering the temple. In some [[orthodox Hinduism|Orthodox Hindu]] households, taking a bath after visiting a [[funeral]] is required as some [[hindus]] believe that it is an inauspicious thing to witness and the in-auspiciousness would follow. This is also related to the pollution of the River Ganges.

Hindus also clean their homes particularly well in preparing to celebrate [[Diwali]] each year as they believe that it brings good [[luck]]. Most [[Hindus]] also believe that keeping your house clean and great [[Hindu devotional movements|devotion]] are [[gestures]] to welcome the [[Goddess]] [[Lakshmi]] to their abode to stay. Some orthodox Hindus refrain from cleaning their houses on a [[Friday]] as it is a day dedicated to [[Goddess]] [[Lakshmi]] and cleaning homes on that day is considered inauspicious, so they are allowed to clean their homes on the rest of the days. [[Tamil people]] also keep their homes clean in preparation for Diwali, Pongal or Bhol.

Hinduism also gives a deeper meaning to cleanliness. In ''Srimad Bhagavatam'' 11.19.36-39, cleanliness is also defined as detachment from activities prompted by desire. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one's skin with water.&lt;ref&gt;https://innerschool.org/spb/sb/11/19/36-39/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islam===
{{main|Muslim hygienical jurisprudence}}
There are many verses in the Quran which discuss cleanliness. For example, “…Truly, Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He 'loves those who keep themselves pure and clean” (2:222). And, “…In mosque there  are men who love to be clean and pure. Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure” (9:108).

First lessons in Islamic manuals of [[catechism]] are matters of cleanliness. Subjects taught first in the book of cleanliness include: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean. [[Muslims]] are required to perform [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] (''[[wudu]]'') before every prayer, and are recommended to stay in the state of ablution at all times. A ritual bath (''[[ghusl]]'') is performed on Fridays before the Friday Prayer (''[[Jumu'ah|Juma]]''). Ritual baths are recommended for spiritual purity, also after committing a sin, and are necessary for those who have washed a funeral. Special attention is given to cleaning homes before the arrival of guests or before feasts ([[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]), and holy days and nights.

==Hygiene==

{{Main|Hygiene}}

Since the [[germ theory of disease]], cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other [[hazardous waste|hazardous materials]]. A reaction to an excessive desire for a germ-free environment began to occur around 1989, when [[David P. Strachan|David Strachan]] put forth the "[[hygiene hypothesis]]" in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]].'' In essence, this hypothesis holds that environmental microbes play a useful role in developing the immune system; the fewer germs people are exposed to in early childhood, the more likely they are to experience health problems in childhood and as adults. The [[valuation (ethics)|valuation]] of cleanliness, therefore, has a social and cultural dimension beyond the requirements of hygiene for practical purposes.

==Industry==
In industry, certain processes such as those related to [[integrated circuit]] manufacturing, require conditions of exceptional cleanliness which are achieved by working in [[cleanroom]]s. Cleanliness is essential to successful [[electroplating]], since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. The industry has developed specialized techniques for [[parts cleaning]], as well as tests for cleanliness. The most commonly used tests rely on the wetting behaviour of a clean hydrophilic metal surface. Cleanliness is also important to [[vacuum]] systems to reduce [[outgassing]]. Cleanliness is also crucial for [[semiconductor]] manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;C. Y. Chang and Francis Kai, ''GaAs High Speed Devices: Physics, Technology, and Circuit Applications'' (John Wiley, 1994), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.]]
[[File:Cornselection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Selective breeding]] transformed [[teosinte]]'s small spikes (left) into modern [[maize]] (right). [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] argued that [[evolution]] worked in a similar way.]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]] by [[natural selection]], at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]].

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, arguing from circumstantial evidence that selection by human breeders could produce change, and that since there was clearly a struggle for existence, that natural selection must be taking place. But he lacked an explanation either for [[genetic variation]] or for [[heredity]], both essential to the theory. Many [[alternatives to natural selection|alternative theories]] were accordingly considered by biologists, threatening to undermine Darwinian evolution.

Some of the first evidence was provided by Darwin's contemporaries, the naturalists [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]]. They described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain. 
Darwinists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], and in the 20th century [[Hugh Cott]] and [[Bernard Kettlewell]], sought evidence that natural selection was taking place. Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment. Poulton's 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', written [[Eclipse of Darwinism|during Darwinism's lowest ebb]], used all the forms of coloration to argue the case for natural selection. Cott described many kinds of camouflage, and in particular his drawings of coincident [[disruptive coloration]] in frogs convinced other biologists that these deceptive markings were products of natural selection. Kettlewell experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]], showing that the species had [[industrial melanism|adapted as pollution changed the environment]]; this provided compelling evidence of Darwinian evolution.

===Snow camouflage===
{{main|Snow camouflage}}

In his 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] considered the white coloration of [[Arctic]] animals. He recorded that the [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[stoat|ermine]] and [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] change their colour seasonally, and gave "the obvious explanation", that it was for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the case of prey animals like the Arctic hare, this is concealment from predators, reducing the chance of being seen and eaten, directly affecting survival. In the case of predators like the Arctic fox, camouflage provides concealment from prey, increasing the change of a successful hunt, and again improving survival chances. Thus whether the camouflage is defensive or aggressive, it would be favoured by natural selection. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] named the two cases "general protective resemblance" and "general aggressive resemblance" respectively.&lt;ref name=Poulton/&gt;}} The modern ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that [[crypsis|cryptic]] brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." All the same, he notes, "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by [[Gyrfalcon]]s throughout the winter."&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W.

More recently, decreasing snow cover in Poland, caused by [[global warming]], is reflected in a reduced percentage of [[Mustela nivalis|white-coated weasels]] that become white in winter. Days with snow cover halved between 1997 and 2007, and as few as 20 percent of the weasels had white winter coats. This was shown to be a result of natural selection by predators making use of camouflage mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=White-furred animals could die out because of climate change, study suggests |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/05/24/white-animals-could-die-climate-change-study-suggests/ |accessdate=24 May 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atmeh Andruszkiewicz Zub 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Atmeh | first=Kamal | last2=Andruszkiewicz | first2=Anna | last3=Zub | first3=Karol | title=Climate change is affecting mortality of weasels due to camouflage mismatch | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=7648 | date=24 May 2018 | doi=10.1038/s41598-018-26057-5| pmid=29795400 | pmc=5967304 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7648A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Coincident disruptive coloration}}

In the words of camouflage researchers [[Innes Cuthill]] and A. Székely, the English zoologist and [[List of camoufleurs|camouflage expert]] [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' provided "persuasive arguments for the survival value of coloration, and for [[adaptation]] in general, at [[Eclipse of Darwinism|a time when natural selection was far from universally accepted]] within evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Innes Cuthill|Cuthill, I.

The attitude and very striking colour-scheme thus combine to produce an extraordinary effect, whose deceptive appearance depends upon the breaking up of the entire form into two strongly contrasted areas of brown and white. Considered separately, neither part resembles part of a frog. Together in nature the white configuration alone is conspicuous. This stands out and distracts the observer's attention from the true form and contour of the body and appendages on which it is superimposed".&lt;ref name=Cott1940&gt;{{cite book | author=Cott, Hugh B. | authorlink=Hugh B.

===Industrial melanism===
{{main|Industrial melanism|Peppered moth evolution}}

Between 1953 and 1956, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]]. He presented results showing that in a polluted urban wood with dark tree trunks, dark moths survived better than pale ones, causing [[industrial melanism]], whereas in a clean rural wood with paler trunks, pale moths survived better than dark ones. The implication was that survival was caused by camouflage against suitable backgrounds, where predators hunting by sight (insect-eating birds, such as the [[great tit]]s used in the experiment) selectively caught and killed the less well-camouflaged moths. The results were intensely controversial, and from 2001 [[Michael Majerus]] carefully repeated the experiment. The results were published posthumously in 2012, vindicating Kettlewell's work as "the most direct evidence", and "one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cook, L.

===Batesian===
{{main|Batesian mimicry}}

[[Batesian mimicry]], named for the 19th century naturalist [[Henry Walter Bates]] who first noted the effect in 1861, "provides numerous excellent examples of natural selection"&lt;ref name=Rice2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Stanley A. |title=Encyclopedia of Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA274 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4381-1005-9 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; at work. The evolutionary entomologist [[James Mallet]] noted that [[mimicry]] was "arguably the oldest [[Darwinian]] theory not attributable to Darwin."&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Inspired by ''On the Origin of Species'', Bates realized that unrelated Amazonian butterflies resembled each other when they lived in the same areas, but had different coloration in different locations in the Amazon, something that could only have been caused by adaptation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallet |title=Mimicry: An interface between psychology and evolution |journal=PNAS |date=July 2001 |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=8928–8930 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171326298 |pmid=11481461 |pmc=55348|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.8928M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Müllerian===
{{main|Müllerian mimicry}}

[[Müllerian mimicry]], too, in which two or more distasteful species that share one or more predators have come to mimic each other's warning signals, was clearly adaptive; [[Fritz Müller]] described the effect in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of [[mathematical biology|a mathematical argument]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be.{{efn|If one may ignore, as [[James Mallet|Mallet]] comments, [[Malthus]]'s discussion of the effects of [[population growth]] that influenced Darwin.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Yellow-banded.poison.dart.frog.arp.jpg|upright|thumb|[[aposematic|Warning coloration]] protects poison dart frog ''[[Dendrobates leucomelas]]''.]]

==Aposematism==
{{main|Aposematism}}

In 1867, in a letter to Darwin, Wallace [[Aposematism#Wallace, 1867|described warning coloration]]. The evolutionary zoologist [[James Mallet]] notes that this discovery "rather illogically"&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; followed rather than preceded the accounts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, which both rely on the existence and effectiveness of warning coloration.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{efn|[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] invented the name [[aposematism]] some years later, in 1890, in his book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |date=1890 |title=The Colours of Animals |page=Foldout after page 339|title-link=The Colours of Animals }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The conspicuous colours and patterns of animals with strong defences such as toxins are [[advertising in biology|advertised]] to [[predator]]s, [[honest signalling|signalling honestly]] that the animal is not worth attacking. This directly increases the [[reproductive fitness]] of the potential prey, providing a strong selective advantage. The existence of unequivocal warning coloration is therefore clear evidence of natural selection at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherratt, T. N. |authorlink=Thomas N.

[[File:Brazilian Skunk from Edward Bagnall Poulton Colours of Animals 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Warning coloration of the "Brazilian Skunk" in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', 1890]]

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', renamed Wallace's concept of warning colours "aposematic" coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim |authorlink=James Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulton's explanations of coloration are emphatically Darwinian. For example, on aposematic colouration he wrote that

{{blockquote|At first sight the existence of this group seems to be a difficulty in the way of the general applicability of the theory of natural selection. Warning Colours appear to benefit the would-be enemies rather than the conspicuous forms themselves, and the origin and growth of a character intended solely for the advantage of some other species cannot be explained by the theory of natural selection. But the conspicuous animal is greatly benefited by its Warning Colours. If it resembled its surroundings like the members of the other class, it would be liable to a great deal of accidental or experimental tasting, and there would be nothing about it to impress the memory of an enemy, and thus to prevent the continual destruction of individuals. The object of Warning Colours is to assist the education of enemies, enabling them to easily learn and remember the animals which are to be avoided. The great advantage conferred upon the conspicuous species is obvious when it is remembered that such an easy and successful education means an education involving only a small sacrifice of life."&lt;ref name=Poulton1890/&gt;&lt;!--end blockquote--&gt;}}

Poulton summed up his allegiance to Darwinism as an explanation of Batesian mimicry in one sentence: "Every step in the gradually increasing change of the mimicking in the direction of specially protected form, would have been an advantage in the struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=Poulton1890&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |date=1890 |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-bagnall-poulton/the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala/1-the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala.shtml |title=The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner |pages=160–161, 220, and whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Peter J. Bowler commented that Poulton used his book to complain about experimentalists' lack of attention to what field naturalists (like Wallace, Bates, and Poulton) could readily see were adaptive features. Bowler added that "The fact that the adaptive significance of coloration ''was'' (sic) widely challenged indicates just how far anti-Darwinian feeling had developed.{{efn|In the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].}} Only field naturalists such as Poulton refused to give in, convinced that their observations showed the validity of selection, whatever the theoretical problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

The '''conservation and restoration of new media art''' is the study and practice of techniques for sustaining [[new media art]] created using from materials such as digital, biological, performative, and other variable media.

Artists' increased use of [[multi-media]], [[Digital data|digital]], and [[internet]] media since the 1960s has called into question the conventional strategies by which society preserves, cares for, and redisplays cultural artifacts created with or on [[ephemera]] media formats. While the most obvious vulnerability of [[new media art]] is rapid technological [[obsolescence]], the study of its other aspects that defy traditional conservation—including hybrid, contextual, or 'live' qualities—has provoked investigation into new strategies for preserving [[conceptual art]], [[performance art|performance]], [[installation art]], [[video art]], and even to a limited extent [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

==Relationship to other preservation efforts==

The catchall term sometimes applied to such genres, ''variable media'', suggests that it is possible to recapture the experience of these works independently of the specific physical material and equipment used to display them in a given exhibition or performance. As the nature of multi-media artworks calls for the development of new standards, techniques, and [[metadata]] within preservation strategies, the idea that certain artworks incorporating an array of media elements could be variable opens up the possibility for experimental standards of preservation and reinterpretation.

Nevertheless, many new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and [[metadata]] standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the [[Open Archival Information System]] model.

While some of this research parallels and exploits progress made in the practice of [[Digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]], the preservation of new media art offers special challenges and opportunities. Whereas scientific data and legal records may be easily [[#Migration|migrated]] from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions.

== Preservation strategies ==

===Storage===
The acquisition and storage of the physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term tactic at best, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or can 'stale' in storage.&lt;ref name="Depocas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach|year=2003|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|location=New York|isbn=0968469329|page=129|author1=Depocas, Alain |author2=Jon Ippolito |author3=Caitlin Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as [[Internet art]], [[performance art]] and [[live electronic music]].

Variations on storage include:

* '''Refreshing'''
The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format.

* '''Restoration'''
The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original.

* '''Networked storage'''
The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives.

===Migration===
To migrate a work of art is to upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original.&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|126}} This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel.

===Emulation===
The process of simulating an older operating system (or by extension, other supporting infrastructure) on a newer software or hardware platform is called [[emulator|emulation]].&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|125}} As in migration, the impetus behind emulation is to keep a work alive though its original media may become obsolete; unlike migration, however, emulation of computer-based art preserves the original code underlying the artwork. Emulation software is currently in various stages of development and efficiency.

==== ''Seeing Double'': an emulation testbed ====
In 2004, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], in conjunction with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]], held an exhibition entitled ''Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variablemedia.net/e/seeingdouble/ ''Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt; as a trial of emulation. In the exhibition, artworks operating on their original physical media were displayed alongside versions emulated on newer physical media. The exhibition was organized with the participation of computer researcher and emulation specialist, [[Jeff Rothenberg]]. In 1998, Rothenberg had published "Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.clir.org/PUBS/reports/rothenberg/contents.html|title=Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation|date=January 1998|author=Jeff Rothenberg}} ([http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/rothenberg/pub77.pdf 1999 full text])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinterpretation===
The most powerful, but also most risky, preservation strategy for new media art is to reinterpret the work each time it is re-created. Reinterpretation may require rewriting code for a completely different platform, following site-specific instructions regarding installation, or recasting a work in a contemporary medium with the metaphoric value of an outdated medium. Reinterpretation is a dangerous technique when not warranted by the artist, but it may be the only way to re-create performed, installed, or networked art designed to vary with context.&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

==Preservation tools==

===Variable Media Questionnaire===
First developed in 2000 by [[Jon Ippolito]], associate curator at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the Variable Media Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html The Variable Media Network]&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive form linked to a larger database, which is designed to capture behavioral information about digital, performative, and other variable media artworks upon their acquisition by a museum. The goal is to specifically define 'what it is' and 'what is needed' when the museum is acquiring a work of this kind. The goal of the Questionnaire is to assist artists and museum professionals in understanding which attributes of an artwork may change and how best to make those changes when future re-creations necessitate them.

Based on the premise that some aspects of an artwork's logic or presentation can be considered independently from the physical context and equipment used to display that artwork, the Questionnaire captures information about the following ''behaviors'' or medium-independent aspects:

* '''Contained'''
Covers glazing; coating; support/structure/mounting; frame; acceptable change in surface.

* '''Installed'''
Covers space; boundary; access; lighting; sound; security; base/s; distribution of elements; display equipment for inert elements; architectural placement; equipment visibility.

* '''Performed'''
Covers props; set; costumes; performers; number of performers; format of instructions; instructions apply to...; documentation of new performances; audience location; boundary; synchronization of performance.

* '''Interactive'''
Covers user input; interaction mechanism; maintenance.

* '''Reproduced'''
Covers relationship to artist master; location of master; status of master; acceptable fabricators and vendors; acceptable submasters or exhibition copy; permission to create submaster; fate of exhibition copy; permission to compress/digitize.

* '''Duplicable'''
Covers [[Chemically inert|inert]] material; physical attributes of inert material; authorized fabricators and vendors; materials duplicated according to...; electronic equipment and hardware; fate of exhibition copies.

* '''Encoded'''
Covers screen resolution; color palette; external data source; fonts; source openness.

* '''Networked'''
Covers exhibition context; external [[database|data sources]]; non-standard protocol; minimum [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]; network model.

==Metadata standards==

===Media Art Notation System (MANS)===

Developed by [[Richard Rinehart]], Digital Media Director and Adjunct Curator, [[Berkeley Art Museum]]/Pacific Film Archive, MANS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Rinehart|url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about/formalnotation.pdf|title=A System of Formal Notation for Scoring Works of Digital and Variable Media Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135334/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about/formalnotation.pdf|archivedate=June 9, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is described as a 'formal [[notation system]] for [[media art]]' that is in keeping with existing preservation frameworks and vocabularies currently being used to document and preserve other forms of art by museums.

Using the metaphor of the [[sheet music|musical score]], as a form of declarative and conceptual notation of music, Rinehart likens Media Art to musical compositions that are able to maintain their original integrity while being realized by different instruments or in different arrangements, over evolving time periods; in this sense, scores are considered to be inherently variable. In Rinehart's view, [[media art]] (in which logical information is considered separate from physical hardware) is able to be 'scored' based on the information acquired from a document like the Variable Media Questionnaire to be realized by different media-equipment.

Maintaining the notion of the musical score, the Media Art Notation System is derived as (and has as its underlying structure) an interpretation of computer programming languages, drawing primarily from [[Declarative programming|Digital Item Declaration Language]] (DIDL), a type of [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) that allows for greater, more granular descriptions of a multi-component [[Digital object identifier|digital object]]. MANS has three layers; the conceptual model of documentation, the preferred expression format (vocabulary) for the model (the interpretation of DIDL XML) and, its top layer, the score, which serves as a record of the work that is database-processable.

It is hoped that by interweaving the ideas of a declarative language and a more procedural language, MANS is able to act as a backbone to the artwork by being specifically suggestive though not overly prescriptive of how to best delineate and then, later, reinterpret an artwork.

== History of new media art preservation ==

===Individual efforts===
Numerous contemporary art conservators have contributed individual efforts toward new media art preservation:

*Carol Stringari of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York
As a deputy director and chief conservator, Stringari led laser research of a monochromatic painting by [[Ad Reinhardt]] and project on conservation of the works of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. She later won the CAA/Heritage Preservation Award for Distinction for Scholarship and Conservation for her work on Ad Reinhardt's technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=28750&amp;int_modo=1| title= Guggenheim's Carol Stringari Wins CAA/Heritage Preservation Award| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*Pip Laurenson of the [[Tate Gallery]] in London
Head of Time-based media conservation at the Tate, Laurenson is currently working to achieve her PhD in the care and management of time-based media works of art at University College London.

*Jill Sterret of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].
Director of Collections &amp; Conservation at SFMOMA, Sterret is an avid collector and preserver of artworks made by contemporary artists. She is committed to the vital collaborations between artists, curators, technical experts, registrars, and conservators that support contemporary art conservation practice.

===Consortium efforts===
The variable media concept was developed in 1998, first as a creative strategy Ippolito brought to the adversarial collaborations produced with artists Janet Cohen and Keith Frank, and later as a preservation strategy called the Variable Media Initiative that he applied to endangered artworks in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]'s collection. In 2002 the Guggenheim  partnered with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]] for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal to form the Variable Media Network, a concerted effort to develop a museum-standard, best practice for the collection and preservation of [[new media art]]. Apart from Stringari and Ippolito, other key members of the Variable Media Network included [[Alain Depocas]], Director of the Centre for Research and Documentation, Daniel Langlois Foundation; and Caitlin Jones, former Daniel Langlois Variable Media Preservation Fellow at the Guggenheim Museum.

Around this time similar investigations into the preservation of digital/media art were being led on the West Coast by Richard Rinehart, who published an article on the subject, "The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back? Collecting and Preserving Digital/Media Art for the Next Century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switch.sjsu.edu/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php?artc=233|title=The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back?

Rinehart had also established Conceptual &amp; Intermedia Arts Online (CIAO)&lt;ref name=Avantegarde&gt; [http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html Archiving the Avant-Garde]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419010721/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html |date=April 19, 2007 }} &lt;/ref&gt;with Franklin Furnace, the New York-based performance art-grants giving organization and archive/advocate of performance, 'ephemeral' or non-traditional art under the directorship of [[Martha Wilson]].

Members of the Variable Media Network and CIAO subsequently joined forces with other organizations, including [[Rhizome.org]], an affiliate of New York's [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], for collective preservation endeavors such as Archiving the Avant Garde.&lt;ref name=Avantegarde/&gt; This broader coalition, operating under the rubric Forging the Future,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forging-the-future.com バイク買取＠東京ならここで査定！]&lt;/ref&gt; is managed by the [[Still Water]] lab at the University of Maine and offers free, open-source tools for new media preservation, including the 3rd-generation Variable Media Questionnaire.

In 2002, Timothy Murray founded the [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]. Named after the pioneering critic of the commercialization of mass media, the late Professor Rose Goldsen of Cornell University. The Archive hosts international art work produced on CD-Rom, DVD-Rom, video, digital interfaces, and the internet. Its collection of supporting materials includes unpublished manuscripts and designs, catalogues, monographs, and resource guides to new media art. The curatorial vision emphasizes digital interfaces and artistic experimentation by international, independent artists. Designed as an experimental center of research and creativity, the Goldsen Archive includes materials by individual artists and collaborates on conceptual experimentation and archival strategies with international curatorial and fellowship projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/7761936a|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important initiatives include [[DOCAM]], an international research alliance on the documentation and the conservation of the media arts heritage organized by the Daniel Langlois Foundation, and the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA), organized by the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9684">The '''Czech Helsinki Committee''' is a [[NGO|non-governmental]] [[non-profit organization]] for human rights. It has operated in Czechoslovakia since 1988 and in the Czech Republic since 1993. It  was founded as one of the first "Helsinki" organizations outside of the USSR, and is the first formalized [[human rights]] [[NGO]] in the country.

==History of the Czech Helsinki Committee==

===[[OSCE|CSCE]]===

[[Henry Kissinger]] is often credited with having coined the term [[détente]] in 1973 during the height of [[Cold War]] tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yamani|first1=Mai|title=These moderates are in fact fanatics, torturers and killers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/06/israel.usa|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the so-called détente phase, on 3 July 1973, that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe ([[OSCE#History|CSCE]]) was opened in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/39501|website=OSCE|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OSCE#History|CSCE]] was created as a multilateral forum for dialogue and negotiation motivated by the political will to improve relations between East and West and contribute to peace, security, justice and cooperation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/39501|website=OSCE|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSCE#History|CSCE]] continued again in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] from 18 September 1973 to 21 July 1975, and concluded in [[Helsinki]] on 1 August 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/39501|website=OSCE|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting in August set up the [[Helsinki Final Act]] that contained key commitments on polito-military, economic, environmental, and human rights issues—later known as the “Helsinki process” or “[[Helsinki Accords]]”. The [[Helsinki Accords]] also established ten principles, the “[[Helsinki Accords#Articles|Decalogue]]”, guiding relations between States and governing the relationship between States and their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.osce.org/who/history|website=OSCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Although the CSCE continued primarily as a series of meetings and conferences, the Paris Summit in November 1990—after the end of the [[Cold War]]—refocused the [[OSCE#History|CSCE]] on managing the new changes in Europe. The [[OSCE#History|CSCE]] gained permanent institutions and operational capabilities, and the name was changed to the [[OSCE|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]] as part of a decision by the Budapest Summit of Heads of State or Government in December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.osce.org/who/history|website=OSCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Helsinki Accords===

The thirty-five [[Helsinki Accords#Heads of states, heads of governments and leaders of ruling parties|participating States]] of the [[OSCE#History|CSCE]] signed the Helsinki Final Act, which at that time, was the only international agreement linking peace and security with an obligation for the respect of human rights. The [[Helsinki Accords#Articles|Decalogue]], specifically Principle VII, addressed “{{not a typo|[r]espect}} for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe Final Act|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/39501|website=OSCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 1976, at a press conference initiated by physicist and human rights activist [[Andrei Sakharov|Dr. Andrei Sakharov]], [[Yuri Orlov|Dr. Yuri F. Orlov]]—also a well respected physicist and member of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]] Academy of Science—announced the formation of the Moscow Group for Assistance in Implementation of Helsinki Agreements, later known as the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Language Page|url=http://www.mhg.ru/english/18E49C2|website=Moscow Helsinki Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watchdog organization based on Principle VII of the [[Helsinki Accords#Articles|Decalogue]], began documenting cases of humanitarian violations against [[USSR]] citizens and distributing the documents to the Supreme Soviet Presidium of the [[USSR]], and the governments and media of the thirty-five [[Helsinki Accords#Signatory States|signatories]] of the [[Helsinki Accords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Language Page|url=http://www.mhg.ru/english/18E49C2|website=Moscow Helsinki Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, Helsinki groups were established in [[Ukrainian Helsinki Group|Ukraine]], [[Lithuanian Helsinki Group|Lithuania]], Georgia, and Armenia respectively.

===The International Helsinki Federation===

As the Helsinki groups were forming inside the [[USSR]], the [[Worker's Defense Committee]] was founded in [[Poland]] in September 1976. Quickly following, on 1 January 1977, [[Charter 77]] was established in [[Czechoslovakia]]. Although not labeled “Helsinki”, these groups focused on human rights issues and the accountability of their respective State constitutions and signatures on the [[Helsinki Accords]]. In September 1979 the [[Helsinki Watch Group]] was formed, and other Helsinki-labeled watchdog organizations were created throughout the thirty-five [[Helsinki Accords#Signatory States|signatory States]] of the [[Helsinki Accords]].

In 1982, after an appeal by [[Andrei Sakharov|Dr. Andrei Sakharov]], in his 1978 book Alarm and Hope, for “a unified international committee to defend all Helsinki Watch Group members”, a number of Helsinki committees held an International Citizens Helsinki Watch Conference in [[Lake Como]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Helsinki Watch Conference|url=http://www.parallelarchive.org/document/3986/viewfull|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, as these groups were meeting and creating a new organization, the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] was forced to disband and almost all its members were arrested. The year before the conference, the U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee—later [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/75134|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—traveled throughout Eastern and Western Europe seeking out groups and individuals interested in forming an [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|International Helsinki Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Helsinki Watch Conference|url=http://www.parallelarchive.org/document/3986/viewfull|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 1982, member groups from [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]] formed the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|International Helsinki Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Helsinki Watch Conference|url=http://www.parallelarchive.org/document/3986/viewfull|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main goal was to create Helsinki Committees in all thirty-five [[Helsinki Accords]] [[Helsinki Accords#Signatory States|signatory States]]. The establishment of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee was announced on 11 November 1988, and predominantly organized by the founding members of [[Charter 77]].

===The Czech Helsinki Committee===

Organizing the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee along with [[Charter 77]] was, the [[History of Czechoslovakia#Dissent and independent activity (1970s and 1980s)|Jazz Section]], the Association for Friendship between the [[ČSSR]] and the [[US]], the Independent Peace Association and the [[Velvet Revolution#November 19|Democratic Initiative]]. The history of the Czech Helsinki Committee is undeniably intertwined with the legacy of other distinguished human rights organizations such as the [[OSCE]], [[Charter 77]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]. In fact, the first chairperson of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee was [[Jiří Hájek]], a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and one of the co-founders of [[Charter 77]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Helsinki Committee Established in Prague; Authorities Crack Down on Independent Seminar|url=http://www.parallelarchive.org/document/3539?terms=Helsinki%3BCommittee%3BEstablished%3Bin%3BPrague%3B|website=Parallel Archive|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Velvet Revolution]] of November 1989 and the split of [[Czechoslovakia]], the Czech Helsinki and [[Slovak Helsinki Committee]] were reformed as separate groups. The Czech Helsinki Committee continued working closely with other Helsinki committees and consulting with the [[Council of Europe]]. From monitoring and educating on [[Human Rights]], to counseling centers and legal services the Czech Helsinki Committee continued to grow, and even spawned a separate Refugee Counseling Center and Citizenship Counseling Center. The mission today is similar and branching out to encompass areas such as prisoner's rights, women and children's rights, and asylum seekers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7280">'''Data farming'''  is the process of using designed computational experiments to “grow” data, which can then be analyzed using statistical and visualization techniques to obtain insight into complex systems.  These methods can be applied to any computational model.

Data farming differs from [[Data mining]], as the following metaphors indicate: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Miners seek valuable nuggets of ore buried in the earth, but have no control over what is out there or how hard it is to extract the nuggets from their surroundings. ...  Similarly, data miners seek to uncover valuable nuggets of information buried within massive amounts of data.  Data-mining techniques use statistical and graphical measures to try to identify interesting correlations or clusters in the data set.

Farmers cultivate the land to maximize their yield.  They manipulate the environment to their advantage using irrigation, pest control, crop rotation, fertilizer, and more.  Small-scale designed experiments let them determine whether these treatments are effective.  Similarly, data farmers manipulate simulation models to their advantage, using large-scale designed experimentation to grow data from their models in a manner that easily lets them extract useful information. ...the results can reveal root cause-and-effect relationships between the model input factors and the model responses, in addition to rich graphical and statistical views of these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=T. W.|last2=Kelton|first2=W. D.|last3=Sanchez|first3=P. J.|last4=Sanchez|first4=S. M.|last5=Anderson|first5=B.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A NATO modeling and simulation task group has documented the data farming process in the [https://www.cso.nato.int/Pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=STO-TR-MSG-088 Final Report of MSG-088].
Here, data farming uses collaborative processes in combining rapid scenario prototyping, simulation modeling, design of experiments, high performance computing, and analysis and visualization in an iterative [http://www.datafarming.org/Data_Farming/Welcome.html loop-of-loops].

==History==
The science of [[Design of Experiments]] (DOE) has been around for over a century, pioneered by [[R.A. Fisher]] for agricultural studies. Many of the classic experiment designs can be used in simulation studies. However, computational experiments have far fewer restrictions than do real-world experiments, in terms of costs, number of factors, time required, ability to replicate, ability to automate, etc.  Consequently, a framework specifically oriented toward large-scale simulation experiments is warranted.

People have been conducting computational experiments for as long as computers have been around.  The term “data farming” is more recent, coined in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandstein|first1=A.|last2=Horne|first2=G.|title=Data Farming:  A Meta-Technique for Research in the 21st Century|journal=Maneuver Warfare Science|date=1998|publisher=Marine Corps Combat Development Command|location=Quantico, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the Marine Corp’s [http://projectalbert.org Project Albert], in which small agent-based distillation models (a type of stochastic simulation) were created to capture specific military challenges. These models were run thousands or millions of times at the [https://www.mhpcc.hpc.mil/ Maui High Performance Computer Center] and other facilities. Project Albert analysts would work with the military subject matter experts to refine the models and interpret the results.

Initially, the use of brute-force [[Factorial experiment|full factorial]] (gridded) designs meant that the simulations needed to run very quickly and the studies required [[high-performance computing]]. Even so, only a small number of factors (at a limited number of levels) could be investigated, due to the [[curse of dimensionality]].

The [http://harvest.nps.edu SEED Center for Data Farming] at the [http://www.nps.edu/ Naval Postgraduate School] also worked closely with Project Albert in model generation, output analysis, and the creation of new [[Design of experiments|experimental designs]] to better leverage the computing capabilities at Maui and other facilities. Recent breakthroughs in designs specifically developed for data farming can be found in

among others.

==Workshops==
A series of international data farming workshops have been held since 1998 by the [http://harvest.nps.edu SEED Center for Data Farming]. International Data Farming Workshop 1 occurred in 1991, and since then 16 more workshops have taken place. The workshops have seen a diverse array of representation from participating countries, such as Canada, Singapore, Mexico, Turkey, and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Horne, G., &amp; Schwierz, K. (2008). Data farming around the world overview. Paper presented at the 1442-1447. doi:10.1109/WSC.2008.4736222 &lt;/ref&gt;  

The International Data Farming Workshops operate through collaboration between various teams of experts. The most recent workshop held in 2008 saw over 100 teams participating. The teams of data farmers are assigned a specific area of study, such as [[robotics]], [[homeland security]], and [[disaster relief]]. Different forms of data farming are experimented with and utilized by each group, such as the [[Pythagoras ABM]], the Logistics Battle Command model, and the agent-based sensor effector model (ABSEM).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Accessed September 7, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;
({{Lang-en| Green Sprout}}), is the name of a geopolitical project by [[Lithuania]]n thinker [[Kazys Pakštas]] to create a Lithuanian colony in a geopolitically safe area. This semi-independent state was thought to serve as a safe haven for Lithuanians if the [[Republic of Lithuania]] would be occupied. In 1924 Kazys Pakštas considered [[Quebec]] to be the best location for such a colony. Later his attention switched to the [[state of São Paulo]] ([[Brasil]]) (1927), [[Angola]] (1930) and [[Madagascar]]. Efforts to establish a Lithuanian colony in [[Venezuela]] were abandoned due to the unstable political situation there. So finally it was decided to establish the Lithuanian colony in [[British Honduras]]. Meetings to set a land purchase or lease deal with local authorities in British Honduras were held. But due to the rise of an independence movement in British Honduras this project was not realised. The last considered location for Dausuva were the [[Bahamas]], but support for this project was getting weaker and it never came close to realisation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8379">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''De dicto'' and ''de re''}}
'''''De dicto''''' and '''''de re''''' are two phrases used to mark a distinction in [[intensional statement]]s, associated with the intensional operators in many such statements.  The distinction is used regularly in [[metaphysics]] and in [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/DU3YTgyN/Attributive,%20referential,%20de%20dicto%20and%20de%20re.pdf Semantics Archive] discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

The literal translation of the phrase "''de dicto''" is "about what is said",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-dicto&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''de re'' translates as "about the thing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-re?q=de+re&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the Latin locutions may help to elucidate the living meaning of the phrases, in the distinctions they mark. The distinction can be understood by examples of intensional contexts of which three are considered here: a context of thought, a context of desire, and a context of [[modal logic|modality]].

==Context of thought==
There are two possible interpretations of the sentence "Peter believes someone is out to get him".  On one interpretation, 'someone' is unspecific and Peter suffers a general paranoia; he believes that it is true that a person is out to get him, but does not necessarily have any beliefs about who this person may be.  What Peter believes is that the predicate 'is out to get Peter' is satisfied.  This is the ''de dicto'' interpretation.

On the ''de re'' interpretation, 'someone' is specific, picking out some particular individual.  There is some person Peter has in mind, and Peter believes that person is out to get him.

In the context of thought, the distinction helps us explain how people can hold seemingly self-contradictory beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;  Say [[Lois Lane]] believes [[Clark Kent]] is weaker than [[Superman]].  Since Clark Kent is Superman, taken ''de re'', Lois's belief is untenable; the names 'Clark Kent' and 'Superman' pick out an individual in the world, and a person (or super-person) cannot be stronger than himself.  Understood ''de dicto'', however, this may be a perfectly reasonable belief, since Lois is not aware that Clark and Superman are one and the same.

==Context of desire==

Consider the sentence "Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County". It could be read either ''de dicto'' or ''de re''; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County, whoever he might be.  On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is that a certain situation should obtain, namely, ''Jana's marrying the tallest man in Fulsom County''.  The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how it is to be achieved.  The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be the tallest man in Fulsom County.  Her desire is for ''that man'', and she desires herself to marry ''him''.  Again, the first interpretation, "Jana desires that she marry the tallest man in Fulsom County", is the ''de dicto'' interpretation. The second interpretation, "Of the tallest man in Fulsom County, Jana desires that she marry him", is the ''de re'' interpretation.

Another way to understand the distinction is to ask what Jana would want if the man who was the tallest man in Fulsom County, at the time the original statement was made, were to lose his accolade to a 9 foot tall immigrant, such that he was no longer the tallest man in Fulsom County.  If she continued to want to marry that man &amp;ndash; and, importantly, perceived this as representing no change in her desires &amp;ndash; then she could be taken to have meant the original statement in a ''de re'' sense.  If she no longer wanted to marry that man but instead wanted to marry the ''new'' tallest man in Fulsom County, and saw this as a continuation of her earlier desire, then she meant the original statement in a ''de dicto'' sense.

==Context of modality==
The number of discovered [[chemical element]]s is 118. Take the sentence "The number of chemical elements is necessarily greater than 100". Again, there are two interpretations as per the ''de dicto''/''de re'' distinction. According to the ''de dicto'' interpretation, even if the inner workings of the atom could differ, there could not be fewer than 100 elements. The second interpretation, ''de re'', is that things could not have gone differently with the number 118 turning out to be fewer than 100. Intuitively, this claim is true. Of all the ways the world could have turned out, presumably there are no possibilities wherein 118 is fewer than 100. That 118 is greater than 100 is a necessary fact. The ''de dicto'' interpretation seems to yield a false statement. The ''de re'' interpretation seems to yield a true statement.

Another example: "The [[President of the USA]] in 2001 could not have been [[Al Gore]]". This claim seems false on a ''de dicto'' reading. Presumably, things could have gone differently, with the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] not [[Bush v. Gore|claiming]] that Bush had won the [[United States presidential election, 2000|election]]. But it looks more plausible on a ''de re'' reading. After all, we might skeptically wonder of [[George W. Bush]] whether ''he'' could have been Al Gore. Indeed, assuming that ''being George Bush'' is an essential feature of George Bush and that this feature is incompatible with being Al Gore, a ''de re'' reading of the statement is true.

==Representing ''de dicto'' and ''de re'' in modal logic==
{{also|Vivid designator}}
In [[modal logic]] the distinction between ''de dicto'' and ''de re'' is one of scope. In ''de dicto'' claims, any existential [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]] are within the scope of the modal operator, whereas in ''de re'' claims the modal operator falls within the scope of the existential quantifier. For example:

{| border="0"
| ''De dicto'':
| &lt;math&gt;\Box \exists{x} Ax&lt;/math&gt;
| Necessarily, some ''x'' is such that it is ''A''
|-
| ''De re'':
| &lt;math&gt;\exists{x} \Box Ax&lt;/math&gt;
| Some ''x'' is such that it is necessarily ''A''
|}

"We too often judge people without having all of the facts... Out paradigms are often incomplete, inaccurate or completely messed up. Therefore, we shouldn't be so quick to judge."

[[Image:Anaerobic digestate.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Acidogenic digestate produced from mixed [[municipal waste]] ]]
'''Digestate''' is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a [[biodegradable]] feedstock. [[Anaerobic digestion]] produces two main products: digestate and [[biogas]]. Digestate is produced both by [[acidogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]] and each has different characteristics.

== Acidogenic digestate ==

Acidogenic digestate is fibrous and consists of structural plant matter including [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]. Acidogenic digestate has high moisture retention properties. The digestate may also contain [[minerals]] and remnants of [[bacteria]].

== Methanogenic digestate ==

Methanogenic digestate is a sludge (sometimes called a liquor). This is often high in nutrients such as [[ammonium]]s and [[phosphate]]s.

==Uses==

The primary use of digestate is as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidogenic digestate provides [[moisture retention]] and organic content for soils. This organic material can break down further, aerobically in [[soil]]. Methanogenic digestate provides nutrients for [[plant]] growth. It can also be used to protect soils against erosion.

Acidogenic digestate can also be used as an [[environmentally friendly]] filler to give structure to [[Plastic compounding|composite plastics]].

Growth trials on digestate originating from mixed waste have showed healthy growth results for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Response to source segregation requirement], www.alexmarshall.me.uk, Retrieved 22.02.07&lt;/ref&gt; Digestate can also be used in intensive greenhouse cultivation of plants, e.g. in [[Digeponics]].

Application of digestate has been shown to inhibit plant diseases and induction of resistance. Digestate application has a direct effect on soil-born diseases, and an indirect effect by stimulation of biological activity.

==Digestate and compost==
Digestate is technically not [[compost]] although it is similar to it in physical and chemical characteristics. Compost is produced by [[aerobic digestion]]- [[Aerobic decomposition|decomposition by aerobes]]. This includes [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] which are able to break down the lignin and cellulose to a greater extent.

==Standards for digestate==
The standard of digestate produced by anaerobic digestion can be assessed on three criteria, chemical, biological and physical aspects. Chemical quality needs to be considered in terms of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminant, persistent organic compounds and the content of macro-elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Depending on their source, biowastes can contain pathogens, which can lead to the spreading of human, animal or plant diseases if not appropriately managed. 

The physical standards of composts includes mainly appearance and odour factors. Whilst physical contamination does not present a problem with regards to human, plant or animal health, contamination (in the form of plastics, metals and ceramics) can cause a negative public perception. Even if the compost is of high quality and all standards are met, a negative public perception of waste-based composts still exists. The presence of visible contaminants reminds users of this.

Quality control of the feedstock is the most important way of ensuring a quality end product. The content and quality of waste arriving on-site should be characterised as thoroughly as possible prior to being supplied.

In the UK the [[Publicly Available Specification]] (called PAS110) governs the definition of digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of source-segregated biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrap.org.uk/ad WRAP Anaerobic Digestion Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The specification ensures all digested materials are of consistent quality and fit for purpose. If a biogas plant meets the standard, its digestate will be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste, and it can be sold with the name “Bio- fertiliser”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/standards-agri.html UK's Official Information Portal on Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas, Digestate Standards Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
'''Disability hate crime''' is a form of [[hate crime]] arising from the hostility of the perpetrator towards the [[disability]], or perceived disability, of the victim, or because of their perceived connection to disability. It is often viewed politically as a logical extreme of [[ableism]] (sometimes known in the UK by the disputed word "disablism"), carried through into criminal acts against the person. This phenomenon can take many forms, from [[verbal abuse]] and [[intimidation|intimidatory behaviour]] to [[vandalism]], [[assault]], or even [[murder]]. Disability hate crimes may take the form of one-off incidents, or may represent systematic abuse which continues over periods of weeks, months or even years.

Disability hate crime may occur between strangers who have never met, between acquaintances or within the family. The two key requirements for an act to be called a "disability hate crime" are that it is motivated in part or whole by prejudice against someone because of disability; and second, that the act is actually a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) "Disability Hate Crimes: Does Anyone Really Hate Disabled People?" Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition==
[[Ken Macdonald|Sir Ken Macdonald, QC]], the then [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales]] stated in a speech to the [[Bar Council]] in October 2008 that "I am on record as saying that it is my sense that disability hate crime is very widespread. I have said that it is my view that at the lower end of the spectrum there is a vast amount not being picked up. I have also expressed the view that the more serious disability hate crimes are not always being prosecuted as they should be. This is a scar on the conscience of criminal justice. And all bodies and all institutions involved in the delivery of justice, including my own, share the responsibility." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_/#a16|title=Error 404 (page not found): The Crown Prosecution Service|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the ''[[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]'' of 2009 expanded the [[Hate crimes in the United States#Federal prosecution of hate crimes|1969 United States federal hate-crime law]] to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ Obama Signs Defense Policy Bill That Includes 'Hate Crime' Legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030123045/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], disability hate crime is regarded as an aggravating factor under Section 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], allowing a heavier tariff to be used in sentencing than the crime might draw without the hate elements. Section 146 states that the sentencing provisions apply if:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

The test in Section 146 is deliberately one for evidence of 'hostility' rather than 'hatred' as the seriousness of the offence was considered to justify the application of a less-strict test.

== Crime recording ==
The historical failure of police forces, prosecutors and some social care organizations to treat disability hate crime as a serious issue, an echo of previous failures over other forms of hate crime, particularly racial and [[Violence against LGBT  people|LGBT-focused hate crimes]], has led to chronic under-reporting. This under-reporting is both pre-emptive, through a widespread belief within the disabled community that they will not be treated seriously by law enforcement, and post-facto, where police forces investigate the crime as non hate-based and record it as such.

The UK [[Crown Prosecution Service]]'s Annual Hate Crime Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/disability.html|title=The CPS : Disability hate crime|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that 11,624 cases of racial or religious hate crime were prosecuted in England and Wales in 2009 with 10,690 leading to successful convictions. By contrast only 363 prosecutions and 299 convictions were for disability hate crimes.

The UK charity [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] has conducted research into the prevalence and experience of disability hate crime, summarizing their findings and those of other disability groups in the report ''Getting Away With Murder'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scope.org.uk/About-Us/Research-and-Policy/Publication-directory/Getting-away-with-murder&lt;/ref&gt;  Katharine Quarmby, who wrote the report and was the first British journalist to investigate disability hate crime, has also written a book on the matter.&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people." ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceived vulnerability ==
The treatment of disability hate crimes has been affected by the perception of disabled people as inherently [[vulnerability|vulnerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-16/young-victim-blaming-at-its-very-worst/5745346|title=Disability and murder: victim blaming at its very worst|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multi-faceted issue. Unfounded application of the 'vulnerable' label to a disabled person is considered a form of infantilization, a type of ableism in which disabled people are regarded as childlike, rather than as functioning adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} 

Perceptions of [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] can also lead to the perception that the victim is partially or entirely responsible for the crime. For example, a disabled person may be perceived as having been at fault due to being alone after dark, i.e. engaged in risky behaviour. This pattern of [[victim blaming]] has also appeared in the prosecution of rape and other sexual crimes.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the vulnerability of victims is a key factor in all crimes. It has been applied to wide variety of scenarios, including people working at night or handling large amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) Disability Hate Crimes: Does anyone really hate disabled people? Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Prosecution Service has issued guidance to its prosecutors reminding them that 'vulnerable' should only be used as a description of a person within the precise legal meaning of the term - for instance, as defined in section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_ Guidance on the distinction between vulnerability and hostility in the context of crimes committed against disabled people&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]] and [[gender studies]], "'''doing gender'''" is the idea that in [[Western civilization|Western culture]], [[gender]], rather than being an innate quality of individuals, is a [[psychological conditioning|psychologically ingrained]] [[social construct]] that actively surfaces in everyday human interaction.  This term was used by [[Candace West]] and Don Zimmerman in their article "'''Doing Gender'''", published in 1987 in ''[[Gender and Society]]''.  According to this paper, an individual's performance of gender is intended to construct gendered behavior as naturally occurring.  This façade furthers a system through which individuals are judged in terms of their failure or success to meet gendered societal expectations, called the accountability structure.  The concept of doing gender was later expanded by authors such as West and Fenstermaker in the book ''Doing Gender, Doing Difference''.  

==Concept==
The concept of "doing" gender came from conversations of gender from sociology and gender studies. The specific term "doing gender" was used in West and Zimmerman's article by the same title, originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  West and Zimmerman illustrate that gender is performed in interactions, and that behaviors are assessed based on socially accepted conceptions of gender.  Rather than focusing on how gender is ingrained in the individual or perpetuated by institutions, West and Zimmerman emphasize the interactional level as a site where gender is invoked and reinforced.  They begin by differentiating [[sex]] from sex category and [[gender]].  In this piece, sex is the socially agreed upon criteria for being male or female, usually based on and individual's [[genitalia]] at birth or chromosomal typing before birth.  Sex category is the assumed biological category, regardless of the individual's gender identification. This is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;{{rp|127}}  Gender, in this context, is the degree to which an actor is masculine or feminine, in light of societal expectations about what is appropriate for one's sex category.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Doing gender according to West and Zimmerman "is to advance a new understanding of gender as a routine accomplishment embedded in every day interaction".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  Essentially, West and Zimmerman argued that gender is something that humans created.  As humans, we have categorized and defined many aspects of life.  If someone was not in favor of their gender role or did something that was not deemed "correct" for that gender this person would be committing an act of social deviance.

Gender is described as 'omnirelevant,' as it is apparent and relevant in almost every interaction.  In their article, West and Zimmerman use examples such as bathrooms, sports, coupling, conversations, professions and the might have been{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} division of labor to illustrate the ways in which gender is prevalent in many taken for granted activities.  West and Zimmerman employ the example of a professional woman in a male-dominated field, through which it becomes apparent that the woman will have to make decisions as to whether or not she should engage in "unfeminine" behavior that would otherwise be an integral part of her identity.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Another component of this theory is gendered assessment of behavior.  In the above example, the woman is engaging in behavior that will be assessed as either masculine or feminine by her co-workers.  According to West and Zimmerman, this woman will be evaluated based on how her actions compare to accountability standards of the sex category she belongs to.  Deviations from these expectations do not have an immediate effect on the accountability structure itself.  Instead, failures to meet these standards are attributed to the individual rather than to the rigidity of recognized categories.  With this theory, West and Zimmerman stress the importance of social interaction in maintaining the gender structure.  Because individuals "do" and assess gender in interaction, gender is visible in a wide variety of activities such as conversation.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

==Foundations==
The idea that gender is something that individuals actively 'do' was largely inspired by the social psychological approach taken by Erving Goffman (1976) in ''Gender Display''.(p.&amp;nbsp;129)  Goffman theorizes that humans make the assumption that each has an "essential nature," which can be interpreted by reading "natural signs given off or expressed by them" (p.&amp;nbsp;75).  One of the most basic natures that can be assumed from interpreting these signs is one's masculinity or femininity.  Not only is gender often determined by others relatively easily, but this determination often establishes the ways in which individuals interact with one another.  Goffman asserts that, because we habitually function within such scripts, they are taken to be further evidence of essential natures.  He coins the term "gender display" as a way to conceptualize the ways in which individuals act in a gender appropriate manner.  However, these performances are optional and vulnerable to disturbance, as inappropriate gender display can just as easily be invoked as socially accepted ones.  Goffman asserts that there is a "scheduling" of gender displays around activities, so that the activities themselves are not interrupted by gender displays.  For instance, colleagues may interact in a gendered manner during their lunch hour, rather than while they are working together on a project.  West and Zimmerman take issue with this piece of Goffman's perspective, claiming that this masks the ways in which gender displays permeate nearly all social situations in that individuals cannot avoid being interpreted as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

== In the media ==
Media has a powerful influence over many aspects of modern life.  The way gender is expressed and perceived by audiences varies from culture to culture.  The language within a culture as "the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis [states], notes how language influences our perceptions and thus shapes our reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McGrath | first = Karen | title = Teaching sex, gender, transsexual, and transgender concepts | journal = [[National Communication Association#Publications|Communication Teacher]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 96&amp;ndash;101 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | date = 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As language evolves within a culture and new language is added, the gender identities are influenced and categories change.  The influence of language and the significance it has often communicated over media and the gender categories people use to place gender roles in, may change or add new categories.  There are other areas that gender roles and differences stem from, "some researchers suggest that gender differences result from a variety of factors including socialization and biology…gender roles are often manifested through communication and culture (Goffman, 1976; Lauzen et al., 2008; Wanta &amp; Legett, 1989; Williams &amp; Best, 1990; Wood, 2009)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Jessica | last2 = Mackey-Kallis | first2 = Susan | last3 = Shyles | first3 = Len | last4 = Barry | first4 = Kelly | last5 = Biagini | first5 = Danielle | last6 = Hart | first6 = Colleen | last7 = Jack | first7 = Lauren | title = Face it: the impact of gender on social media images | journal = [[Communication Quarterly]] | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 588&amp;ndash;607 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender is something that is always out there whether we are mindful of it or not: "Gender identity and gender roles are a significant part of everyday life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On top of this, gender roles help us make sense of our environment, they influence relationships and our own views.  Since the social aspect of life is such an essential part and needs to be fulfilled, we are exposed to gender roles frequently and sometimes unconsciously, absorbing it if it fits with the category that society has influenced us to perceive it as.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "In contemporary media and culture, women's and men's social desirability and gender often been defined in terms of their bodies. For women this has often involved comparing themselves to and even replicating the 'thin ideal'."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These views like the 'thin ideal' are reinforced through media with advertising, actors, and Photoshop touchups.  On the other end, men have been shown images of being extremely fit and muscular, usually in a pose that expresses power, and the cultures values of what 'masculinity' is for a culture.  "Gender-based definitions of success frequently revolve around presenting or developing their bodies as strong, youthful, active and physically dominant."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These roles are promoted by society, with visual displays and traits assigned to specific gender roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "Goffman (1976) accounts for these traits in his research of magazine and newspaper photography, finding women to be pictured in more submissive positions while men are depicted in more elevated positions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These depictions of gender are growing in certain trending shows and movies. Lauzen and colleagues (2008) examined gender roles in television, "they found male characters on prime time television were more likely to inhabit work roles, including blue collar, white collar, and extracurricular activities, while women were portrayed in more interpersonal roles involving romance, friendship, and family."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are portrayed in TV can spill into everyday life. Another area that 'doing gender' is being expressed is in video games: "Female characters are represented as highly sexualized while male characters possess exaggerated strength, are hyper masculine, aggressive, and, with the exception of showing hostility, lack emotion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are represented in video games adds another influence that society has to take in and this can make people think that these fictional depictions can be obtained. This then creates perspectives used to categorize gender roles and as we see others 'doing gender' we want to believe that we should be looking like these characters in games or actors in advertisements and T.V. "A number of studies, for example, have demonstrated extensive 'gender-swapping' in 'avatar' creation for online gaming and in text based CMC."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in video games and in especially online environments allow people to step into other gender roles, by 'doing gender' that may be different in how they present themselves in real life. These online environments allow users to shape their roles in gender.

===Social media and dating ===
The rise of [[social media]] networks allows people to communicate globally and manage how others perceive them and how they choose to express their gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The increase of digital content in today's technology has influences over gender roles, "Digital formats…represent exciting possibilities for individuals who can explore the freedom of presenting a physical self that might differ from the one they present or perform in everyday life or form socially-defines expectations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  People will put themselves into a role to look as though they fit in and to avoid embarrassment in case they violate a social norm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Responses and critiques==
{{main|Gender performativity}}
[[Judith Butler]] has written extensively on this topic, using the term "gender performativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= June 2011 |access-date = 4 May 2016 | title= Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/your-behavior-creates-your-gender}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She explains the same idea of doing gender by explaining gender as a performance that people are taught and attempt to recreate through actions and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Butler|first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | chapter = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GNNww3jmH3kC&amp;pg=PA278 | editor-last = Case | editor-first = Sue-Ellen | title = Performing feminisms: feminist critical theory and theatre| page = 278 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780801839696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of doing gender has been critiqued by scholars who assert that it does not take human agency and acts of resistance into account.&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt; 

In order to illustrate the possibility of change, several works have been published in which researchers claim to document an 'undoing' or 'redoing' of gender.  Francine M. Deutsch, in "Undoing Gender" (2007), examines how the concept of doing gender has been employed in research.  Deutsch uses examples of studies that use West and Zimmerman's work to illustrate how normative gender ideals are apparent in a variety of contexts.  This, she argues, contributes to the invisibility of gender transgression and does not work towards West and Zimmerman's goal of eliminating gender inequity.  In order to facilitate the undoing of gender, Deutsch suggests that "The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered; (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions; (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality; (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change; and (5) interaction as the site of change" (p.&amp;nbsp;114).  By focusing on these areas, Deutsch asserts, it is easier to find practical solutions to problems cause by gender inequity.&lt;ref name="Undoing" /&gt;

Catherine Connell (2010) presented the idea of "redoing gender" as well as "doing [[transgender]]" in her work, "Doing, Undoing or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople".  Connell posits that transpeople may redo gender by altering normative ideas of gender in their interactions, but may simultaneously participate in the doing of gender in other ways.  Connell coins the term "doing transgender" in order to provide a way to examine how transpeople must make sense of the disconnect between sex, gender and sex category, which they may obscure or actively express in interactions.&lt;ref name="Redoing" /&gt;

In January 2009, the academic journal ''Gender and Society'' published a West and Zimmerman Symposium, in honor of the concept of doing gender.  Nine short articles were composed for the symposium, including a piece by West and Zimmerman.  Several authors argued that the doing gender framework did not allow for agency, intent or consciousness.  Other authors argued that biology needed to be focused on when considering doing gender, in order to understand what role the body plays in gender assessment.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mess" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raewyn" /&gt;

West and Zimmerman responded with an article titled "Accounting for Doing Gender", in which they restated their original argument, with an emphasis on accountability.  In this, they argued, the doing gender framework does not hide agency, but contextualizes it.  Because individuals' gender will be interpreted based on the accountability structure, the effectiveness of their resistance may not serve to "undo" gender.  The authors contend that gender may be "redone" but never "undone", as accountability structures may change but gender will not disappear.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;

== Doing difference ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}
'''Doing difference''' is a concept&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt; that grew out of the authors' earlier idea of "doing gender", presented at the American Sociological Association in 1977 by Candace West and Don Zimmerman and published in  ''Gender and Society'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; In 1995, Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker sought to extend the idea of gender as an ongoing interactional process into the realms of race and class.

They begin by asserting that the intersection of these three fundamental ways to categorize social difference cannot{{clarify|date=May 2018}} simply be thought of in a mathematical or even strictly hierarchical sense.  That is, simply plugging in these concepts as variables in a multiple regression model to predict life success in a particular society provides a simplified way to look at their relative effects, but would fail to provide an adequate basis for even understanding, lesser yet altering systemic inequalities based on race, class, and gender.  For instance, poor black women in the United States face immense social disadvantages, but to place them at the bottom of some abstract listing of vulnerable populations tells us little about how race, class, and gender interacted in their [[biography]] and social milieu to constrain and direct their lives.  Their analysis of these core differences from the standpoint of [[ethnomethodology]] turns the focus away from individual characteristics.  Instead, they are understood processually as "emergent properties of social situations" which simultaneously produce systematically different outcomes for social groups and the rationale for such disparities.

The authors assert that the reason [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] were not adequately considered in earlier works is because the [[feminist movement]] has historically been the province of white middle class women in the developed world who were not sufficiently affected or attuned to the nature of these corollary oppressions.  Furthermore, few women outside this privileged lot were able to gain access to institutions of higher education, which might have permitted them to engage in the academic discourse and activity about such shortcomings.  Even if they had, the [[gatekeeper]]s within the academy and at leading journals made this unlikely process even more difficult.  Perhaps overt racism and [[classism]] (and [[sexism]]) is less apparent today in these institutions, but the tendency remains for those in positions of power to view the world in a way that discounts the experience of marginalized groups.

The central theme of "difference" here is meant to illustrate how the concepts of race and gender have been falsely conceived as biologically bound predictors of behavior and aptitude among those who are a certain skin color or sex.  The commonalities within these somewhat arbitrary categories often exaggerated and the behavior of the most dominant group within the category (e.g. rich white men or women) becomes idealized as the only appropriate way to fulfill one social role.  This conceptualization is then employed as a means of excluding and stigmatizing those who do not or cannot live up to these standards.  This process of "doing difference" is realized in constant interpersonal interactions that reaffirm and reproduce social structure.  Experiencing the world through the interaction of these "essentialized" characteristics and especially through dominant group's frame of reference (power interests) produces a pattern of thought and behavior that reproduces these social inequalities.

Social science research has rendered dubious any claim that race can simply be conflated with color, or gender with genitalia, or even class with paychecks.  Class may not seem as prone to ideas about natural social differentiation, but within capitalist societies, it is often assumed that one's economic situation is a more or less direct indication of one's capacity to achieve.  Since women and people of color taken are more often poor, natural disadvantage is at least tacitly assumed by many.  Given the general observation that powerful groups seem to rely heavily on these ideas of natural subordination, many liberationist thinkers came to the conclusion that this essentialism would be a prime rhetorical vehicle to subvert.  Thus, the [[deconstruction]] of [[role theory]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] within sociology was a central theme from the 1960s onward.  This still left a somewhat gaping theoretical vacuum, one that continues to be felt by people struggling with this challenge to fundamentally alter their social cosmology.

[[Social constructionism]] has assumed the major explanatory role in these discussions by positing that the meanings of these supposedly [[ascribed status]]es are in fact situationally dependent on the sort of social context in which we employ them.  That is, race, class, and gender aren't just objective scientific facts, but dynamic processes of culturally constructing cues for moral behavior (for which one can be held personally accountable) in a particular circumstance.  It is these constantly occurring processes, not some divinely decreed grand plan, which reproduces social structure.  Individuals "do difference" when they acknowledge (knowingly or unknowingly) how their categorization renders them socially accountable to acting in a particular way in a situation.  However, when individuals recalibrate "doing difference" to produce alternative ways to conceptualize interaction patterns, it amounts to social change.

Some research has looked into genetics when considering ''déjà vu''. Although there is not currently a gene associated with ''déjà vu'', the LGII gene on [[chromosome 10]] is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, ''déjà vu'', along with [[jamais vu]], occurs often enough during seizures (such as [[simple partial seizure]]s) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brynie|first=Faith|title=Brain Sense: The Science of the Senses and How We Process the World Around Us|year=2009|publisher=Amacom|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Certain drugs increase the chances of ''déjà vu'' occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of ''déjà vu''. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study.

==Explanations==

=== Memory-based explanation ===
Research has associated ''déjà vu'' experiences with good memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adachi | first1 = N. | last2 = Adachi | first2 = T. | last3 = Kimura | first3 = M. | last4 = Akanuma | first4 = N. | last5 = Takekawa | first5 = Y. | last6 = Kato | first6 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Demographic and psychological features of déjà vu experiences in a nonclinical Japanese population | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 242–247 | doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061149.26296.dc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity between a ''déjà-vu''-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.&lt;ref name="Brown20042"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cleary AM|year=2008|title=Recognition memory, familiarity and déjà vu experiences |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5|pages=353–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00605.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that ''cannot be remembered'' may lead to ''déjà vu''.

In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941)&lt;ref name="Banister1941a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced olfactory paramnesia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]]|volume=32|pages=155–175 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banister1941b"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced visual paramnesias |journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=32|pages=30–51 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[hypnosis]] to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in 3 of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed "paramnesias".

Memory-based explanations may lead to the development of a number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of ''déjà vu'' can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that ''déjà vu'' may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing ''déjà vu'' in laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"/&gt;

A 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''déjà vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''déjà vu'' experience.&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to déjà vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969–975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.

Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''déjà vu'' is the occurrence of "[[cryptomnesia]]", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as "''déjà vu''". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''déjà vu'') involves achieving a good "match" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we "know" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|work=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''déjà vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and déjà  vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|pages=403–424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How Déjà Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream-based explanation===
One theory of ''déjà vu'' attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=0-7624-1962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spontaneity of these types of ''déjà vu'' "moments"  can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, to the point where they are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.

===''Jamais vu''===
{{Main|Jamais vu }}

''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning "never seen") is a term in psychology which is used to describe any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.

Often described as the opposite of ''déjà vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

Theoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.&lt;ref name="moulin"/&gt; If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very "reality of reality", are termed depersonalisation (or [[surreality]]) feelings.

The feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word.&lt;ref name="moulin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Effect algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s of a kind introduced by D.&amp;nbsp;Foulis and M.&amp;nbsp;Bennett&lt;ref&gt;D. Foulis and M. Bennett. "Effect algebras and unsharp quantum logics", ''Found. Phys.'', 24(10):1331–1352, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a framework for unsharp measurements in [[quantum mechanics]].

An effect algebra consists of an underlying set ''A'' equipped with a partial binary operation ⊞, a unary operation (−)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;, and two special elements 0, 1 such that the following relationships hold:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Roumen, "Cohomology of effect algebras" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00567v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* The binary operation is commutative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' is defined, then so is ''b'' ⊞ ''a'', and they are equal.
* The binary operation is associative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' are defined, then so are ''b'' ⊞ ''c'' and ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c''), and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' = ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c'').
* The zero element behaves as expected: 0 ⊞ ''a'' is always defined and equals ''a''.
* The unary operation is an orthocomplementation: for each ''a'' ∈ ''A'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; is the unique element of ''A'' for which ''a'' ⊞ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
* A zero-one law holds: if ''a'' ⊞ 1 is defined, then ''a'' = 0.

Every effect algebra carries a natural [[partial order|order]]:  define ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an element ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ⊞ ''c''}} exists and is equal to&amp;nbsp;''b''. The defining axioms of effect algebras guarantee that&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;is a partial order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = 1602.00567| title = Cohomology of effect algebras | date = 2016-02-02 | last = Roumen | first = Frank | doi=10.4204/EPTCS.236.12 | volume=236 | journal=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science | pages=174–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the physiological term|Compliance (physiology)}}
'''Electrical elastance''' is the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of [[capacitance]].  The [[SI]] unit of elastance is the inverse [[farad]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The concept is not widely used by electrical and electronic engineers.  The value of [[capacitor]]s is invariably specified in units of capacitance rather than inverse capacitance.  However, it is used in theoretical work in network analysis and has some niche applications at [[microwave]] frequencies.

The term ''elastance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] through the analogy of a capacitor as a spring. The term is also used for analogous quantities in some other energy domains.  It maps to [[stiffness]] in the mechanical domain, and is the inverse of [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] in the fluid flow domain, especially in [[physiology]].  It is also the name of the generalised quantity in [[bond-graph]] analysis and other schemes analysing systems across multiple domains.

==Usage==
The definition of capacitance (''C'') is the charge (''Q'') stored per unit voltage (''V'').

:&lt;math&gt; C = {Q \over V} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

Elastance (''S'') is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of capacitance, thus,

:&lt;math&gt; S = {V \over Q} \ . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camara, p.16–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressing the values of [[capacitor]]s as elastance is not done much by practical electrical engineers, although it is sometimes convenient for capacitors in series.  The total elastance is simply the sum of the individual elastances in that case.  However, it is used by network theorists in their analysis.  One advantage is that an increase in elastance increases [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  This is in the same direction as the other two basic passive [[Electrical element|elements]], [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[inductance]].  An example of the use of elastance can be found in the 1926 doctoral thesis of [[Wilhelm Cauer]].  On his path to founding [[network synthesis]] he formed the [[mesh analysis|loop matrix]] '''A''',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}= s^2 \mathbf{L} + s \mathbf{R} + \mathbf{S} = s \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''L''', '''R''', '''S''' and '''Z''' are the network loop matrices of inductance, resistance, elastance and impedance respectively and ''s'' is [[complex frequency]].  This expression would be significantly more complicated if Cauer had tried to use a matrix of capacitances instead of elastances.  The use of elastance here is merely for mathematical convenience, in much the same way as mathematicians use [[radian]]s rather than the more common units for angles.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Mathis &amp; Pauli, p.4&lt;br/&gt;The symbols in Cauer's expression have been modified for consistency within this article and with modern practice&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastance is also used in [[microwave engineering]].  In this field [[varactor diode]]s are used as a voltage variable capacitor in [[frequency multiplier]]s, [[parametric amplifier]]s and variable [[electronic filter|filters]].  These diodes store a charge in their [[p-n junction|junction]] when [[reverse bias]]ed which is the source of the capacitor effect.  The slope of the voltage-stored charge curve is called ''differential elastance'' in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Harrison &amp; Lippens, pp.29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
The [[SI]] unit of elastance is the reciprocal [[farad]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The term ''[[daraf]]'' is sometimes used for this unit, but it is not approved by SI and its use is discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Michell, p.168|Mills, p.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is formed by writing ''farad'' backwards, in much the same way as the unit ''[[mho]]'' (unit of conductance, also not approved by SI) is formed by writing ''[[ohm]]'' backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.466&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''daraf'' was coined by [[Arthur E. Kennelly]].  He used it from at least 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kennelly &amp; Kurokawa, p.41|Blake, p.29|Jerrard, p.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The terms ''elastance'' and ''elastivity'' were coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  Heaviside coined a great many of the terms used in [[circuit analysis]] today, such as [[electrical impedance|impedance]], [[inductance]], [[admittance]], and [[electrical conductance|conductance]].  Heaviside's terminology followed the model of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[resistivity]] with the ''-ance'' ending used for [[extensive properties]] and the ''-ivity'' ending used for [[intensive properties]].  The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the "values" of components) and the intensive properties are used in [[field (physics)|field analysis]].  Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance.  It is the reciprocal of [[permittivity]].  As Heaviside put it,
{{blockquote|Permittivity gives rise to permittance, and elastivity to elastance.&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;|Oliver Heaviside}}
Here, ''permittance'' is Heaviside's term for capacitance.  He did not like any term that suggested that a [[capacitor]] was a container for holding charge.  He rejected the terms ''capacity'' (capacitance) and ''capacious'' (capacitive) and their inverses ''incapacity'' and ''incapacious''.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms current in his time for a capacitor were ''condenser'' (suggesting that the "electric fluid" could be condensed out) and ''leyden''&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Leyden jar]], an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage.  Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, pp.150–151&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference was a result of Heaviside following [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it.  In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the [[electromotive force]] and is the analogue of [[velocity]] caused by a mechanical [[force]].  At the capacitor, this current causes a "[[displacement current|displacement]]" whose rate of change is equal to the current.  The displacement is viewed as an electric [[deformation (mechanics)#Strain|strain]], like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring.  The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates.  This is replaced with the concept of [[divergence]] of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, pp.150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, some authors followed Heaviside in the use of ''elastance'' and ''elastivity''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Peek, p.215, writing in 1915&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the reciprocal quantities ''capacitance'' and ''permittivity'' are almost universally preferred by electrical engineers.  However, elastance does still see some usage by theoretical writers.  A further consideration in Heaviside's choice of these terms was a wish to distinguish them from mechanical terms.  Thus, he chose ''elastivity'' rather than ''[[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]''.  This avoids having to write ''electrical elasticity'' to disambiguate it from ''mechanical elasticity''.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside carefully chose his terms to be unique to [[electromagnetism]], most especially avoiding commonality with [[mechanics]].  Ironically, many of his terms have subsequently been borrowed back into mechanics and other domains in order to name analogous properties.  For instance, it is now necessary to distinguish ''[[electrical impedance]]'' from ''[[mechanical impedance]]'' in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;van der Tweel &amp; Verburg, pp.16–20&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Elastance'' has also been borrowed back into mechanics for the analogous quantity by some authors, but often ''[[stiffness]]'' is the preferred term instead.  However, ''elastance'' is widely used for the analogous property in the domain of [[fluid dynamics]], especially in the fields of [[biomedicine]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;see for instance Enderle &amp; Bronzino, pp.197–201, especially equation 4.72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical analogy==
[[Mechanical-electrical analogies]] are formed by comparing the mathematical description of the two systems.  Quantities that appear in the same place in equations of the same form are called ''analogues''.  There are two main reasons for forming such analogies.  The first is to allow electrical phenomena to be explained in terms of the more familiar mechanical systems.  For instance, an electrical [[RLC circuit|inductor-capacitor-resistor circuit]] has [[differential equation]]s of the same form as a mechanical mass-spring-damper system.  In such cases the electrical domain is converted to the mechanical domain.  The second, and more important, reason is to allow a system containing both mechanical and electrical parts to be analysed as a unified whole.  This is of great benefit in the fields of [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]].  In such cases the mechanical domain is most often converted to the electrical domain because [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]] in the electrical domain is highly developed.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp.17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Maxwellian analogy===
In the analogy developed by Maxwell, now known as the [[impedance analogy]], [[voltage]] is made analogous to [[force]].  The voltage of a source of electric power is still called [[electromotive force]] for this reason.  Current is analogous to [[velocity]].  The [[time derivative]] of distance (displacement) is equal to velocity and the time derivative of momentum is equal to force.  Quantities in other energy domains that are in this same differential relationship are called respectively ''generalised displacement'', ''generalised velocity'', ''generalised momentum'', and ''generalised force''.  In the electrical domain, it can be seen that the generalised displacement is charge, explaining the Maxwellians' use of the term ''displacement''.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Since elastance is the ratio of voltage over charge, then it follows that the analogue of elastance in another energy domain is the ratio of a generalised force over a generalised displacement.  Thus, an elastance can be defined in any energy domain.  ''Elastance'' is used as the name of the generalised quantity in the formal analysis of systems with multiple energy domains, such as is done with [[bond graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vieil, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other analogies===
Maxwell's analogy is not the only way that analogies can be constructed between mechanical and electrical systems.  There are any number of ways to do this.  One very common system is the [[mobility analogy]].  In this analogy force maps to current instead of voltage.  Electrical impedance no longer maps to mechanical impedance, and likewise, electrical elastance no longer maps to mechanical elastance.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">'''Feminist biology''' is an approach to [[biology]] that is concerned with the influence of gender values, the removal of gender bias, and the understanding of the overall role of social values in biological research and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work “Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women” and inspired the university’s endowed fellowship for feminist biology),&lt;ref&gt;David, Tenembaum. "First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology." University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the [[sex and gender distinction|assessment of the meaning of words such as “gender” and “sex.”]]
Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of [[biological determinism]], whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Johnna. "A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology." Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure.

Primate visions: Gender, race, and nature in the world of 
modern science. Psychology Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit.

Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and “come to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.”&lt;ref&gt;Biology and Gender Study Group, et al. "The Importance of Feminist Critique for Contemporary Cell Biology." Hypatia (1988): 61-76.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a general trend of “active” biological description associated with the sperm gamete and “passive” description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2&amp;nbsp;million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a dichotomous lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled “The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.” She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes – even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: “Ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.”&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough." The Sciences Mar/Apr. 1993: 20-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure – which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take.

==Motivation==
The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa. 1999. Has Feminism Changed Science? Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. [[Reductionism]], for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and [[biological determinism]], contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. 

==Controversy==
There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that there sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, "Introduction," Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28, no. 3 (Spring 2003): 859-866.&lt;/ref&gt;. Individuals such as [[Carla Fehr]] offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, a '''field''' is a [[Quantity#Quantity in physical science|physical quantity]], represented by a number or [[tensor]], that has a value for each [[Point (geometry)|point]] in space and time.&lt;ref name=Gribbin&gt;

When a [[test particle|test electric charge]] is placed in this electric field, the particle accelerates due to a force. Physicists have found the notion of a field to be of such practical utility for the analysis of forces that they have come to think of a force as due to a field.&lt;ref name=Feynman102&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard P. Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman| year=1970 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern framework of the [[quantum theory of fields]], even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical "true vacuum".&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;{{cite book |author=John Archibald Wheeler|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics.|publisher=Norton|location=London|year=1998|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This led physicists to consider [[electromagnetic field]]s to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting [[paradigm]] of the edifice of modern physics. "The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have."&lt;ref name=Feynman110&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard P. Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman| year=1970 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the strength of most fields has been found to diminish with distance to the point of being undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravity]] or the [[electrostatic field]] in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow [[Gauss's law]]). One consequence is that the Earth's gravitational field quickly becomes undetectable on cosmic scales.

A field can be classified as a [[scalar field]], a [[vector field]], a [[spinor|spinor field]] or a [[tensor field]] according to whether the represented physical quantity is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], a [[spinor]], or a [[tensor]], respectively. A field has a unique tensorial character in every point where it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. For example, the [[Newtonian gravity|Newtonian]] [[gravitational field]] is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a ''classical field'' or a ''quantum field'', depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]] respectively. In fact in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a [[field particle]], namely a [[boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steven Weinberg |journal=New York Review of Books |date=November 7, 2013 |title=Physics: What We Do and Don’t Know |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
To [[Isaac Newton]], his [[law of universal gravitation]] simply expressed the gravitational [[force]] that acted between any pair of massive objects. When looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the [[Solar System]], dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. In the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. This quantity, the [[gravitational field]], gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. This did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Search for Unity: Notes for a History of Quantum Field Theory

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of [[electromagnetism]]. In the early stages, [[André-Marie Ampère]] and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] could manage with Newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of [[electric charge]]s or [[electric current]]s. However, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s; in 1849 [[Michael Faraday]] became the first to coin the term "field".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

The independent nature of the field became more apparent with [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s discovery that [[electromagnetic wave|waves in these fields]] propagated at a finite speed. Consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

Maxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. Instead, he supposed that the [[electromagnetic field]] expressed the deformation of some underlying medium—the [[luminiferous aether]]—much like the tension in a rubber membrane. If that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. Despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the [[special theory of relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905. This theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other.  They became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory would be the same for all observers. By doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt;

In the late 1920s, the new rules of [[quantum mechanics]] were first applied to the electromagnetic fields. In 1927, [[Paul Dirac]] used [[quantum field]]s to successfully explain how the decay of an [[atom]] to a lower [[quantum state]] lead to the [[spontaneous emission]] of a [[photon]], the quantum of the electromagnetic field. This was soon followed by the realization (following the work of [[Pascual Jordan]], [[Eugene Wigner]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Wolfgang Pauli]]) that all particles, including [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1977/&gt; That said, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and [[Richard Feynman]] seriously considered Newton's pre-field concept of [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]] (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in [[general relativity]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]]).

==Classical fields==
{{Main|Classical field theory}}
There are several examples of [[Classical field theory|classical fields]]. Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. [[Elasticity (physics)|Elasticity]] of materials, [[fluid dynamics]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] are cases in point.

Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with [[Michael Faraday|Faraday's]] [[lines of force]] when describing the [[electric field]]. The [[gravitational field]] was then similarly described.

===Newtonian gravitation===
[[File:Newtonian gravity field (physics).svg|thumb|upright|In [[classical gravitation]], mass is the source of an attractive [[gravitational field]] '''g'''.]]
A classical field theory describing gravity is [[gravitation|Newtonian gravitation]], which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two [[mass]]es.

Any body with mass ''M'' is associated with a [[gravitational field]] '''g''' which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of ''M'' at a point '''r''' in space corresponds to the ratio between force '''F''' that ''M'' exerts on a small or negligible [[test mass]] ''m'' located at '''r''' and the test mass itself:&lt;ref name="kleppner85"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Stipulating that ''m'' is much smaller than ''M'' ensures that the presence of ''m'' has a negligible influence on the behavior of ''M''.

According to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], '''F'''('''r''') is given by&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{G M m}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] lying along the line joining ''M'' and ''m'' and pointing from ''m'' to ''M''. Therefore, the gravitational field of '''M''' is&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal [[equivalence principle#Tests of the weak equivalence principle|to an unprecedented level of accuracy]] leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the [[equivalence principle]], which leads to [[general relativity]].

Because the gravitational force '''F''' is [[conservative field|conservative]], the gravitational field '''g''' can be rewritten in terms of the [[gradient]] of a scalar function, the [[gravitational potential]] Φ('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Electromagnetism}}
[[Michael Faraday]] first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into [[magnetism]]. He realized that [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy.

These ideas eventually led to the creation, by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the [[electromagnetic field]]. The modern version of these equations is called [[Maxwell's equations]].

====Electrostatics====
{{Main|Electrostatics}}

A [[test charge|charged test particle]] with charge ''q'' experiences a force '''F''' based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the [[electric field]] '''E''' so that {{nowrap|'''F''' {{=}} ''q'''''E'''}}. Using this and [[Coulomb's law]] tells us that the electric field due to a single charged particle is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field is [[conservative field|conservative]], and hence can be described by a scalar potential, ''V''('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla V(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

====Magnetostatics====
{{Main|Magnetostatics}}

A steady current ''I'' flowing along a path ''ℓ'' will exert a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by ''I'' on a nearby charge ''q'' with velocity '''v''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt;
where '''B'''('''r''') is the [[magnetic field]], which is determined from ''I'' by the [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{d\boldsymbol{\ell} \times d\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]], '''A'''('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Bottom right:''' '''B''' field due to a pure [[magnetic dipole moment]] '''m''' found in ordinary matter (''not'' from monopoles).]]

====Electrodynamics====
{{Main|Electrodynamics}}

In general, in the presence of both a charge density ρ('''r''', ''t'') and current density '''J'''('''r''', ''t''), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by [[Maxwell's equations]], a set of differential equations which directly relate '''E''' and '''B''' to ρ and '''J'''.&lt;ref name="griffiths326"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials ''V'' and '''A'''. A set of integral equations known as ''[[retarded potential]]s'' allow one to calculate ''V'' and '''A''' from ρ and '''J''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is contingent on the correct choice of [[gauge fixing|gauge]]. ''V'' and '''A''' are not completely determined by ρ and '''J'''; rather, they are only determined up to some scalar function ''f''('''r''', ''t'') known as the gauge. The retarded potential formalism requires one to choose the [[Lorenz gauge]].&lt;/ref&gt; and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations&lt;ref name="wangsness469"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wangsness|first=Roald|title=Electromagnetic Fields|edition=2nd|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} V - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the [[electromagnetic field]] was understood as a collection of two vector fields in space. Nowadays, one recognizes this as a single antisymmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in spacetime.

[[File:em monopoles.svg|size=250|thumb|right| The [[electric field|'''E''' fields]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' fields]] due to [[electric charge]]s (black/white) and [[magnet|magnetic poles]] (red/blue).&lt;ref name="Mc Graw Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Mansfield, C. O’Sullivan 2011"/&gt; '''E''' fields due to stationary electric charges and '''B''' fields due to stationary [[magnetic monopole|magnetic charges]] (note in nature N and S monopoles do not exist). In motion ([[velocity]] '''v'''), an ''electric'' charge induces a '''B''' field while a ''magnetic'' charge (not found in nature) would induce an '''E''' field. [[Conventional current]] is used.]]

===Gravitation in general relativity===
[[File:Relativistic gravity field (physics).svg|350px|left|thumb|In [[general relativity]], mass-energy warps space time ([[Einstein tensor]] '''G'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

Ciufolini |author2=J.A. Wheeler |publisher=Princeton Physics Series|year=1995|isbn=0-691-03323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Einstein's theory of gravity, called [[general relativity]], is another example of a field theory. Here the principal field is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], a symmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in [[spacetime]]. This replaces [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

===Waves as fields===
[[Wave]]s can be constructed as physical fields, due to their [[speed of light|finite propagation speed]] and [[causality|causal nature]] when a simplified [[physical model]] of an [[Physical system#The concept of closed systems in physics|isolated closed system]] is set {{clarify|date=March 2013}}. They are also subject to the [[inverse-square law]].

For electromagnetic waves, there are [[optical field]]s, and terms such as [[Near and far field|near- and far-field]] limits for diffraction. In practice though, the field theories of optics are superseded by the electromagnetic field theory of Maxwell.

==Quantum fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kip Thorne]] --&gt;
{{main|Quantum field theory}}
It is now believed that [[quantum mechanics]] should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding [[quantum field theory]]. For example, [[Quantization (physics)|quantizing]] [[classical electrodynamics]] gives [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; [[experiment]]al [[data]] confirm its predictions to a higher [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] (to more [[significant digit]]s) than any other theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Peskin |first1=Michael E. |last2=Schroeder |first2=Daniel V. |title=An Introduction to Quantum Fields |page=198 |year=1995 |publisher= Westview Press |isbn=0-201-50397-2|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}. Also see [[precision tests of QED]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The two other fundamental quantum field theories are [[quantum chromodynamics]] and the [[electroweak theory]].

[[File:Qcd fields field (physics).svg|400px|right|thumb|Fields due to [[color charge]]s, like in [[quark]]s ('''G''' is the [[gluon field strength tensor]]). These are "colorless" combinations. '''Top:''' Color charge has "ternary neutral states" as well as binary neutrality (analogous to [[electric charge]]). '''Bottom:''' The quark/antiquark combinations.&lt;ref name="Mc Graw Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Mansfield, C. O’Sullivan 2011"/&gt;]]

In quantum chromodynamics, the color field lines are coupled at short distances by [[gluon]]s, which are polarized by the field and line up with it. This effect increases within a short distance (around 1 [[femtometre|fm]] from the vicinity of the quarks) making the color force increase within a short distance, [[Color confinement|confining the quarks]] within [[hadron]]s. As the field lines are pulled together tightly by gluons, they do not "bow" outwards as much as an electric field between electric charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|author1=R. Resnick |author2=R. Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1985|page=684|isbn=978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three quantum field theories can all be derived as special cases of the so-called [[standard model]] of [[particle physics]]. [[General relativity]], the Einsteinian field theory of gravity, has yet to be successfully quantized. However an extension, [[thermal field theory]], deals with quantum field theory at ''finite temperatures'', something seldom considered in quantum field theory.

In [[BRST formalism|BRST theory]] one deals with odd fields, e.g. [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s. There are different descriptions of odd classical fields both on [[graded manifold]]s and [[supermanifold]]s.

As above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before. The equations governing the quantum fields are in fact PDEs (specifically, [[relativistic wave equations]] (RWEs)). Thus one can speak of [[Yang–Mills field|Yang–Mills]], [[Dirac field|Dirac]], [[Klein–Gordon field|Klein–Gordon]] and [[Schrödinger field]]s as being solutions to their respective equations. A possible problem is that these RWEs can deal with complicated [[mathematical objects]] with exotic algebraic properties (e.g. [[spinors]] are not [[tensors]], so may need calculus over [[spinor field]]s), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate [[Generalization (mathematics)|mathematical generalization]].

==Field theory==
Field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, i.e. a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends.  Usually this is done by writing a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the field, and treating it as a [[classical mechanics|classical]] or [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system with an infinite number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. The resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories.

The dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

It is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from [[multivariable calculus|several variable calculus]], [[potential theory]] and [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs). For example, scalar PDEs might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and [[fluid dynamics]]; temperature/concentration fields  for the [[heat equation|heat]]/[[diffusion equation]]s. Outside of physics proper (e.g., radiometry and computer graphics), there are even [[light fields]]. All these previous examples are [[scalar fields]]. Similarly for vectors, there are vector PDEs for displacement, velocity and vorticity fields in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus over [[vector fields]] (as are these three quantities, and those for vector PDEs in general). More generally problems in [[continuum mechanics]] may involve for example, directional [[elasticity tensor|elasticity]] (from which comes the term ''tensor'', derived from the [[Latin]] word for stretch), [[complex fluid]] flows or [[anisotropic diffusion]], which are framed as matrix-tensor PDEs, and then require matrices or tensor fields, hence [[matrix calculus|matrix]] or [[tensor calculus]]. It should be noted that the scalars (and hence the vectors, matrices and tensors) can be real or complex as both are [[field (algebra)|fields]] in the abstract-algebraic/[[ring theory|ring-theoretic]] sense.

In a general setting, classical fields are described by sections of [[fiber bundle]]s and their dynamics is formulated in the terms of [[jet bundle|jet manifolds]] ([[covariant classical field theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta, G., Mangiarotti, L., [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, G.]] (2009) ''Advanced Classical Field Theory''. Singapore: World Scientific, {{ISBN|978-981-283-895-7}} ([http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0811.0331 arXiv: 0811.0331v2])&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[modern physics]], the most often studied fields are those that model the four [[fundamental forces]] which one day may lead to the [[Unified Field Theory]].

===Symmetries of fields=== &lt;!-- the article [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)]] links here --&gt;
A convenient way of classifying a field (classical or quantum) is by the [[Symmetry in physics|symmetries]] it possesses. Physical symmetries are usually of two types:

====Spacetime symmetries====
{{main|Global symmetry|Spacetime symmetries}}

Fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of [[spacetime]]. The terms used in this classification are:
* [[scalar field]]s (such as [[temperature]]) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. This value does not change under transformations of space.
* [[vector field]]s (such as the magnitude and direction of the [[force (physics)|force]] at each point in a [[magnetic field]]) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. The components of this vector transform between themselves [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariantly]] under rotations in space. Similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly.
* [[tensor field]]s, (such as the [[Stress (physics)|stress tensor]] of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. Under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices.
* [[spinor field]]s (such as the [[Dirac spinor]]) arise in [[quantum field theory]] to describe particles with [[spin (physics)|spin]] which transform like vectors except for the one of their component; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case.

====Internal symmetries====
{{main|Internal symmetry}}
Fields may have internal symmetries in addition to spacetime symmetries. In many situations, one needs fields which are a list of space-time scalars: (φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... φ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;). For example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In [[particle physics]], the [[color charge|color]] symmetry of the interaction of [[quark]]s is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the [[strong interaction]]. Other examples are [[isospin]], [[weak isospin]], [[strangeness]] and any other [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] symmetry.

If there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving spacetime, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an ''internal symmetry''. One may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries.

===Statistical field theory===
{{main|Statistical field theory}}

Statistical field theory attempts to extend the field-theoretic [[paradigm]] toward many-body  systems and [[statistical mechanics]]. As above, it can be approached by the usual infinite number of degrees of freedom argument.

Much like statistical mechanics has some overlap between quantum and classical mechanics, statistical field theory has links to both quantum and classical field theories, especially the former with which it shares many methods. One important example is [[mean field theory]].

===Continuous random fields===
Classical fields as above, such as the [[electromagnetic field]], are usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, [[generalized functions]] are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random fields are used, because [[Thermal fluctuations|thermally fluctuating]] classical fields are [[nowhere differentiable]]. [[Random field]]s are indexed sets of [[random variable]]s; a continuous random field is a random field that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a [[Schwartz space]] of functions as its index set, in which case the continuous random field is a [[Distribution (mathematics)|tempered distribution]].

We can think about a continuous random field, in a (very) rough way, as an ordinary function that is &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere, but such that when we take a [[weighted average]] of all the [[infinity|infinities]] over any finite region, we get a finite result. The infinities are not well-defined; but the finite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the finite values, and that can be well-defined. We can define a continuous random field well enough as a [[linear map]] from a space of functions into the [[real number]]s.

[[File:Sign explaining inclusive language in spanish.jpg|thumb|right|Sign with specific suggestions for gender-neutral language use in Spanish.]]
'''Gender-neutral language''' or '''gender-inclusive language''' is language that avoids bias towards a particular sex or social gender. In English, this includes use of nouns that are not gender-specific to refer to roles or professions, as well as avoidance of the pronouns ''he'', ''him'' and ''his'' to refer to people of unknown or indeterminate gender.&lt;ref name="Fowler 2015 gender-neutral language"&gt;{{Cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Fowler|2015}}|last1=Fowler |first1=H.W.|editor1-last=Butterfield |editor1-first=Jeremy|title= Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the gender of the person referred to is unknown or indeterminate, the [[third-person pronoun]] ''he'' may be avoided by using gender-neutral alternatives – possibilities in English include [[singular they|singular ''they'']], ''he or she'', or ''s/he''.

==Terminology and views==

===General===
Historically, the use of masculine pronouns in place of generic was regarded as non-sexist, but various forms of gender-neutral language became a common feature in written and spoken versions of many languages in the late twentieth century. [[Feminist]]s argue that previously the practice of assigning masculine gender to [[generic antecedents]] stemmed from language reflecting "the prejudices of the society in which it evolved, and English evolved through most of its history in a male-centered, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.stetson.edu/secure/history/hy10302/nongenderlang.html |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |author=Carolyn Jacobson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235019/https://www2.stetson.edu/secure/history/hy10302/nongenderlang.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, feminists [[Casey Miller]] and [[Kate Swift]] created a manual, ''[[The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing]]'', on gender neutral language that was set to reform the existing [[sexist language]] that was said to exclude and dehumanize women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender neutral language - Nonbinary.org|url = http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Gender_neutral_language#cite_note-2|website = nonbinary.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, many feminist efforts were made to reform the [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Use and Evolution of Gender Neutral Language in an Intentional Community|last = Flanagan|first = J.|date = March 1, 2013|journal = Women &amp; Gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become common in some academic and governmental settings to rely on gender-neutral language to convey inclusion of all sexes or genders (gender-inclusive language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gb.uni-koeln.de/gleichstellung_an_der_universitaet/gendersensible_sprache/index_ger.html | title=Leitfaden der Gleichstellungsbeauftragten zur geschlechtersensiblen und inklusiven Sprache | publisher=Gleichstellungsbeauftragte an der Universität zu Köln | date=21 January 2014 | accessdate=9 August 2015 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marquette.edu/wac/neutral/NeutralInclusiveLanguage.shtml | title=Tips for Using Inclusive, Gender Neutral Language | publisher=Marquette University | accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various languages employ different means to achieve gender neutrality:
* [[Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender]]
* [[Gender neutrality in genderless languages]]
* [[Gender neutrality in English]]

Other particular issues are also discussed:
* [[Gender marking in job titles]]
* [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns]]

===Gender indication===
There are different approaches in forming a "gender-neutral language":
* Neutralising any reference to gender or sex, like using "they" as a 3rd person singular pronoun instead of "he" or "she", and proscribing words like ''actress (female actor)'' and prescribing the use of words like ''actor'' for persons of any gender. Although it has long been accepted in the English language, [[Traditional values|traditionalists]] argue that using "they" as a singular pronoun is considered grammatically incorrect, but acceptable in informal writing.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender Neutral Language in Writing|url = http://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/gender-neutral-language.html|website = www.skillsyouneed.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indicating the gender by using wordings like "he or she" and "actors and actresses". However, some forms of indicating gender for gender-neutrality, are labeled gender-binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gjdo.de/%C3%BCber-uns/glossar-zur-gr%C3%BCnen-jugend/ | title=Glossar zur Grünen Jugend | publisher=Grüne Jugend Dortmund | year=2015 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source |reason=The only support this German article gives for this statement is that in the standard -in feminine noun ending in German with the 'I' capitalized to mean both genders (known as [[:de:Binnen-I]] in German, e.g., LehrerIn). This is a highly specialized (and recently coined) method which is not a great example for an English encyclopedia.|date=January 2018}}
* Avoiding the use of "him/her" or the third person singular pronoun "they" by using "the" or restructuring the sentence all together to avoid all three.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

'''General Chinese''' ({{zh|通字}} ''Tung-dzih'') is a [[diaphonemic]] orthography invented by [[Chao Yuen Ren|Yuen Ren Chao]] to represent the pronunciations of all major varieties of Chinese simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Chao (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the most complete genuine Chinese diasystem yet published".&lt;ref&gt;Branner 2006:231.  More recent diaphonemic systems, such as Ao (1991) and Norman (2006), cover a smaller number of morphemes. Norman also excludes Min, though he covers a larger number of non-Min dialects than Chao.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for the [[Hanja|Korean]], [[on'yomi|Japanese]], and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Vietnamese]] [[Sinoxenic|pronunciations of Chinese characters]], and challenges the claim that [[Chinese character]]s are required for interdialectal communication in written Chinese.

General Chinese is not specifically a romanization system, but two alternative systems: one (''Tung-dzih Xonn-dzih'') uses Chinese characters phonetically, as a [[syllabary]] of 2082 glyphs, and the other (''Tung-dzih Lo-maa-dzih'') is an alphabetic romanization system with similar sound values and tone spellings to [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]].

==Character-based General Chinese==

The character version of General Chinese uses distinct characters for any traditional characters that are distinguished [[phoneme|phonemically]] in any of the control varieties of Chinese, which consist of several dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Cantonese language|Yue]]. That is, a single syllabic character will only correspond to more than one logographic character when these are [[homonym]]s in all control dialects. In effect, General Chinese is a syllabic reconstruction of the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]], less distinctions which have been dropped nearly everywhere.

The result is a syllabary of 2082 syllables, about 80% of which are single morphemes—that is, in 80% of cases there is no difference between GC and standard written Chinese, and in running text, that figure rises to 90–95%, as the most common morphemes tend to be uniquely identified. For example, ''kai'' can only mean 開 ''kāi'' 'open', and ''sam'' can only mean 三 ''sān'' 'three'.&lt;ref&gt;Excepting rare, obsolete, or variant characters, such as 叁, the bank variant of ''sān'' 'three'.&lt;/ref&gt; Chao notes, "These syllables then are morphemes, or words with definite meanings, or clusters of meanings related by extensions. About 20 percent of the syllables are homophones under each of which there will be more than one morpheme, [which are traditionally] usually written with different characters [...] The degree of homophony is so low that it will be possible to write text either in literary or colloquial Chinese with the same character for each syllable [...] as has been tested in texts of various styles." Chao compares General Chinese to how Chinese was written when the writing system was still productive: "This amounts to a 100 percent use of writing Chinese by '[[Phonetic loan character|phonetic loan]]' [...] The situation is that when the ancients wrote a character by sound regardless of meaning, it was a 'loan character', whereas if a modern schoolboy writes one, he is punished for writing the wrong character!"&lt;ref&gt;Chao 1976:107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a telegraphic code-book of about 10,000 characters as a representative list of characters in modern use,&lt;ref&gt;Since, as he put it, "most of the additional [characters in a large dictionary] are simply graphical variants or quite obsolete words" (Chao 1976:115).&lt;/ref&gt; Chao notes that General Chinese results in a reduction of 80% in the number of characters needing to be learned.

In the 20% of cases where a syllable corresponded to more than one word, Chao generally selected the graphically most basic traditional character for General Chinese, as long as it wasn't unduly rare. However, when that character had strong semantic connotations that would have interfered with a phonetic reading, he selected a more neutral character. This phenomenon is familiar from [[Transcription into Chinese characters|Chinese transcriptions of foreign names]].

==Romanized General Chinese==

Romanized General Chinese has distinct symbols for the [[Rime table#Initials|onsets]] (many of them [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], and a few trigraphs) and the [[Rime table#Finals|rimes]] distinguished by any of the control dialects. For example, it retains the final consonants ''p, t, k'', and the distinction between final ''m'' and ''n'', as these are found in several modern dialects, such as Cantonese. General Chinese also maintains the "round-sharp" distinction, such as ''sia'' vs. ''hia'', though those are both ''xia'' in Beijing Mandarin. It also indicates the "muddy" (voiced) [[stop consonant|stops]] of [[Shanghainese]]. Indeed, Chao characterized GC as having "the initial consonants of the Wu dialects [...], the vowels of Mandarin, and the endings of Cantonese. It can, however, be pronounced in any dialect, and it is meant to be, by a relatively short list of rules of pronunciation."&lt;ref&gt;Chao 1976:106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chao's other invention, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, romanized General Chinese uses tone spelling. However, the system is somewhat different. The difference between the [[four tones|''yin'' and ''yang'' tones]] is indicated by the [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of the initial [[consonant]], which is possible because the original voicing distinctions are retained. Given that some tones are indicated by changing rather than adding letters, writing tone requires on average only one additional letter for every three syllables of text.

The digraphs are not reliably [[distinctive feature|featural]]; for example, the digraphs for the voiced stops do not all follow the same pattern. This is because Chao ran frequency tests, and used single letters for the most common consonants and [[vowels]], while restricting digraphs and [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraphs]] to the more infrequent ones. Overall, syllables in the texts he transliterated averaged under 3½ letters apiece.

An example of Romanized General Chinese can be illustrated with Chao's name:

All the General Chinese initials here are voiced: The ''h'' in ''dh'' shows that this is a "muddy" consonant, and the ''q'' in ''qiuan'' represents an initial ''ng-'' (becoming ''g'' in Japanese). This voicing shows up in the Cantonese ''yang'' tones, which are represented by aitches in Yale romanization. "Heavy" codas, such as ''remm'', indicate the "departing" (去) tone, as in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Similarly, the spelling ''ao'' in ''dhyao'' indicates the "rising" (上) tone, but because of the voiced initial, it merges with "departing" in Mandarin and literary Cantonese (though not in colloquial Cantonese). The ''y'' in ''dhyao'' indicates that the initial is a stop in Min, Japanese, and Vietnamese, but otherwise an affricate. Cantonese and Korean retain the final ''m'' of ''remm''. These pronunciations are all predictable given the General Chinese transcription, though it was not designed with the Sinospheric languages specifically in mind. Both the pre-war and post-war Japanese orthographies are recoverable.

In every control dialect, some syllables with different spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety will have a pronunciation for a syllable that is not what one would expect from other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.

===Utility of romanized General Chinese vs. traditional characters===

A common argument for retaining Chinese characters is that romanization systems are insufficient to unambiguously represent the Chinese language, due to the large number of homonyms. (However, the Chinese military has found pinyin to be sufficient to telegraph military communications, even without indicating tone.){{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Because General Chinese makes many distinctions that Pinyin does not, it has many fewer homonyms to confuse the reader. Combine this with the fact that many traditional Chinese characters are restricted to specific compounds, and that many homonymic characters distinguish meanings of what are historically the same word, and which are therefore understandable in context, Chao believed that General Chinese begins to approach the effectiveness of traditional characters in representing Chinese.

==Onsets and rhymes==
Character GC has a separate character for each syllable. However, romanized GC has distinct onsets and rhymes. The onsets are as follows:

泥 and 娘 are both transcribed {{angbr|n}}, as these are not distinct in modern dialects. 喻, a conflation of two older initials, 云 ''hy~hw'' and 以 ''y~w'', is transcribed {{angbr|h}} or ∅ according to modern rather than ancient forms; when palatalization is lost, it is transcribed {{angbr|w}}. The palatal and retroflex fricatives 照穿牀審禪 fell together early on in the rime tables of Classical Chinese, but are still distinguished in some modern dialects, and so are distinguished here. The convention {{angbr|q}} for nasal 疑, which drops in many dialects, is repeated in the finals, where it represents {{IPA|*[ŋ]}} with a departing tone.

Although to some extent systematic—the retroflex series are digraphs ending in {{angbr|r}}, for example—this is overridden in many cases by the principle of using short transcriptions for common sounds. Thus {{angbr|z}} is used for 精 rather than for the less common 邪, where it might also be expected; {{angbr|v}} is used for frequent 微 rather than for 奉; and {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|g}}, for the high-frequency 見 and 羣, have the additional benefit of being familiar in their palatalized forms (Peking ~ Beijing for example is -{{angbr|cieng}}) from English words like ''cello'' and ''gem.''

====Dialectal correspondences====
The voiced obstruents (the 濁 "muddy" column) are only distinct in Wu dialects. In Min, they are collapsed with the consonants of the tenuis column. Elsewhere they are generally collapsed with the aspirated column in the even tone, and with the tenuis column in other tones. An exception is Cantonese, where in the rising tone they are aspirated in colloquial speech, but tenuis in reading pronunciations. The sonorants do not vary much apart from {{angbr|v}}, {{angbr|r}}, which in Wu are nasals {{IPA|[m], [ɲ]}} colloquially but fricatives {{IPA|[v], [z]}} when read.

Velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}} are palatalized to affricates before {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|iu}} (the high-front vowels {{IPA|[i], [y]}}) apart from Min and Yue, where they remain stops before all vowels; {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|h}} also palatalize, but remain fricatives. For instance in Mandarin, they are ''g, k, h'' before non-palatalizing vowels and ''j, q, x'' before palatalizing vowels, whereas in Cantonese they remain ''g, k, h'' everywhere. (Compare the alternate spellings of ''Beijing'' and ''Peking''.) The alveolar sibilants {{angbr|z}}, {{angbr|ts}}, {{angbr|dz}}, {{angbr|s}}, {{angbr|sz}} (Mandarin ''z, c, s'') are also generally palatalized before {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|iu}} (to Mandarin ''j, q, x''), collapsing with the palatalized velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|h}} in dialects which have lost the "round-sharp" distinction so important to Peking opera.

The palatal stops {{angbr|dy}}, {{angbr|ty}}, {{angbr|dhy}} remain stops only in Min among the Chinese lects (though also in Japanese and Vietnamese loan words); elsewhere they are conflated with the affricates. The palatal and retroflex sibilants are generally conflated; in Yue and Min, as well as in much of Wu and Mandarin, they are further conflated with the alveolar sibilants. This contrast remains in Beijing, where {{IPA|[sán]}} 'three' is distinct from {{IPA|[ʂán]}} 'mountain'; both are {{IPA|[sán]}} in Sichuanese and Taiwanese Mandarin.

There are numerous more sporadic correlations. For instance, the alveolar affricates {{angbr|z}}, {{angbr|ts}}, {{angbr|dz}} become stops {{IPA|[t], [tʰ]}} in Taishan Yue, whereas the alveolar stops are [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{IPA|[ʔ], [h]}}, as in ''Hoisaan'' for Cantonese ''Toisaan'' (Taishan). In [[Yüchi, Yunnan]], it is the velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}} which are debuccalized, to {{IPA|[ʔ], [ʔʰ]}}. In the Min dialects, {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|fv}} become {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ʍ]}}. In Xi'an Mandarin, the fricatives {{angbr|sh}}, {{angbr|sr}}, {{angbr|zh}}, {{angbr|zr}} are rounded to {{IPA|[f]}} before [[rounded vowel]]s, as in {{IPA|[fêi]}} 'water' (Beijing ''shuǐ'' {{IPA|[ʂwèi]}}).

===Medials===

The categories of the Late Middle Chinese [[rime table]]s are reduced to the four medials of modern Chinese, plus an intermediate type {{angbr|e}}:
{| class=wikitable 
! rowspan="2" |
! rowspan="2" | Division I!!colspan="2" | Division II!!rowspan="2" | Divisions III and IV
|-
! others!! back initials

|- align="center"
! Closed (合)
| colspan="3" | {{tooltip|合|hé}} {{angbr|'''u'''}} || {{tooltip|撮|cuō}} {{angbr|'''iu'''}}
|}
⟨i⟩ and ⟨iu⟩ are omitted after labiodental initials.

====Dialectal correspondences====
The medial {{angbr|e}} is used for syllables which have a palatalizing medial {{IPA|[i]}} in Mandarin, but no medial in Yue. That is, in Mandarin {{angbr|e}} should be read as {{angbr|i}}, with the same effect on consonants as {{angbr|i}} has, whereas in Cantonese it is silent. In Shanghainese both situations occur: {{angbr|e}} is equivalent to {{angbr|i}} in reading pronunciations, as {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[y]}}, but is not found in colloquial speech.

In Cantonese, medial {{angbr|i}} can be ignored after sibilants, as palatalization has been lost in these series. That is, ''siao, shao'' are read the same.

===Rimes===
Chao uses the following rimes. They do not always correspond to the [[Middle Chinese#Finals|Middle Chinese rimes]].

Rimes consist of a nucleus (the main vowel) and optionally a coda. They need to be considered as a unit because of a strong historical interaction between vowel and coda in Chinese dialects. The following combinations occur (note that the vowel {{angbr|iu}} is treated as medial {{angbr|i}} plus nucleus {{angbr|u}}):

{| class=wikitable
! rowspan=2 colspan=2| !!colspan=5|coda
|-

|-
|eng
|-
!i
| || ||im||in||ing
|-
!u
| || || ||un||ung
|}

====Dialectal correspondences====
The most salient dialectal difference in rimes is perhaps the lack of the obstruent codas {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|t}}, {{angbr|c}} in most dialects of Mandarin and independently in the [[Wencheng dialect]] of [[Oujiang Chinese|Oujiang]], though this has traditionally been seen as a loss of ''tone'' (see below). In Wu, Min (generally), New Xiang (Hunanese), Jin, and in the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] and [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]] dialects of Mandarin, these codas conflate to [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. In others, such as Gan, they are reduced to {{IPA|[t], [k]}}, while Yue dialects, Hakka, and Old Xiang maintain the original {{IPA|[p], [t], [k]}} system.

Nasal codas are also reduced in many dialects. Mandarin and Wu do not distinguish between {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}, with them being reduced to {{IPA|[n]}} or nasal vowels, or in some cases dropped altogether. In Shanghainese many instances of {{angbr|nɡ}} have conflated as well, or been dropped, but a phonemic distinction is maintained.

In Mandarin, an additional coda is found, ''-er'' {{IPA|[ɻ]}}, from GC {{angbr|ri}}.&lt;ref&gt;The "[[erhua]]" reported from northern Wu dialects such as [[Hangzhou dialect|Hangzhou]] actually involves suffixing a nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, not {{IPA|[ɻ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cantonese, the simple vowels ''i u iu o a e'' are {{IPA|[iː uː yː ɔː aː ɛː]}}, apart from {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|iu}} after velars, which open to diphthongs, as in ''ci'' {{IPA|[kei]}} and ''ciu'' {{IPA|[kɵy]}}. Diphthongs may vary markedly depending on initial and medial, as in ''cau'' {{IPA|[kou]}}, ''ceau'' {{IPA|[kaːu]}}, ''ciau'' {{IPA|[kiːu]}}, though both ''ceu ~ cieu'' are {{IPA|[kɐu]}}, following the general pattern of {{angbr|e}} before a coda (cf. ''cen'' {{IPA|[kɐn]}} vs ''can'' {{IPA|[kaːn]}}). Cantonese does not have medials, apart from ''gw, kw'', though sometimes it is the nuclear vowel which drops: ''giung'' {{IPA|[kʰoŋ]}}, ''xiong'' {{IPA|[hoŋ]}}, but ''giuan'' {{IPA|[kʰyːn]}}.

=== Combinations of medials and rimes ===

The following combinations of orthographic medials and rimes occur, taking ''-iu'' to be medial ''i'' + rime ''u'' :

{| class=wikitable 
! !!o!!a!!e!!ai!!ei!!i!!u!!au!!eu!!om!!am!!em!!im!!on!!an!!en!!un!!in!!ang*!!aeng!!eng!!ing!!ung!!ong*
|-align=center

|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; In entering tone, ''ang (eang, iang, uang)'' changes to ''oc (eoc, ioc, uoc)'', and ''ong (iong)'' changes to ''ouc (iouc)''
:&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; ''-eaeng'' is generally shortened to ''-aeng''
:&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; In entering tone, ''iuan'' changes to ''iuet''
Double cells show discrepancies between analysis and orthography. For instance, Chao analyzes ''ieng, iueng'' as part of the ''aeng'' series rather than the ''eng'' series, and ''ien'' as part of the ''an'' series.&lt;ref&gt;This corresponds to pinyin, which has ''ian'' for Chao's ''ien'', for example in 天 ''tien'' &amp;rarr; ''tiān''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not apparent from the chart, ''eng-ing-ueng-iuing'', ''ung-ong-iung-iong'', and ''en-in-un-iun'' are similar series. The discrepancies are due to an effort to keep frequent syllables short: ''en-in-un-iun'' rather than ''*en-ien-uen-iuen'', for example; as well as a reflection of some of the more widespread phonological changes in the rimes.

The Classical correspondences, with many archaic distinctions lost, are as follows:

|}
These all occur in the velar-initial series, but not all in the others.

====Dialectal correspondences====

In Cantonese, after coronal stops and sibilants, rounded finals such as ''-on'' and ''-uan'' produce front rounded vowels, as in ''don'' {{IPA|[tyːn]}}, and after velars, ''iung'' and ''iong'' lose their {{angbr|i}}. 
Min dialects are similar, but in certain tones {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|iu}} become diphthongs rather that their usual {{IPA|[i], [y]}}. For example, in Fuzhou, even-tone 星 ''sieng'' is {{IPA|[siŋ]}} but going-tone 性 ''sieq'' is {{IPA|[seiŋ]}}.

In Yunnan Mandarin, {{angbr|iu}} is pronounced as {{angbr|i}}, so that the name of the province, ''yunnom'', is {{IPA|[inna]}} rather than {{IPA|[ynnan]}} as in Beijing.

In Nanking, {{angbr|ien}} [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesizes]] to {{IPA|[ein]}} after alveolars, as in 天 {{IPA|[tʰein]}} for Beijing ''tian'' {{IPA|[tʰiɛn]}}.

===Tones===
The basic spelling is used for the even 平 tone(s). For the rising 上 tone(s), the nucleus is doubled (with the vowel {{angbr|iu}} → {{angbr|iuu}}, as that is treated as medial {{angbr|i}} + nucleus {{angbr|u}}), or the coda is changed to a 'lighter' letter. For the going 去 tone(s), the coda is made 'heavier'; if there is no coda, add {{angbr|h}}. For the entering 入 tone(s), a stop coda is used.

'Lighter' means that a vowel coda is made more [[relative articulation#Lowered|open]] ({{angbr|i}} → {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|u}} → {{angbr|o}}); 'heavier' means that a vowel coda is made more [[relative articulation#Raised|close]] ({{angbr|i}} → {{angbr|y}}, {{angbr|u}} → {{angbr|w}}) and a nasal coda ({{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|m}}) is doubled. The nasal {{angbr|ng}} is 'lightened' to {{angbr|g}} (as in many Polynesian languages) and made heavier as {{angbr|q}} (as in the GC initial):

{| class=wikitable

|}

One consequence of this is that the rimes ''-e'' and ''-ei'' in the even tone conflate to {{angbr|ee}} in the rising tone. However, since there are no such syllables which begin with the same consonant and medial, no syllables are actually conflated.

The difference between ''yin'' and ''yang'' tones is indicated by the voicing of the consonant. A zero consonant is treated as voiceless (it is sometimes reconstructed as a [[glottal stop]]), so ''i, iem, uon, iuan'' are ''ping yin'' (Mandarin ''yī, yān, wān, yuān''), whereas ''yi, yem, won, yuan'' are ''ping yang'' (Mandarin ''yí, yán, wán, yuán''). In a few cases, the effect that voiced {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|r}} have on tone needs to be negated to achieve a ''ping yin'' tone. This is accomplished by spelling them {{angbr|mh}}, {{angbr|nh}}, {{angbr|lh}}, {{angbr|rh}}.

To mark the toneless Mandarin syllable ''ma'', a centered dot is used: {{angbr|·ma}}. The dot is omitted for toneless {{angbr|me, de, te, ne, le}}, as tonic ''me, de, te, ne, le'' do not exist.

====Dialectal correspondences====
The realization of the tones in the various varieties of Chinese is generally predictable; see [[Four tones]] for details. In Beijing Mandarin, for example, even tone is split according to voicing, with muddy consonants becoming aspirates: ''ba, pa, ma, bha'' → ''bā, pā, má, pá'' (and ''mha'' → ''mā''). Going tone is not split, and muddy consonants become tenuis: ''bah, pah, mah, bhah'' → ''bà, pà, mà, bà.'' Rising tone splits, not along voicing, but with muddy-consonant syllables conflating with going tone: ''baa, paa, maa, bhaa'' → ''bǎ, pǎ, mǎ, bà''. That is, ''bhaa'' and ''bhah'' are homonyms in Beijing, as indeed they are in all of Mandarin, in Wu apart from [[Wenzhounese]], in Hakka, and in reading pronunciations of Cantonese. Entering tone is likewise split in Beijing: ''mat, bhat'' → ''mà, bá''.&lt;ref&gt;These series are for illustration; not all of the syllables actually exist.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the realization of entering tones in Beijing dialect, and thus in Standard Chinese, is not predictable when a syllable has a voiceless initial such as ''bat'' or ''pat''. In such cases even syllables with the same GC spelling may have different tones in Beijing, though they remain homonyms in other Mandarin dialects, such as Xian and Sichuanese.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Tianjin dialect]], for example, ''bat, pat, mat, bhat'' &amp;rarr; ''bā, pā, mà, bá''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to historical dialect-mixing in the Chinese capital that resulted in unavoidably idiosyncratic correspondences.

In Yue, there is a straightforward split according to consonant voicing, with a postvocalic {{angbr|h}} in Yale romanization for the latter. Muddy onsets become aspirates in even and rising tones, but tenuis in going and entering tones: ''ba, pa, ma, bha'' → ''bā, pā, māh, pāh''; ''baa, paa, maa, bhaa'' → ''bá, pá, máh, páh''; ''bah, pah, mah, bhah'' → ''ba, pa, mah, bah''; ''bat, pat, mat, bhat'' → ''baat, paat, maht, baht''. In addition, there is a split in entering tone according to vowel length, with Cantonese mid-entering tone for short vowels like ''bāt, pāt''.&lt;ref&gt;This only affects syllables with voiceless initials in Cantonese, but affects all entering-tone syllables in [[Bobai dialect|Bobai]].&lt;/ref&gt; In reading pronunciations, however, rising tone syllables with muddy onsets are treated as going tone: ''bhaa'' → ''bah'' rather than → ''páh''. There is also an unpredictable split in the even ''ping yin'' tone which indicates diminutives or a change in part of speech, but this is not written in all Cantonese romanizations (it is written in Yale, but not in Jyutping).

==Sample text==
Chao provided this poem as an example. The character text is no different in GC and standard Chinese, apart from 裏 ''lǐ'', which in any case has now been substituted with Chao's choice of 里 on the Mainland. Note that simplified characters like this would affect all of Chao's proposal, so that 對 below would become 对, etc. The only other difference is 他 ''tā'' for 'her', which may differ from [[written vernacular Chinese|contemporary written Chinese]] 她, but which follows Classical usage.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liu Bannong]], who invented the character 她.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. This is the bacterium that causes [[cholera]].]]

The '''germ theory of disease''' is the currently accepted [[scientific theory]] of disease. It states that many [[disease]]s are caused by [[microorganism]]s. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a [[bacterium]] but to any type of microorganism, especially one which causes disease, such as [[protists]], [[fungi]], [[viruses]], [[prions]], or [[viroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/germ|title=germ – definition of germ in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms that cause disease are called [[pathogen]]s, and the diseases they cause are called [[infectious disease]]s. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.

The germ theory was proposed by [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in 1546, and expanded upon by [[Marcus von Plenciz]] in 1762. Such views were held in disdain, however, and [[Galen|Galen's]] [[miasma theory]] remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, [[smallpox vaccination]] was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7294/|last1=Henderson|first1=Donald A|last2=Moss|first2=Bernard|title=Smallpox and Vaccinia, Vaccines|year=1999|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| In a 1767 report to the College of Physicians in London, John Zephaniah Holwell mentions the practice of Smallpox vaccinations by Ayurvedic doctors and their explanations of the cause of the disease.|group=N}} A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].  This work was later extended by [[Robert Koch]] in the 1880s. By the end of the 1880s the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a "golden era" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.

== Miasma theory ==
[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]
{{Main article|Miasma theory}}

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century. It held that diseases such as [[cholera]], [[chlamydia infection]], or the [[Black Death]] were caused by a ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]'' (μίασμα, [[Ancient Greek]]: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air" emanating from rotting organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution="miasma theory" |title=A Dictionary of Public Health |editor=John M. Last |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |location=Westminster College, Pennsylvania |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t235.e2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Development ==

=== Pre-19th century ===

In [[Age of the Earth|Antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was the first person to state, in his account of the [[plague of Athens]], that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles and Dorothea (1917) "The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro [1478?–1553] with especial reference to the source, character and influence of his theory of infection," ''Annals of Medical History'', '''1''' :  1–34 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015016778261;view=1up;seq=28 see p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides with Richard Crawley, trans., ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (London, England:  J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1910), Book III, § 51, [https://archive.org/stream/pelocrawleyr00thucuoft#page/130/mode/2up pp. 131–132.]  From pp. 131–132:  " … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection in nursing each other.  This caused the greatest mortality.  On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence."&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by "seeds" (Latin:  ''semina'') that were present in the air.  In his poem, ''De rerum natura'' (On the Nature of Things, ca. 56 BC), the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (ca. 99 BC – ca. 55 BC) stated that the world contained various "seeds", some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or if they contaminated his food.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, Vivian (1983) "The seeds of disease: an explanation of contagion and infection from the Greeks to the Renaissance," ''Medical History'', '''27''' (1) :  1–34 ; see p. 10. Available at:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139262/?page=23 U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius with Rev. John S. Watson, trans., ''On the Nature of Things'' (London, England:  Henry G. Bohn, 1851), Book VI, lines 1093–1130, pp. 291–292 ; [https://archive.org/stream/onnaturethingsd00carugoog#page/n320/mode/2up see especially p. 292.]  From p. 292:  "This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.  Or even, as may be the case, the infection remains suspended in the air itself; and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must necessarily absorb those ''seeds of disease'' into our body."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman statesman [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) wrote, in his ''Rerum rusticarum libri III'' (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): "Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps […] because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, Marcus Terentius with Lloyd Storr-Best, trans., ''Varro On Farming'' (London, England:  G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1912), Book 1, Ch. XII, [https://archive.org/stream/onfarmingmterent00varruoft#page/38/mode/2up/search/diseases p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ca. 200/ca. 216) speculated in his ''On Initial Causes'' (ca. AD 175) that some patients might have "seeds of fever".&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''On the Different Types of Fever'' (ca. AD 175), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by "certain seeds of plague", which were present in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  And in his ''Epidemics'' (ca. AD 176–178), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from a fever because some "seed of the disease" lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients didn't follow a physician's therapeutic regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (ca. AD 613).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1345, [[Tommaso del Garbo]] (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work ''Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni'' (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities (''seminaria morbi'') that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances. The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.

Italian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered by maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]]. Yet [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have done so prior. When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.&lt;ref name=Santer&gt;Melvin Santer, ‘Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century’, in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566-578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific 'animalculae' in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentry), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0028548807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalculae are, and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== Agostino Bassi ===
The Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a "vegetable parasite" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio''{{mdash}}this disease was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The "vegetable parasite" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).

=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===
[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

=== Gideon Mantell ===

[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts On Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps "many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life".&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 90 of "The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too. (Revise date in article to 1846, if so.))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Snow ===
{{Main article|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency,  Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.

{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}

{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}

Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].

In 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].

Later, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur ===
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur’s pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of germ theory of disease.]]
The more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by Louis Pasteur between the year 1860 and 1864. He discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pasteur/louis/exgerm/complete.html |chapter=(translated from French) |trans-chapter=On the extension of the germ theory to the etiology of certain common diseases |first=Louis |last=Pasteur |others=Ernst, H.C. (trans) |year=1880 |origyear=May 1880 |title=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=XC |pages=1033–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood, and suggested using [[boric acid]] to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement.

Pasteur further demonstrated between 1860 and 1864 that [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and the growth of microorganisms in [[nutrient broth]]s did not proceed by spontaneous generation. He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.

Pasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[pébrine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.

=== Robert Koch ===
Robert Koch is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism. These postulates grew out of his seminal work with [[anthrax]] using purified cultures of the pathogen that had been isolated from diseased animals.

Koch's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker L, Levine H, Jucker M | title = Koch's postulates and infectious proteins | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16703338 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-006-0072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Koch's time, it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates.&lt;ref name=Koch1884 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"/&gt; Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock TD]] |year=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–95 |date=May 1976 |pmid=782050 |pmc=2595276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacomo V, Kelly P, Raoult D |title=Natural history of ''Bartonella'' infections (an exception to Koch's postulate) |journal=Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11777823 |doi=10.1128/CDLI.9.1.8-18.2002 |pmc=119901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while Koch's postulates retain historical importance and continue to inform the approach to microbiologic diagnosis, fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality.

Koch's postulates have also influenced scientists who examine microbial pathogenesis from a molecular point of view. In the 1980s, a [[molecular Koch's postulates|molecular version]] of Koch's postulates was developed to guide the identification of microbial genes encoding [[virulence]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falkow S |title=Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S274–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3055197 |doi=10.1093/cid/10.Supplement_2.S274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koch's postulates:'''
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch Robert |title=Über den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |year=1893 |volume=14 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.1007/BF02284324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.

The third postulate specifies "should", not "must", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,&lt;ref name=Koch1884&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884 |title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte |chapter=Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |volume=2 |pages=1–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also: Conferenz zur Erörterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt [Conference to discuss the matter of cholera at the Imperial Health Office]. ''Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift'' 10 (1884), pages 499-507, 519-532 --&gt; not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Noninfection may be due to such factors as general health and proper immune functioning; acquired immunity from previous exposure or vaccination; or genetic immunity, as with the resistance to malaria conferred by possessing at least one sickle cell allele.

The second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture, such as prions responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419–22 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a body of evidence that satisfies Koch's postulates is sufficient but not necessary to establish causation.

== Sanitation ==
In the 1870s, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was instrumental in developing practical applications of the germ theory of disease with respect to sanitation in medical settings and aseptic surgical techniques—partly through the use of carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) as an antiseptic.

'''Gestalt psychology''' or '''gestaltism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɔː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɔː|l|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gestalt "gestalt"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Gestalt}} {{IPA-de|ɡəˈʃtalt|}} "shape, form") is a philosophy of mind of the [[Berlin School of experimental psychology]]. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a [[holism|global whole]] with self-organizing tendencies.

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist [[Kurt Koffka]], "the whole is ''something else'' than the sum of its parts"&lt;ref&gt;Koffka 1935, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; is often incorrectly translated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck|first=Michael|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/gestalt-principles-applied-in-design/|title=Gestalt Principles Applied in Design |date=Aug 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The whole is ''greater'' than the sum of its parts", and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to [[systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hothersall: ''History of Psychology'', chapter seven, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Koffka did not like the translation. He firmly corrected students who replaced "other" with "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he said.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, F. 1977. Cited in Dewey, R.A. 2007. [http://www.intropsych.com/ch04_senses/whole_is_other_than_the_sum_of_the_parts.html Psychology: An introduction: Chapter four - The Whole is Other than the Sum of the Parts]. Retrieved 4/12/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole has an independent existence.

In the study of [[perception]], Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the [[behaviorist]] approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the ''organization'' of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]]. Gestalt theory, it is proposed, allows for the deconstruction of the whole situation into its elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = G | year = 1924 | title = The psychology of the gestalt | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 401–412 | doi = 10.1037/h0070207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of gestalt was first introduced in philosophy and psychology in 1890 by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (a member of the [[School of Brentano]]). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Max Wertheimer]]'s unique contribution was to insist that the "gestalt" is perceptually primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier ''Gestalt-Qualität'' had been.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively. On the philosophical foundations of these ideas see Foundations of Gestalt Theory (Smith, ed., 1988).

Early 20th century theorists, such as [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] (students of [[Carl Stumpf]]) saw objects as perceived within an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of [[perception]]—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure or ground]]. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive,&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl/&gt; it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects (Carlson et al. 2000), and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

===Gestalt therapy===
The founders of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893–1933. Expressionism – Psychonalysis – Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term "Gestalt" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm "Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.

Mary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.&lt;ref&gt;See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe, e.g. [[Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy]].

==Theoretical framework and methodology==
The school of gestalt practiced a series of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The theoretical principles are the following:
* '''Principle of Totality'''—The conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships.
* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' – A [[correlation]] exists between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.

Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.
* '''Biotic experiment'''—The school of gestalt established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonné Cohen – World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic : papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from cybernetics and neurology==
In the 1940s and 1950s, [[laboratory]] research in [[neurology]] and what became known as [[cybernetics]] on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that [[perception]] of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts ''in motion'') is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, "fixes" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image "marks time" in the vicinity of this point.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Fedorovich Turchin – The phenomenon of science – a cybernetic approach to human evolution – Columbia University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52051454|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar,|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52051454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
This is demonstrated by the ''dog picture'', which depicts a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] dog sniffing the ground in the shade of overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts.  Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.

{{clear left}}

===Reification===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] --&gt;
{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}

[[Image:Reification.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]

Reification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.

For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as "real" contours.

{{clear left}}

===Multistability===
[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]

[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.

{{clear left}}

===Invariance===
[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]

Invariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

Emergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prägnanz''==
{{Main|Principles of grouping}}

The fundamental principle of gestalt [[perception]] is the law of ''{{ill|prägnanz|de|Prägnanz|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in the German language, ''pithiness''), which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.  Gestalt [[psychologist]]s attempt to discover refinements of the law of ''prägnanz'', and this involves writing down [[laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called "gestalt laws".&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]© 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]
[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]
[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]
[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb]]
A major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.  The various laws are called ''laws'' or ''principles'', depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term ''laws''. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman – GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].

# '''Law of Proximity'''—The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure that illustrates the Law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups.  Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soegaard&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Similarity'''—The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Closure'''—The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Symmetry'''—The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Common Fate'''—The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.&lt;ref name=todorvic&gt;{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles |website=Scholarpedia.org |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Continuity'''—The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;
# '''Law of Good Gestalt'''—The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the '''law of Prägnanz'''.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;  Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean "pithiness" and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;
# '''Law of Past Experience'''—The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters "L" and "I" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016&gt;{{citation| author=Jäkel, F., Singh, M., Wichmann, F. A., &amp; Herzog, M. H. | year=2016 | title=An overview of quantitative approaches in Gestalt perception. | journal=Vision Research | volume=126 | pages=3–8 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2016.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many [[Physiology|physiological]] assumptions made by gestaltists&lt;ref name=Schultz2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultz | first = Duane | title = A History of Modern Psychology | publisher = Elsevier Science | location = Burlington | year = 2013 | page = 291 | isbn = 1483270084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016/&gt;

In some scholarly communities, such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[computational neuroscience]], gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being ''descriptive'' rather than ''explanatory'' in nature.  For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, [[Vicki Bruce|Bruce]], Green &amp; Georgeson&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce, V., Green, P. &amp; Georgeson, M. |title=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology |publisher=LEA |year=1996 | edition=3rd |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude the following regarding gestalt theory's influence on the study of visual perception:
{{quote|text=The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their "laws" of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a "good" or "simple" shape, for example? | author=Bruce, Green &amp; Georgeson | source=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology}}

==Gestalt views in psychology==
Gestalt psychologists find it is important to think of problems as a whole. Max Wertheimer considered thinking to happen in two ways: productive and reproductive.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych2"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Fourth Edition, Thomas Wadsworth© 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Productive thinking''' is solving a problem with insight.

This is a quick insightful unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction.

'''Reproductive thinking''' is solving a problem with previous experiences and what is already known.  (1945/1959).

This is a very common thinking. For example, when a person is given several segments of information, he/she '''deliberately''' examines the relationships among its parts, analyzes their purpose, concept, and totality, he/she reaches the "aha!" moment, using what is already known. Understanding in this case happens '''intentionally''' by reproductive thinking.

Another gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:
# Unconscious leap in thinking.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"/&gt;
# The increased amount of speed in mental processing.
# The amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.&lt;ref name="gpsych"&gt;Langley&amp; associates, 1987; Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 1986,1995"&lt;/ref&gt;

Views going against the gestalt psychology are:
# [[Insight phenomenology|Nothing-special view]]
# Neo-gestalt view
# [[The Three-Process View]]

Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal= Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems |year=2014|pages=163–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in design==
The gestalt laws are used in [[user interface design]]. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing [[radio button]]s. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard |first=Mads |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html |title=Gestalt principles of form perception |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum cognition modeling==
{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}

Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that "similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment. ''Synthese'', October 1993, Volume 97, Issue 1, pp 125–156; Das Gestaltproblem in der Chemie: Die Entstehung molekularer Form unter dem Einfluß der Umgebung, ''Gestalt Theory, 1992, 14(4), 228-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of [[Association (psychology)|cognitive associations]] with mathematical tools borrowed from [[quantum mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = Elio | last2 = Todarello | first2 = Orlando | last3 = Federici | first3 = Antonio | last4 = Vitiello | first4 = Francesco | last5 = Lopane | first5 = Michele | last6 = Khrennikov | first6 = Andrei | last7 = Zbilut | first7 = Joseph P. | year = 2007 | title = Some remarks on an experiment suggesting quantum-like behavior of cognitive entities and formulation of an abstract quantum mechanical formalism to describe cognitive entity and its dynamics | url = | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1076–1088 | doi = 10.1016/j.chaos.2005.09.061 |arxiv=0710.5092 | bibcode = 2007CSF....31.1076C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elio Conte, Orlando Todarello, Antonio Federici, Francesco Vitiello, Michele Lopane, Andrei Khrennikov: A Preliminary Evidence of Quantum Like Behavior in Measurements of Mental States, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201 arXiv:quant-ph/0307201] (submitted 28 July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and has discussed psychology experiments in this context. A similar approach has been suggested by physicists [[David Bohm]], [[Basil Hiley]] and philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]] with the notion that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both emerge from [[Implicate and explicate order#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J. Hiley: ''Particles, fields, and observers'', Volume I The Origins of Life, Part 1 Origin and Evolution of Life, Section II The Physical and Chemical Basis of Life, pp. 87–106 ([http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/Frontiersoflife.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil J. Hiley, Paavo Pylkkänen: ''Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework''. In Paavo Pylkkänen and Tere Vadén (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, {{ISBN|90-272-5157-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CCX1NhhpQNQC&amp;pg=PA119 pages 119-144]&lt;/ref&gt; The models involve non-[[commutative property|commutative]] mathematics; such models account for situations in which the outcome of two measurements performed one after the other can depend on the order in which they are performed—a pertinent feature for psychological processes, as an experiment performed on a conscious person may influence the outcome of a subsequent experiment by changing the state of mind of that person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2931">'''Graphesthesia''' is the ability to recognize writing on the skin purely by the sensation of [[touch]]. Its name derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''graphē'' ("writing") and ''aisthēsis'' ("perception").  Graphesthesia tests combined cortical sensation; therefore, it is necessary that primary sensation be intact.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;Blumenfeld, H. (2010). 'Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases' (2nd Edition ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

During medical or [[neurological examination]] graphesthesia is tested in order to test for certain neurological conditions such as; [[lesions]] in [[brainstem]], [[spinal cord]], [[sensory cortex]] or [[thalamus]].  An examiner writes single numbers or simple letters on the skin (usually the palm) with something that will provide a clear stimulus, such as a broken tongue depressor, pen cap etc.   Prior to the start of testing, an agreement may be reached between the examiner and the patient as to the orientation of the letters, although this is often unnecessary, since orientation and size of the figures are rarely an issue. The crucial aspect of testing graphesthesia, as with any sensory testing, is to establish that the patient understands the test, hence the test is commenced, in the hemiplegic patient, on the normal, intact hand. This also allows the examiner to establish the patient's numeracy, since semi-numerate patients may have difficulties performing the task.

The patient provides a verbal response identifying the figure that was drawn.  If the patient has a speech or language impairment that prevents them from verbalizing an answer, the answer can be selected from a series of images shown to them.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;O'Sullivan, S. B., &amp; Schmitz, T. J. (2007). 'Physical Rehabilitation' (5th Edition ed.). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Loss of graphesthesia indicates either parietal lobe damage on the side opposite the hand tested or damage to the [[Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway|dorsal columns pathway]] at any point between the tested point and the contralateral parietal lobe. 
The major clinical utility of the test in the 21st century is in the condition, cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration, where, in addition to evidence of basal ganglia dysfunction, the presence of cortical sensory loss is likely to have reasonably high specificity for the diagnosis.

Testing graphesthesia can be substituted for [[stereognosis]] if a patient is unable to grasp an object.&lt;ref name="OS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48454">A '''hub-and-spoke conspiracy''' (or '''hub-and-spokes conspiracy''') is a legal construct or doctrine of United States antitrust and criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. use of the doctrine can be traced to an origin in the 1930s or 1940s. See ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States'', 306 U.S. 208 (1939); ''Kotteakos v. United States'', 328 U.S. 750 (1946). But since 2000 European cartel authorities have begun to use the concept. See, e.g.,  [http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/Jdg_CoA_1014Argos_Little_JJB191006.pdf ''JJB Sports PLC v Office of Fair Trading''], [2006] EWCA Civ 1318(UK Ct App 2003).&lt;br&gt;See also {{cite AustLII|FCA|1813|1996|litigants=News Ltd v Australian Rugby League Ltd (No 2) |parallelcite=(1996) 64 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 410 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a conspiracy, several parties ("spokes") enter into an unlawful agreement with a leading party ("hub"). The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy," a central mastermind, or "hub," controls numerous "spokes," or secondary co-conspirators. These co-conspirators participate in independent transactions with the individual or group of individuals at the "hub" that collectively further a single, illegal enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Newton'', 326 F.3d 253, 255 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such a conspiracy involves a hub, generally the dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market, and the spokes, made up of the distributors involved in the conspiracy. The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors (distributors) that form the spokes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1921/howard-hess-dental-v-dentsply-intern/ ''Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int’l, Inc.'', 602 F.3d 237, 255 (3d Cir. 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The antitrust cases often emphasize the importance of interdependence among the spokes and their recognition of one another. The general criminal cases, such as narcotics conspiracy prosecutions, tend to require only a more general knowledge among the spokes that there is a larger overall unlawful scheme involving other actors who are cooperating with the hub in carrying out the scheme. It is controversial, particularly in the antitrust cases, how much knowledge spoke actors must have of the conduct of other spoke actors—which is to say how much of a "rim" must be put around the "wheel" of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy for it to be a single conspiracy rather than many separate "vertical" conspiracies. There is a controversy and some uncertainty over the legal status of the "rimless" conspiracy—one with very limited interaction among the spokes.

==History==

The leading two Supreme Court cases were ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States''], 306 U.S. 208 (1939); [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''], 328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Circuit===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''[[Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States]]''],&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 208 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; the Government sued two groups of defendants for engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy. One group of eight defendants were distributors (such as Paramount Pictures) of motion picture films, that distributed about 75 percent of all first-class feature films exhibited in the United States.. A second group of defendants were two dominant theater owners in Texas and New Mexico—Interstate Circuit and a related company—which had a monopoly of first-run theaters in various cities.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 214-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
The manager of the defendant theater owners sent a same or similar letter to each of the distributor defendants, naming on its face as addressees all of the defendant distributors. The letter demanded as a condition of continued dealing that the distributor (1) require that second-run theaters never exhibit the films at a smaller admission price than 25¢, and (2) never exhibit them in conjunction with another feature picture (so-called double features). Conferences discussing the matter were held between representatives of Interstate and individual distributors. The distributors each agreed and complied with the demands.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held it permissible to draw "the inference of agreement from the nature of the proposals made .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.[and] from the substantial unanimity of action taken upon them by the distributors." The Court emphasized that each distributor knew that the distributors all knew that the others were getting the same letter and knew that "without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory, there was risk of a substantial loss of the business and goodwill of the subsequent-run and independent exhibitors, but that, with it, there was the prospect of increased profits." The Court said that provided "strong motive for concerted action."&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it. Each distributor was advised that the others were asked to participate; each knew that cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Acceptance by competitors, without previous agreement, of an invitation to participate in a plan the necessary consequence of which, if carried out, is restraint of interstate commerce is sufficient to establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kotteakos===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''],&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Brown, owner of a construction company, conspired with Kotteakos and 31 other persons to defraud the Government by filing false statements in applications for loans for modernization and renovation under the National Housing Act. No connections was shown between the individual loan applicants. In each case, however, Brown induced the applicants to file the loan application and assisted them in applying, in return for a 5% commission.

The Court characterized the facts as showing: "As the Government puts it, the pattern was 'that of separate spokes meeting at a common center,' though we may add without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The Court therefore held that while the indictment alleged one conspiracy the Government proved several (at least eight) conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. at 755.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Government failed to demonstrate the rim of the wheel, that connected the spokes to one another. "Without the rim, an alleged hub-and-spoke cartel is merely a set of vertical relationships (or restraints) that result in parallel conduct and does not establish" a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent Supreme Court hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases==

Since ''Interstate Circuit'', the Supreme Court decided four hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases and one case rejecting a parallel-action conspiracy claim.

===Masonite===

''[[United States v. Masonite Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. 265 (1942),&lt;/ref&gt; was a patent–antitrust price-fixing case, in which the patent holder negotiated licenses with price-fixing clauses while resolving infringement disputes with some of the licensees. The Supreme Court said that each licensee “acted independently of the others, negotiated only with [the patent holder], desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance . . . an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others."&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Court applied ''Interstate Circuit'' because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not clear at what precise point of time each [defendant licensee] became aware of the fact that its contract was not an isolated transaction but part of a larger arrangement. But it [was] clear that as the arrangement continued each became familiar with its purpose and scope.”&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, even if the evidentiary requirements of ''Interstate Circuit'' were not met at the outset of the cartel arrangement, they were met after it remained in place. "It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it."

===Blumenthal===

In ''Blumenthal v. United States'', the Supreme Court looked at the other side of the coin of ''Kotteakos''. The Court distinguished the ''Kotteakos'' case involving several conspiracies from the case before it involving one conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In ''Kotteakos''] no two of those agreements were tied together as stages in the formation of a larger all-inclusive combination, all directed to achieving a single unlawful end or result. On the contrary each separate agreement had its own distinct, illegal end. Each loan was an end in itself, separate from all others, although all were alike in having similar illegal objects. Except for Brown, the common figure, no conspirator was interested in whether any loan except his own went through. And none aided in any way, by agreement or otherwise, in procuring another's loan. The conspiracies therefore were distinct and disconnected, not parts of a larger general scheme, both in the phase of agreement with Brown and also in the absence of any aid given to others as well as in specific object and result. There was no drawing of all together in a single, over-all, comprehensive plan. Here the contrary is true. All knew of and joined in the overriding scheme.&lt;ref&gt;''Blumenthal v. United States'', 332 U.S. 539, 558 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theater Enterprises===

In ''Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/537/case.html 346 U.S. 537] (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court rejected a claim by a suburban theater owner (TEI) that a group of motion picture producers and distributors had violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to restrict first-run films to downtown Baltimore theaters, thus confining petitioner's suburban theater to subsequent runs and unreasonable "clearances." Each of the defendant motion picture producers and distributors refused to make first-run films available to TEI and adhered to an established policy of restricting first-runs in Baltimore to the eight downtown theaters. There was no direct evidence of illegal agreement among the defendants. The "crucial question" was whether the defendants' conduct against TEI "stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express." The lower court, in effect, refused to direct the jury to find a conspiracy based on the facts as to parallel refusals to deal with TEI. The Supreme Court said that was correct, because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense. Circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy, but "conscious parallelism" has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.&lt;ref&gt;346 U.S. at 541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Klor's===

In ''[[Klor’s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/359/207/case.html 359 U.S. 207] (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; a major California department store, Broadway-Hale, induced  Admiral, Emerson Radio, General Electric, Philco, RCA, Whirlpool, Zenith, and other major appliance manufacturers to stop selling to Klor's, a price cutter in San Francisco. Klor's brought an antitrust treble damages suit, alleging a conspiracy among Broadway-Hale and the manufacturers. By pre-trial order the case one was limited to a single conspiracy charging a Sherman Act violation. The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the lower courts agreed, on the grounds that Klor's was only one of many stores selling such goods, so that its elimination as a competitive factor did not substantially lessen competition in the general market—there was no public injury. Whether a conspiracy existed was by-passed, even though the allegations appear to have described a rimless wheel conspiracy, without the spokes (appliance manufacturers) being connected to one another, knowing what one another were doing, or being interdependent. The Supreme Court reversed, on the grounds that Klor's sufficiently pleaded a boycott conspiracy. The Court said, "Alleged in this complaint is a wide combination consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and a retailer."&lt;ref&gt;359 U.S. at 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parke, Davis===

In ''[[United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. 29 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held it proper to infer a combination among a drug manufacturer, wholesalers, and retailers when the manufacturer engaged in a substantial course of concerted activities in order to stop discounters from selling its products below recommended resale prices. The manufacturer 
informed its wholesalers that it would terminate any wholesaler that sold its products to discounters, and enforced this policy. It discussed the policy with its wholesalers and retailers to secure adherence to it, and it put together an agreement among retailers not to advertise products at prices below those recommended. Parke Davis offered the retailers its products "packaged in a competition-free wrapping .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. by virtue of concerted action induced by the manufacturer." Parke Davis was "thus the organizer of a price maintenance combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."

===General Motors===

In ''United States v. General Motors Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/127/case.html 384 U.S. 127] (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Chevrolet car dealers in the Los Angeles area persuaded GM to eliminate price cutters. In response to dealers' complaints organized by their trade associations, GM Los Angeles area officials treated the "principal offenders" to "unprecedented individual confrontations" and obtained promises to abandon the practices deemed objectionable. Most agreed promptly but one put off decision for a week "to make sure that the other dealers, or most of them, had stopped their business dealings with discount houses." A "joint effort between General Motors, the three [local dealer] associations, and a number of individual dealers" was organized to police compliance. GM local officials confronted reoffenders and required them to repurchase cars sold in violation of policy. "[T]he campaign to eliminate the discounters from commerce in new Chevrolet cars was a success."

The district court refused to find a Sherman Act violation. But the Supreme Court reversed. It explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dealers collaborated, through the associations and otherwise, among themselves and with General Motors, both to enlist the aid of General Motors and to enforce dealers' promises to forsake the discounters. The associations explicitly entered into a joint venture to assist General Motors in policing the dealers' promises, and their joint proffer of aid was accepted and utilized by General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;384 at U.S. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only did the dealers conspire among themselves but they enlisted GM to act as the "hub" of the conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Parke Davis had done, General Motors sought to elicit from all the dealers agreements, substantially interrelated and interdependent, that none of them would do business with the discounters. These agreements were hammered out in meetings between nonconforming dealers and officials of General Motors' Chevrolet Division, and in telephone conversations with other dealers. It was acknowledged from the beginning that substantial unanimity would be essential if the agreements were to be forthcoming. And once the agreements were secured, General Motors both solicited and employed the assistance of its alleged co-conspirators in helping to police them. What resulted was a fabric interwoven by many strands of joint action to eliminate the discounters from participation in the market, to inhibit the free choice of franchised dealers to select their own methods of trade, and to provide multilateral surveillance and enforcement. This process for achieving and enforcing the desired objective can by no stretch of the imagination be described as "unilateral" or merely "parallel."&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 144-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conduct was illegal ''per se''. "Exclusion of traders from the market by means of combination or conspiracy is so inconsistent with the free market principles embodied in the Sherman Act that it is not to be saved by reference to the need for preserving the collaborators' profit margins or their system for distributing automobiles, any more than by reference to the allegedly tortious conduct against which a combination or conspiracy may be directed.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was price fxing.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent lower court cases==

The various courts of appeals have interpreted and modified the Supreme Court's rulings on hub-and-spoke conspiracies.

===Drug cases===

====Poliafico====

One of the cases that the Supreme Court relied on in ''Blumenthal'' was ''Poliafico''. In ''Poliafico v. United States'', the Sixth Circuit found a conspiracy to sell heroin among several suppliers in bulk and their retail supplier agents (street dealers) who retailed it to addicts in diluted form and in smaller quantities. The Sixth Circuit explained the structure of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of the appellants were either selling heroin to Poliafico and his associates, or reselling it for them, or carrying on negotiations for such sales, or making payments therefor, or delivering heroin for resale, or reselling it. The purchase of heroin and the resale of heroin, in this case, was concerned with one enterprise, which could be called the Poliafico deal, in the parlance of the underworld. The over-all conspiracy was the plan, conceived by Poliafico and his associates, to buy and sell heroin at a profit. The [retail] suppliers knew that the purchases were for resale and they also knew that several conspirators were involved in the purchases.&lt;ref&gt;''Poliafico v. United States'', 237 F.2d 97, 103 (6th Cir. 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court said, "The fact that one such [retail] supplier did not have dealings with another [retail] supplier does not matter," because if "each performs the same role at successive stages for the same ends, and both know and participate in the plan of the others to buy and sell heroin at a profit, each is guilty as a conspirator."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 103-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The court explained its concept of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When two or more persons are shown to have been engaged in the same unlawful conspiracy, having for its object the same common and unlawful purpose, it is not necessary to prove the knowledge by one of the dealings, or even of the existence, of the others, in order to render evidence of the actions of those others admissible against that person. There was one conspiracy in this case — the continuing scheme of buying and reselling heroin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; 
The proofs of the government show that all appellants were associated in this scheme, some by virtue of selling or delivering the heroin to the Poliafico group, others because of being associated with the group in carrying out the scheme, collecting money through resales of the drug, making payments to suppliers, or carrying on negotiations for the purchase or resale. All appellants knew of the conspiracy. The suppliers knew that the Poliafico group must resell the heroin at a profit; and all associated with Poliafico in the resale of the heroin knew that Poliafico must buy it from suppliers and that the resales must be at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not necessary for each conspirator to know the whole scope or all the details of the conspiracy. "He must know the [unlawful] purpose of the conspiracy, however, otherwise he is not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tramaglino====

Other narcotics conspiracy cases are similar. For example, in ''United States v. Tramaglino'',&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; a distinguished panel of the Second Circuit (Swan, A. Hand, and Frank) found a single conspiracy to buy and resell marijuana based on "evidence of several sales, at different periods, by Rosario and Tramaglino, of marihuana to the same group of buyers with knowledge on the part of the two suppliers that several conspirators were involved in the purchases and that the purchases were for resale." The court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was enough, we think, to show that each appellant, as supplier, participated in, and acted to further the ends of, the conspiracy. It did not matter that neither had dealings with one another; each performed the same role at successive stages for the same ends. The overall conspiracy was the plan conceived by the intermediary group — Alvarez, Zayas, and their fellows — to buy and resell marihuana at a profit. Both Rosario and Tramaglino knew and participated in this plan by furnishing the essential ingredient — the marihuana.&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d at 930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Chain conspiracy====

A closely related concept to the hub-and-spoke conspiracy, or a variation on it, is the chain conspiracy, which is linear rather than wheel-shaped. A representative example is ''United States v. Bruno''. In ''Bruno'' 88 people were alleged to be members of a single conspiracy to import, sell and possess narcotics. The evidence was that over a substantial period of time a conspiracy existed embracing a great number of persons. The object of the conspiracy was to smuggle narcotics into New York and distribute them to addicts both in New York and in Texas and Louisiana. "This required the cooperation of four groups of persons: the smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the smugglers and distributed to retailers; and two groups of retailers — one in New York and one in Texas and Louisiana — who supplied the addicts."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Bruno'', 105 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1939) (L. Hand, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants argued that there were at least three separate conspiracies: one between the smugglers and the middlemen, one in New York between the New York middlemen and group of retailers. and one in Texas and Louisiana between those middlemen and retailers. Since the evidence did not disclose any cooperation or communication between the smugglers and either group of retailers, or between the two groups of retailers themselves. However, insisted the court:

[[File:Twisted link chain.jpg|thumb|right|100px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The smugglers knew that the middlemen must sell to retailers, and the retailers knew that the middlemen must buy of importers of one sort or another. Thus the conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the unlawful business would not, and could not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew that it had not begun with their sellers. That being true, a jury might have found that all the accused were embarked upon a [single] venture, in all parts of which each was a participant, and an abettor in the sense that the success of that part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There could also be two conspiracies—one in New York including the smugglers, the New York middlemen and the New York group of retailers; and the other including the smugglers, the Gulf Coast middlemen and the Gulf Coast group of retailers. There was apparently no contact between the two groups of retailers, possibly negating their being in a conspiracy together. "That too would be fallacious," the court said, because there was only one conspiracy as far as the defendant smugglers were concerned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was of no moment to them whether the middlemen sold to one or more groups of retailers, provided they had a market somewhere. So too of any retailer; he knew that he was a necessary link in a scheme of distribution, and the others, whom he knew to be convenient to its execution, were as much parts of a single undertaking or enterprise as two salesmen in the same shop. We think therefore that there was only one conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To sustain a chain conspiracy charge, the evidence must establish "that each conspirator had the specific intent to further the common unlawful objective."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Tarantino'', 846 F.2d 1384, 1392 (D.C. Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; It is immaterial that the individual co-conspirators do not know each other or meet. "Courts have long recognized that participants in a continuous drug distribution enterprise can be parties to a single conspiracy even if they do not all know one another, so long as each knows that his own role in the distribution of drugs and the benefits he derives from his participation depend on the activities of the others."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Childress'', 58 F.3d 693, 709-10 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder-Beerman===

In ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.'', the plaintiff retailer E–B claimed that the defendant Federated department store chain conspired with 66 (later 12) suppliers in violation of the antitrust laws. E–B argued that Federated (and/or its predecessor Rike's) and the suppliers conspired to destroy E–B's ability to compete on fair terms, and for the purpose of attempting to obtain a department store monopoly in the Dayton, Ohio area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5983967853810117033&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.''], 459 F. 2d 138, 139–40 (6th Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth Circuit characterized E–B's legal theory as the "rimless wheel" theory. E–B contended that it had established a conspiracy by showing the following: Rike's used "coercion" to persuade some suppliers to grant Rike's the exclusive right to sell the merchandise involved; other suppliers granted exclusives to Rike's although E–B lacked evidence that Rike's had in fact used coercion to persuade them to do so; there was evidence of an exclusive relationship between Rike's and many of the suppliers; there was evidence of an exclusive arrangement resulting from "coercion" as to some of the suppliers; for the other suppliers, the basic evidence was they refused to sell to E–B; there was also evidence that Rike's refused to buy from certain suppliers who sold to E–B.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court relied on ''Poliafico'' to find a single conspiracy. The Sixth Circuit said that in that case "by the very nature of the business everyone involved in the alleged conspiracy had to know that other persons would be performing illegal acts in furtherance of the conspiracy." It therefore appears that to establish a conspiracy under the rimless wheel theory, it must be shown:
:(1) that there is an overall-unlawful plan or "common design" in existence; 
:(2) that knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required, and 
:(3) there must be a showing of each alleged member's participation.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since there was no evidence for each supplier that the supplier in fact had knowledge of the existence of such conspiracy, such a supplier could not be considered a spoke. "We, therefore, hold that on this record Elder-Beerman failed to offer sufficient probative evidence to establish the alleged single conspiracy upon which it bases its claim for damages." &lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

One judge dissented as to the conspiracy issue. He stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Elder-Beerman's theory, Rike's was the hub of the conspiratorial wheel and its exclusive suppliers were the spokes. One of the important questions in this case is whether the suppliers (or any of them) agreed with each other, as well as with Rike's, to participate in the conspiracy. My colleagues believe, and I believe, that there was no such evidence in this record. In short, there was no rim to this wheel, or to put it in more conventional antitrust language, there was no proof of a horizontal conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he considered it proper to find a single conspiracy as in ''Poliafico''. He found ''Kotteakos'' inapplicable because that was a ruling to protect the spokes from being tarred with one another's conduct after the hub had pleaded guilty. Here, in contrast, the supplier spokes are not in court, "and the case proceeds against the central party charged with the conspiracy, the hub of this particular wheel." Any error is harmless, he said, and the case is more like ''Klor's'' than like ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys "R" Us===

The ''Toys "R" Us'' chain of retail toy stores, the largest such U.S. chain (selling approximately 20% of all the toys sold in the United States), found itself encountering severe competition from price-cutting warehouse clubs. It became concerned that warehouse clubs—with substantially lower prices—presented a threat to its low-price image and its profits. The FTC determined that to eliminate this threat, Toys "R" Us used its dominant position as a toy distributor to extract parallel agreements from among ten principal toy manufacturers (such as Mattel, Hasbro, Fisher Price, Tyco, and Sega) to stop selling to warehouse clubs exactly the same toys that they sold to other toy distributors such as the clubs. The FTC explained that Toys "R" Us wanted "to prevent consumers from comparing the price and quality of products in the clubs to the price and quality of the same toys displayed and sold at Toys "R" Us, and thereby to reduce the effectiveness of the clubs as competitors."

The FTC found that Toys "R" Us also used the acquiescence of one manufacturer to obtain that of others, orchestrating a horizontal agreement among at least seven manufacturers to adhere to Toys "R" Us’s restrictions. The company also used the manufacturers to police one another. When one manufacturer complained that a competitor was selling to warehouse clubs, Toys "R" Us threatened to stop buying that competitor’s products and got its renewed acquiescence to the sales restrictions. The FTC found that the effect of the agreements was to eliminate competition that would have driven Toys "R" Us to lower its prices had Toys "R" Us not taken action to stifle the competitive threat posed by the clubs. The FTC concluded that "Toys "R" Us and its reluctant collaborators set out to eliminate from the marketplace a form of price competition and a style of service that increasing numbers of consumers preferred," and that Toys "R" Us’ had orchestrated a boycott that harmed the clubs, competition, and consumers without any "business justification for a boycott that had [such] a pronounced anticompetitive effect."&lt;ref&gt;''Toys “R” Us, Inc.'', 126 F.T.C. 415, 574–75 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, the FTC emphasized that "key toy manufacturers were unwilling to refuse to sell to or discriminate against the clubs unless they were assured that their competitors would do the same,” and that Toy "R" Us "acted as the central player in the middle of what might be called a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, shuttling commitments back and forth between toy manufacturers and helping to hammer out points of shared understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;126 F.T.C. at 574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, comparing the case to ''Interstate Circuit''. The court emphasized FTC findings supporting a hub-and-spoke theory. For example, a Toys "R" Us official testified, "We made a point to tell each of the vendors that we spoke to that we would be talking to our other key suppliers." Mattel and Hasbro executives testified that they went along with "the special warehouse club policy (or, in the Commission's more pejorative language, boycott)" only "because our competitors had agreed" to it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11480829751523506812&amp;q=221+F.3d+928&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Toys “R” Us, Inc. v. FTC''], 221 F.3d 928, 932–33 (7th Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that "there must be some evidence that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently," but rejected the idea that "the Commission had to exclude all possibility that the manufacturers acted independently." But the FTC relied on evidence even more compelling than that in ''Interstate Circuit'' because it included direct communications and interdependence—the manufacturers testified that "the only condition on which each toy manufacturer would agree to [the boycott] demands was if it could be sure its competitors were doing the same thing." And "as is classically true in such cartels," the court said, "they were willing to do so only if TRU could protect them against cheaters."&lt;ref&gt;221 F.3d at 934-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dickson v. Microsoft===

In ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.'', the plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that Microsoft had engaged in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy with three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)—Compaq, Dell, and PB Electronics—to restrain trade, in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, in the sale of operating systems, word processing, and spreadsheet software, and also a conspiracy to maintain Microsoft's alleged monopolies in the same  markets, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. The alleged conspiracy was a set of similar licensing agreements in which the licensees agreed: (1) not to remove icons, folders, or Start menu entries from the Windows desktop; (2) not to modify the initial Windows boot sequence; (3) to integrate Microsoft's Internet browser software Internet Explorer (IE) and other application software with Microsoft's operating system software; and (4) to long-term distribution contracts, exclusive dealing distribution arrangements, and per-processor license fees. In exchange, the OEM defendants received various benefits, including discounts on software and "greater cooperation from Microsoft in product development." The OEMs also gained various competitive advantages in selling computer hardware. The district court held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and dismissed the case. An appeal to the Fourth Circuit followed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6381104972216483819&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.''], 309 F.3d 193, 198–200 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Circuit said that the allegations described a "rimless wheel" conspiracy or a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. Citing ''Kotteakos'', the court stated, "A rimless wheel conspiracy is one in which various defendants enter into separate agreements with a common defendant, but where the defendants have no connection with one another, other than the common defendant's involvement in each transaction." That is a hub-and-spoke conspiracy "without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The court added, "In ''Kotteakos'', the Supreme Court made clear that a rimless wheel conspiracy is not a single, general conspiracy but instead amounts to multiple conspiracies between the common defendant and each of the other defendants." Thus, the hub-and-spoke conspiracy claim failed. The claim of separate vertical conspiracies, however, potentially survived a motion to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 203-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Circuit dismissed the complaint, however, on other grounds, including insufficient likelihood of substantial anticompetitive effects.

A dissenting judge distinguished ''Kotteakos'' from this case and would have found a sufficient allegation of a conspiracy. The missing element in ''Kotteakos'' was interdependence; each of the other defendants used Brown's services independently of every other defendant's use. The rimless conspiracy pleaded here had as its elements: (1) an overall unlawful plan; (2) knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member, because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy, but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required; and (3) each alleged co-conspirator participated in some way. The dissent argued that the allegations were that "each OEM joined a conspiracy which it knew was, by its nature, broader than just itself and Microsoft." The dissent said this satisfied the Supreme Court's language on hub-and-spoke conspiracy in ''Interstate Circuit'' ("[I]t is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators") and ''Masonite'' ("Here, as in ''Interstate Circuit'', .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [i]t was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it.").&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 216-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PepsiCo v. Coca-Cola===

In ''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', the Second Circuit rejected PepsiCo's claim that it had shown a hub-and-spoke conspiracy that Coca-Cola put together with independent food service distributors ("IFDs"), prohibiting the IFDs from delivering PepsiCo products to any of their customers. Coca-Cola had a "loyalty program" that provided that IFDs who supply customers with Coca-Cola may not "handle [&amp;#8239;] the soft drink products" of PepsiCo, under penalty of termination. PepsiCo had sued Coca-Cola, charging that the enforcement of the program violated Sherman Act § 1's per se rule against boycotts, but the court granted summary judgment because it found that PepsiCo failed to prove a horizontal agreement among IFDs to boycott PepsiCo. PepsiCo offered no evidence of direct communications among the IFDs; it offered only to prove that Coca-Cola assured the IFDs that the loyalty policy would be uniformly enforced and encouraged them to report violations. The Second Circuit said, "We agree with the district court that this was insufficient evidence of a horizontal agreement to withstand summary judgment."&lt;ref&gt;''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3157695759800147418&amp;q=315+F.3d+101&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 315 F.3d 101, 109–11 (2d Cir. 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt;

PepsiCo argued that it had shown a per se illegal hub-and-spoke conspiracy. But the Second Circuit said the cases on which PepsiCo relied were price-fixing hub-and-spoke cases, such as ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Parke, Davis'', which were based on ''per se'' illegal conduct. But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not ''per se'' illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot ''per se'' illegal. To be ''per se'' illegal as a boycott, the IFDs must agree together not to deal with PepsiCo. "A horizontal agreement is a prerequisite in a group boycott case."&lt;ref&gt;315 F.3d at 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not say so, the court apparently thought PepsiCo had shown merely a rimless wheel.

===Apple (eBook Case)===

In ''United States v. Apple, Inc.'' (the ''eBook'' case), Apple decided to enter the electronic book business, which was dominated by Amazon, which sold about 90% of the ebooks of the six major U.S. publishers. Apple persuaded five of these Big 6 publishers to enter into agency distribution agreements with it as principal and them as agent. The agreements set prices, and the publishers raised their prices. Apple had established a cartel for the publishers. The district court found a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy and the Second Circuit affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Apple Inc.'', 952 F. Supp. 2d 638, 694–695 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff'd, 791 F.3d 290, 313–14 (2d Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Apple unsuccessfully argued that the ''per se'' rule should not apply to a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy because it was "vertical."

===Guitar Center===

In the ''Guitar Center'' case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FCO%2020150825175/IN%20RE%20MUSICAL%20INSTRUMENTS%20&amp;%20EQUIP.%20ANTITRUST%20LITIGATION ''In re Musical Instruments and Equip. Antitrust Litig. (Guitar Center)''], 798 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Ninth Circuit considered an alleged hub-and-spoke conspiracy case similar to ''Klor's'' and ''Interstate Circuit'', but the court (2-1) found it implausible that the spokes conspired rather than merely acting independently in a parallel fashion. Guitar Center, the largest retail seller of musical instruments in the United States, accounted for about a third of all U.S. retail sales of guitars and guitar amplifiers. It was alleged that Guitar Center, a trade association of music retailers, and the five major manufacturers of guitars and guitar amplifiers conspired to set minimum prices at which any retailer could advertise the manufacturers' guitars and guitar amplifiers, in violation of the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d 1189-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court dismissed the federal antitrust claim on the pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Nat'l Ass'n of Music Merchs., No. MDL No. 2121, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118827 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the court conceded that "the line between horizontal and vertical restraints can blur," and a "conspiracy can involve both direct competitors and actors up and down the supply chain, and hence consist of both horizontal and vertical agreements," as in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192.&lt;/ref&gt; The court saw the key question before it as "whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to provide a plausible basis from which we can infer the alleged [manufacturers' horizontal] agreements' existence.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court noted "one key difference between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical agreements joined by horizontal agreements)." The key difference was that "courts analyze vertical agreements under the rule of reason, whereas horizontal agreements are violations per se." The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plaintiffs relied on proof of the manufacturers' parallel conduct (they adopted the minimum price policy at about the same time) together with some so-called plus factors. The claim that the manufacturers' conduct was interdependent—that is, it would succeed only if they all did the same thing as appropriate united front—was not enough, the court said, because "companies base their actions in part on the anticipated reactions of their competitors. And because of this mutual awareness, two firms may arrive at identical decisions independently, as they are cognizant of—and reacting to—similar market pressures."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of plus factors is therefore critical. The court listed the plaintiffs' alleged plus factors—"economic actions and outcomes that are largely inconsistent with unilateral conduct but largely consistent with explicitly coordinated action"—that could make the manufacturers' parallel action appear to be the result of agreement, but dismissed each as insufficiently persuasive:
* defendants shared a common motive to conspire, but the court said that interdependent firms may engage in consciously parallel conduct through observation of their competitors' decisions, even absent an agreement;
* the manufacturers acted against their individual self-interest, but the court said that a firm can risk being the first to raise prices, confident that if its price is followed, all firms will benefit, and if they don’t follow the leader the firm can always drop the price back to avoid loss of market share; furthermore, that the manufacturers all responded to Guitar Center's pressure, heeding similar demands made by a common, important customer, does not suggest ''horizontal'' conspiracy or collusion, just self-interested independent parallel conduct in an interdependent market;
* the manufacturers simultaneously adopted substantially similar price policies, but the court said that simultaneity does not reveal anything more than similar reaction to similar pressures within an interdependent market;
* the FTC investigated the trade association defendant for the same practices, sued it, and the association accepted a consent decree, but the court said that did not prove a conspiracy occurred;
* the defendant manufacturers participated in the trade association's meetings urging adoption of the challenged pricing policy, but the court said listening to advocacy does not show an agreement; and 
* retail prices for guitars and guitar amplifiers rose during the class period as the number of units sold fell, but the court said a price increase is no more suggestive of collusion than it is of any other potential cause.
In the Ninth Circuit's view, all this showed was that "Guitar Center used its substantial market power to pressure each manufacturer to adopt similar policies, and each manufacturer adopted those policies as in its own interest."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1195-98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One judge dissented. He pointed out that "although the majority opinion purports to address the six plus factors as a whole, it actually focuses on each factor individually." In his view, "When truly analyzed together, the six plus factors strongly suggest that the manufacturer defendants reached an illegal horizontal agreement, which 'nudge' plaintiffs' allegations 'from conceivable to  plausible.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

● Professor Orbach asserts that in the ''Guitar Center'' case "the Ninth Circuit made the error of trying to break the alleged conspiracy 'into its constituent parts, the respective vertical and horizontal agreements.'&amp;#8239;" Since this was a dismissal on the pleadings, the court's analysis "demand[s] that plaintiffs offer at the pleading stage evidence of direct horizontal coordination," which is a heavy burden. The result is that the court provides "a free pass to hub-and-spoke conspiracies where vertical communications may have dispensed with the need for such horizontal coordination."&lt;ref&gt; Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} 1, 11 (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

He is perhaps best known for his theories on [[communicative rationality]] and the [[public sphere]]. In 2014, ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' readers chose Habermas as one of their favourites among the "world's leading thinkers".&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/world-thinkers-2014-the-results|title=World thinkers 2014: The results|author=Serena Kutchinsky|date=23 April 2014|publisher=Prospect Magazine |quote=12. Jürgen Habermas, philosopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], Habermas's work focuses on the foundations of [[epistemology]] and [[social theory]], the analysis of [[advanced capitalism]] and [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] in a critical [[Sociocultural evolution|social-evolutionary context]], and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of [[modernity]], particularly with respect to the discussions of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] originally set forth by [[Max Weber]]. He has been influenced by [[American pragmatism]], [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]], and even [[poststructuralism]].

==Biography==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Habermas was born in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Rhine Province]], in 1929. He was born with a [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] and had corrective surgery twice during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1451092|title=Disabling Democracy: How Disability Reconfigures Deliberative Democratic Norms|first1=Clifford|last1=Simplican|first2=|last2=Stacy|date=28 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen. 2008. Between Naturalism and Religion: Philosophical Essays. (First chapter).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by World War II. Until his graduation from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], Habermas lived in [[Gummersbach]], near [[Cologne]]. His father, Ernst Habermas, was Executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer. He was brought up in a staunchly Protestant milieu, his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1949/50), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1950/51), and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between the absolute and history in Schelling's thought, entitled, ''{{lang|de|Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken}}'' ("The Absolute and History: On the Schism in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling's]] Thought"). His dissertation committee included [[Erich Rothacker]] and [[Oskar Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Das_Absolute_und_die_Geschichte.html?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte: von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken|first=Jurgen|last=Habermas |date=1954|publisher=Gummers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Social Research]], but because of a rift between the two over his [[dissertation]]—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the [[Frankfurt School]] had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture&lt;ref name=cjc352&gt;Craig J. Calhoun, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 352. {{ISBN|0-631-21350-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—he finished his ''[[habilitation]]'' in [[political science]] at the [[University of Marburg]] under the Marxist [[Wolfgang Abendroth]]. His ''habilitation'' work was entitled ''{{lang|de|Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit; Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Bürgerlichen Gesellschaft}}'' (published in English translation in 1989 as ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society''). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In 1961 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of "extraordinary professor" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (at the instigation of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Karl Löwith]]) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher [[Albrecht Wellmer]] was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.

He accepted the position of Director of the [[Max Planck Institute#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in [[Starnberg]] (near [[Munich]]) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780&amp;ndash;2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}}, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of "Permanent Visiting" Professor at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois, and "[[Theodor Heuss]] Professor" at [[The New School]], [[New York City|New York]].

Habermas was awarded The [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf Public space and political public sphere] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204151440/http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf |date=2012-02-04 }} (pp. 2&amp;ndash;4).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy|Arts and Philosophy]] section. He traveled to [[San Diego]] and on 5 March 2005, as part of the [[University of San Diego]]'s [[Kyoto Symposium]], gave a speech entitled ''The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context'', regarding the evolution of [[separation of church and state]] from neutrality to intense [[secularism]]. He received the 2005 [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the [[humanities]] (including the [[social science]]s) by ''[[The Times Higher Education Guide]]'', ahead of Max Weber and behind [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas is the father of [[Rebekka Habermas]], historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the [[University of Göttingen]].

===Teacher and mentor===
Habermas is a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist [[Claus Offe]] (professor at the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at [[La Trobe University]] and chief editor of the journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]''), the social philosopher Hans-Herbert Kögler (Chair of Philosophy at [[University of North Florida]]), the sociological theorist [[Hans Joas]] (professor at the [[University of Erfurt]] and at the [[University of Chicago]]), the theorist of societal [[evolution]] Klaus Eder, the social philosopher [[Axel Honneth]] (the current director of the Institute for Social Research), the political theorist David Rasmussen  (professor at [[Boston College]] and chief editor of the journal "[[Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism]]"), the environmental ethicist [[Konrad Ott]], the anarcho-capitalist philosopher [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;), the American philosopher [[Thomas A. McCarthy|Thomas McCarthy]], the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research [[Jeremy J. Shapiro]], and the assassinated Serbian prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].

==Philosophy and sociology==
Habermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1981), ''Kleine Politische Schrifen I-IV'', pp. 500f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[German philosophy|German philosophical thought]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]
* the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] tradition—both the theory of [[Karl Marx]] himself as well as the critical [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], i.e. [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;
* the sociological theories of [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[George Herbert Mead]]
* the [[linguistic philosophy]] and [[speech act]] theories of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[John Searle]]
* the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]
* the American pragmatist tradition of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Dewey]]
* the sociological [[social system|social systems theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]
* [[Neo-Kantian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Doohm, Stefan. Jürgen Habermas. Frankfurt, Suhrkamp, 2008 (Suhrkamp BasisBiographie, 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the [[rationalism|rationalist tradition]], by locating [[rationality]] in structures of interpersonal linguistic [[communication]] rather than in the structure of the [[cosmos]]. This social theory advances the goals of [[human emancipation]], while maintaining an inclusive [[universalist]] [[morality|moral]] framework. This framework rests on the argument called [[universal pragmatics]]—that all [[speech acts]] have an inherent [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "purpose")—the goal of mutual [[understanding]], and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the [[speech-act]] philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]], the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of [[George Herbert Mead]], the [[moral development|theories of moral development]] of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], and the [[discourse ethics]] of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student [[Karl-Otto Apel]].

Habermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and [[the Enlightenment]] and of [[democratic socialism]] through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an "unfinished project," he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded.&lt;ref name=cjc351&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of [[postmodernist]] thought, for excessive pessimism, [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], and exaggerations.&lt;ref name=cjc351/&gt;

Within sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of [[societal evolution]] and [[modernization]] focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and [[strategic rationality|strategic]] / [[instrumental rationality]] and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based [[theory]] of [[social system]]s developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]], a student of [[Talcott Parsons]].

His defence of modernity and [[civil society]] has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of [[late capitalism]].

Habermas perceives the rationalization, [[humanism|humanization]] and [[democratization]] of society in terms of the [[institutionalization]] of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the [[communicative competence]] that is unique to the [[human species]]. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the [[Market (economics)|market]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[organization]]s, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the [[lifeworld]].

===Reconstructive science===
Habermas introduces the concept of "reconstructive science" with a double purpose: to place the "general theory of society" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the "great theorization" and the "empirical research".
The model of "[[rational reconstruction]]s" represents the main thread of the surveys about the "structures" of the world of life ("culture", "society" and "personality") and their respective "functions" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between "symbolic representation" of "the structures subordinated to all worlds of
life" ("internal relationships") and the "material reproduction" of the social systems in their complex ("external relationships" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.

This model finds an application, above all, in the "theory of the social evolution", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of the socio-cultural life forms (the "hominization") until an analysis of the development of "social formations", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.
"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of "reconstruction of the logic of development" of "social formations" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the "rationalization of the world of life" and the "growth in complexity of the social systems"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the "explanation of the dynamics" of "historical processes" and, in particular, about the "theoretical meaning" of the evolutional theory's propositions.  Even if the German sociologist considers that the "ex-post rational reconstructions" and "the models system/environment" cannot have a complete "historiographical application", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the "historical explanation"".&lt;ref name="Corchia"&gt;{{citation | first = Luca | last = Corchia | chapter = Explicative models of complexity.

===The public sphere===
{{details|public sphere}}
In ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]],'' Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a "representational" culture, where one party sought to "represent" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects.&lt;ref name=Blanning26&gt;Blanning, T. C. W. ''The French Revolution Class War or Culture Clash?'', New York: St. Martin's Press (1987), 2nd edition 1998, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "representational" culture, Habermas argued that [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles]] was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace.&lt;ref name=Blanning26 /&gt; Habermas identifies "representational" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of ''Öffentlichkeit'' (the public sphere).&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27"&gt;Blanning (1998), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the culture characterized by ''Öffentlichkeit'', there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27"&gt;Blanning (1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Habermas's view, the growth in [[newspaper]]s, [[Literary magazine|journals]], reading clubs, [[Masonic lodge]]s, and [[coffeehouses]] in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of "representational" culture with ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was its "critical" nature.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Unlike "representational" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; In his view, the [[French Revolution]] was in large part caused by the collapse of "representational" culture, and its replacement by ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Though Habermas' main concern in ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27" /&gt;

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[mass media]], which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the "public sphere" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded [[rational consensus]].

His most known work to date, the ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]'' (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons [[AGIL Paradigm]]. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization.&lt;ref name=cjc353&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the [[welfare state]], [[corporate capitalism]] and [[mass consumption]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; These reinforcing trends rationalize public life.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and [[representative democracy]] replaces [[participatory democracy|participatory one]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the [[Social system|system]] and the lifeworld are deteriorating.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc354&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; An "[[ideal speech situation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy, Power and Legitimacy: The Critical Theory of Jürgen Habermas |last=Payrow Shabani |first=Omid A. |year=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 0-8020-8761-2 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0802087612&amp;id=tKDU3l3cq60C&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors.&lt;ref name=cjc354/&gt; In this version of the [[consensus theory of truth]] Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.

Habermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere.&lt;ref name=cjc355&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant [[nation-state]] is replaced by a [[deliberative democracy]]-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc355/&gt; In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance and as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the [[decision-making process]].

==== Criticism ====
Several noted academics have provided various criticisms of Habermas's notions regarding the public sphere. [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John B. Thompson]], a Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of ''The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge,'' also known as [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|title=Jesus College website|author=|date=|website=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601125221/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|archivedate=1 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has claimed that Habermas's notion of the public sphere is antiquated due to the proliferation of mass-media communications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Michael Schudson]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]] argues more generally that a public sphere as a place of purely rational independent [[debate]] never existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Nancy Fraser]], the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/?id=4e54-6b31-4d41-3d3d|title=Departments - The New School for Social Research (NSSR)|author=|date=|website=www.newschool.edu|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a noted feminist critic of Habermas' work on the public sphere, arguing for the existence of multiple spheres and counterpublics.

==Habermas versus postmodernists==
Habermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, "Modernity versus Postmodernity" (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we "should try to hold on to the ''intentions of the Enlightenment'', feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?"&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Sociological Theory'', ''From Modern to Postmodern Social Theory (and Beyond)'', McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, New York, 2008, pp. 567&amp;ndash;568.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, "scientific" understanding of the life-world.

Habermas has several main criticisms of [[postmodernism]]:

# The postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;
# Habermas feels that the postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;
# Habermas accuses postmodernism of a totalizing perspective that fails "to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society";&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"/&gt;
# Habermas asserts that postmodernists ignore that which Habermas finds absolutely central – namely, everyday life and its practices.

==Key dialogues==

===''Historikerstreit'' (Historians' Quarrel)===
{{Main|Historikerstreit}}
Habermas is famous as a [[public intellectual]] as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the [[popular press]] to attack the German historians [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]]. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 11 July 1986 in a ''[[feuilleton]]'' (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled "A Kind of Settlement of Damages". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for "apologistic" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to "close Germany's opening to the West" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, "A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing", pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In the Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas argued that Ernst Nolte, Michael Stürmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from the mainstream of [[German history]], explain away Nazism as a reaction to [[Bolshevism]], and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army) during [[World War II]]. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a "vicarious religion" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a "kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hillgruber's statement that Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews "because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his ''Reich''", Habermas wrote: "Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 37&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas wrote: "The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about "the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe" (Stürmer) and "the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''Historikerstreit'' ("Historians' Quarrel") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like [[Joachim Fest]],&lt;ref&gt;Fest, Joachim, "Encumbered Remembrance: The Controversy about the Incomparability of National-Socialist Mass Crimes", pp. 63&amp;ndash;71 &amp; "Postscript, April 21, 1987", pp. 264&amp;ndash;265 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

Piper (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as [[Martin Broszat]],&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin, "Where the Roads Part: History Is Not A Suitable Substitute for a Religion of Nationalism", pp. 123&amp;ndash;129, ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

===Habermas and Derrida===
Habermas and [[Jacques Derrida]] engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"&gt;{{Citation |last=Derrida |first=J |author-link=Jacques Derrida |title=Honesty of Thought |work=The Derrida-Habermas Reader |editor=Lasse Thomassen |place=Chicago Ill |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |year=2006 |page=302 |isbn=9780226796833}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published "Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen, L. "Introduction: Between Deconstruction and Rational Reconstruction" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 1&amp;ndash;7. P.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, "those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me".&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J., "Is There a Philosophical Language?" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 35&amp;ndash;45. P.37.&lt;/ref&gt; After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy "conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly".&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt;

At the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt; In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled "How to answer the ethical question?" at the ''Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida'' conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).

In the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the September 11 attacks]], Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the [[War on Terror]] in [[Giovanna Borradori]]'s ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida''. In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming [[Iraq War]]; in a manifesto that later became the book ''[[Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe]]'', the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the [[European Union]] in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 ("February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe") in the book, which was a reaction to the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. and Derrida, J. "February 15, Or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, beginning in the Core of Europe" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 270&amp;ndash;277. P. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview.

=== Religious dialogue ===
Habermas' attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas' attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an "alienating reality" and "control tool"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st Century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas has recognized the positive social role of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, Rosalía. 2011. ''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/10/07/cultura/1317980044.html 'San' Jürgen Habermas]''. [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:

{{quote|For the normative self-understanding of modernity, [[Christianity]] has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic [[egalitarianism]], from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance. Everything else is idle postmodern talk.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen, ''Religion and Rationality: Essays on Reason, God, and Modernity'', ed. Eduardo Mendieta, MIT Press, 2002, p. 149. And Habermas, Jurgen, ''Time of Transitions'', Polity Press, 2006, pp. 150&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1342&amp;theme=home&amp;page=4&amp;loc=b&amp;type=ctbf ''First Principles Journal&amp;ndash; Recovering the Western Soul'', Wilfred M.

The original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is, 

{{quote|''as Christentum ist für das normative Selbstverständnis der Moderne nicht nur eine Vorläufergestalt oder ein Katalysator gewesen. Der egalitäre Universalismus, aus dem die Ideen von Freiheit und solidarischem Zusammenleben, von autonomer Lebensführung und Emanzipation, von individueller Gewissensmoral, Menschenrechten und Demokratie entsprungen sind, ist unmittelbar ein Erbe der jüdischen Gerechtigkeits- und der christlichen Liebesethik. In der Substanz unverändert, ist dieses Erbe immer wieder kritisch angeeignet und neu interpretiert worden. Dazu gibt es bis heute keine Alternative. Auch angesichts der aktuellen Herausforderungen einer postnationalen Konstellation zehren wir nach wie vor von dieser Substanz. Alles andere ist postmodernes Gerede.''|From Jürgen Habermas - "Zeit der Übergänge" (Suhrkamp Verlag, 2001) p.&amp;nbsp;174f.}}

This statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Ih-Ren Mong. ''Dialogue Derailed: Joseph Ratzinger's War against Pluralist Theology''. Wipf and Stock Publishers. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion'' (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: [[secular]] people need to [[tolerate]] the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329090452/http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php |date=2009-03-29 }} by Jurgen Habermas, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Javier |last=Espinosa. |url=http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf |title=The religion in the public sphere.

In early 2007, [[Ignatius Press]] published a dialogue between Habermas and the then [[Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Holy Office]] [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005), entitled ''[[The Dialectics of Secularization]]''. The dialogue took place on January 14, 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the [[Catholic Academy of Bavaria]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERzoAPsS9usC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=uxJYtSd7Bi&amp;dq=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;f=false|title=Dialectics of Secularization: On Reason and Religion|first1=Benedikt XVI|last1=(Papst)|first2=Jürgen|last2=Habermas|date=28 October 2017|publisher=Ignatius Press|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It addressed contemporary questions such as:
* Is a public culture of [[reason]] and ordered [[liberty]] possible in our [[Post-metaphysical philosophy|post-metaphysical]] age?
* Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in [[being]] and [[anthropology]]?
* Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for [[religion]] itself?

In this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a "methodological atheist," which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified [[Liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, ''"to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly [[illiberal democracy|illiberal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Rodney. 2014. ''[http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/12/tis_the_season_to_reveal_what_atheists_really_want.html#ixzz3OPTyHKel Tis the Season to Reveal What Atheists Really Want]''. AmericanThinker. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, in the first period of his career, he began as a skeptic of any social usefulness of religion, he now believes there is a social role and utilitarian [[moral]] strength in religion, and notably, that there is a necessity of [[Judeochristian]] ethics in culture.&lt;ref&gt;ForumLibertas.com. 2006. ''[http://www.forumlibertas.com/frontend/forumlibertas/noticia.php?id_noticia=6908 Jürgen Habermas, pensador icono de la izquierda, reivindica el valor de la religión]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of "[[Postsecularism|post-secular]]" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014.

Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist dialogue===
Habermas has sided with other 20th century commentators on Marx such as [[Hannah Arendt]] who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action|Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason]]''. As Habermas states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... traditional Marxist analysis ... today, when we use the means of the critique of political economy ... can no longer make clear predictions: for that, one would still have to assume the autonomy of a self-reproducing economic system. I do not believe in such an autonomy. Precisely for this reason, the laws governing the economic system are no longer identical to the ones Marx analyzed. Of course, this does not mean that it would be wrong to analyze the mechanism which drives the economic system; but in order for the orthodox version of such an analysis to be valid, the influence of the political system would have to be ignored.&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4023">A '''line of flight''' ({{lang-fr|ligne de fuite}}) is a concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and used extensively in his work with [[Félix Guattari]]. Translator [[Brian Massumi]] notes that in French, "''Fuite'' covers not only the act of fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, and disappearing into the distance (the [[vanishing point]] in a painting is a ''point de fuite'').  It has no relation to flying."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Notes on the Translation and Acknowledgments" to Deleuze and Guattari (1980, xvi)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first chapter of the second volume of their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' project, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), the concept is used to define a "[[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Multiplicity (philosophy)|Multiplicities]] are defined by the outside: by the abstract line, the line of flight or [[deterritorialization]] according to which they change in nature and connect with other multiplicities. The plane of consistency (grid) is the outside of all multiplicities. The line of flight marks: the reality of a finite number of dimensions that the multiplicity effectively fills; the impossibility of a supplementary dimension, unless the multiplicity is transformed by the line of flight; the possibility and necessity of flattening all of the multiplicities on a single plane of consistency or exteriority, regardless of their number of dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 9-10).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Manuel De Landa]]'s book ''[[Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy]]'', the line of flight is described as an operator which transcends the actual and ascends to the virtual. It is used as a synonym with Deleuze's terms "dark precursor" (from his ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968)), "[[desiring machine]]" and "quasi-cause" (both from the first volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]'' (1972)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42851">'''Lip reading''', also known as lipreading or '''speechreading''', is a technique of understanding [[speech]] by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue when normal sound is not available. It relies also on information provided by the context, knowledge of the language, and any residual hearing. Although ostensibly used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = L | last2 = Hickson | first2 = L | last3 = Dodd | first3 = B | year = 2009 | title = Review of visual speech perception by hearing and hearing-impaired people: clinical implications | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 253–70 | doi = 10.1080/13682820802090281 | pmid = 18821117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

Although [[speech perception]] is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make  movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5808871 | volume=12 | title=Interaction of audition and vision in the recognition of oral speech stimuli | year=1969 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=423–5 | last1 = Erber | first1 = NP | doi=10.1044/jshr.1202.423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see [[McGurk effect]]).  The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.

===Phonemes and visemes===
The [[phoneme]] is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - [[viseme]]s - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. These include [[glottal consonants]] and most gestures of the tongue. [[Voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for [[nasalisation]] (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophene Homophenes] are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of  [[Bad Lip Reading|mis-lip reading]].

[[File:  Sam Loyd lipreading puzzle.jpg|thumb| The legend to this puzzle reads "Here is a class of a dozen boys, who, being called up to give their names were photographed by the instantaneous process just as each one was commencing to pronounce his own name. The twelve names were Oom, Alden, Eastman, Alfred, Arthur, Luke, Fletcher, Matthew, Theodore, Richard, Shirmer, and Hisswald. Now it would not seem possible to be able to give the correct name to each of the twelve boys, but if you practice the list over to each one, you will find it not a difficult task to locate the proper name for every one of the boys."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Loyd|Sam Loyd's]] Cyclopedia of Puzzles, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

===[[Co-articulation]]===
Visemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be ‘shaped’ by an adjacent phoneme:  the ‘th’ sound in ‘tooth’ and in ‘teeth’ appears very different because of the [[vowel|vocalic]] context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading 'beyond the viseme'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7162162 | volume=25 | title=Coarticulation effects in lipreading | year=1982 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=600–7 | last1 = Benguerel | first1 = AP | last2 = Pichora-Fuller | first2 = MK | doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===How can it 'work' with so few visemes?===
The statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other ('lexical neighbors', such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are 'unique' in terms of the distribution of their phonemes ('umbrella' may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly 'fit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | year = 2010 | title = Investigating speechreading and deafness | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 163–8 | doi = 10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 | pmid = 20211120 | pmc = 3715375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = TR | last2 = Thomas | first2 = SM | year = 2011 | title = When half a face is as good as a whole: effects of simple substantial occlusion on visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 73 | issue = 7| pages = 2270–85 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-011-0152-4 | pmid = 21842332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Head movement that accompanies normal speech can also improve lip-reading, independently of oral actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = SM | last2 = Jordan | first2 = TR | year = 2004 | title = Contributions of oral and extraoral facial movement to visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 873–88 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.30.5.873 | pmid = 15462626 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when lip-reading [[connected speech]], the viewer's knowledge of the spoken language, familiarity with the speaker and style of speech, and the context of the lip-read material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spehar | first1 = B | last2 = Goebel | first2 = S | last3 = Tye-Murray | first3 = N | year = 2015 | title = Effects of Context Type on Lipreading and Listening Performance and Implications for Sentence Processing | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 1093–102 | doi = 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-H-14-0360 | pmid = 25863923 | pmc=4610295}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as important as the visibility of the speaker. While most hearing people are sensitive to seen speech, there is great variability in individual speechreading skill. Good lipreaders are often more accurate than poor lipreaders at identifying phonemes from visual speech.

A simple visemic measure of 'lipreadability'  has been questioned by some researchers. The 'phoneme equivalence class' measure takes into account the statistical structure of the lexicon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Files | first1 = BT | last2 = Tjan | first2 = BS | last3 = Jiang | first3 = J | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = LE | year = 2015 | title = Visual speech discrimination and identification of natural and synthetic consonant stimuli | url = | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 878 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00878 | pmid = 26217249 | pmc=4499841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also accommodate individual differences in lip-reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9407662 | volume=102 | title=Speechreading and the structure of the lexicon: computationally modeling the effects of reduced phonetic distinctiveness on lexical uniqueness | year=1997 | journal=J Acoust Soc Am | pages=3704–10 | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = LE | doi=10.1121/1.420402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feld J1, Sommers M 2011 There Goes the Neighborhood: Lipreading and the Structure of the Mental Lexicon. ''Speech Commun.''  Feb;53(2):220-228&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, excellent lipreading is often associated with more broad-based cognitive skills including general language proficiency, [[executive function]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid=24129010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feld | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2009 | title = Lipreading, processing speed, and working memory in younger and older adults | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 52 | issue = 6| pages = 1555–65 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0137) | pmid = 19717657 | pmc=3119632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipreading and language learning in hearing infants and children==

===The first few months===

Seeing the mouth plays a role in the very young infant's early sensitivity to speech, and prepares them to become speakers at 1 – 2 years. In order to imitate, a baby must learn to shape their lips in accordance with the sounds they hear; seeing the speaker may help them to do this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/16/babies-learning-to-talk_n_1209219.html&lt;/ref&gt; Newborns imitate adult mouth movements such as sticking out the tongue or opening the mouth, which could be a precursor to further imitation and later language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 897687 | volume=198 | title=Imitation of facial and manual gestures by human neonates | year=1977 | journal=Science | pages=74–8 | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = AN | last2 = Moore | first2 = MK | doi=10.1126/science.897687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are disturbed when audiovisual speech of a familiar speaker is desynchronized &lt;ref&gt;Dodd B.1976 Lip reading in infants: attention to speech presented in- and out-of-synchrony. ''Cognitive Psychology'' Oct;11(4):478-84&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to show different looking patterns for familiar than for unfamiliar faces when matched to (recorded) voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spelke | first1 = E | year = 1976 | title = Infants intermodal perception of events | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 553–560 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(76)90018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants are sensitive to [[McGurk effect|McGurk illusions]] months before they have learned to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnham | first1 = D | last2 = Dodd | first2 = B | year = 2004 | title = Auditory-visual speech integration by prelinguistic infants: perception of an emergent consonant in the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 204–20 | doi = 10.1002/dev.20032 | pmid = 15549685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9136265 | volume=59 | title=The McGurk effect in infants | year=1997 | journal=Percept Psychophys | pages=347–57 | last1 = Rosenblum | first1 = LD | last2 = Schmuckler | first2 = MA | last3 = Johnson | first3 = JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and many more point to a role for vision in the development of sensitivity to (auditory) speech in the first half-year of life.

===The next six months; a role in learning a native language===

Until around six months of age, most hearing infants are sensitive to a wide range of speech gestures - including ones that can be seen on the mouth - which may or may not later be part of the [[phonology]] of their native language. But in the second six months of life, the hearing infant shows [[perceptual narrowing]] for the phonetic structure of their own language - and may lose the early sensitivity to mouth patterns that are not useful. The speech sounds  /v/ and /b/ which are visemically distinctive in English but not in Castilian Spanish are accurately distinguished in Spanish-exposed and English-exposed babies up to the age of around 6 months. However, older Spanish-exposed infants lose the ability to 'see' this distinction, while it is retained for English-exposed infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pons | first1 = F | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Narrowing of intersensory speech perception in infancy | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 106 | issue = 26| pages = 10598–602 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0904134106 | pmid = 19541648 | pmc=2705579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies suggest that rather than hearing and vision developing in independent ways in infancy, multimodal processing is the rule, not the exception, in (language) development of the infant brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Ghazanfar | first2 = AA | year = 2009 | title = The emergence of multisensory systems through perceptual narrowing | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 11| pages = 470–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.004 | pmid=19748305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early language production: one to two years===

Given the many studies indicating a role for vision in the development of language in the pre-lingual infant, the effects of congenital blindness on language development are surprisingly small.  18-month-olds learn new words more readily when they hear them, and do not learn them when they are shown the speech movements without hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Havy, M., Foroud, A., Fais, L., &amp; Werker, J.F. (in press; online January 26, 2017). The role of auditory and visual speech in word-learning at 18 months and in adulthood. Child Development.  (Pre-print version)&lt;/ref&gt; However, children blind from birth can confuse /m/ and /n/ in their own early production of English words – a confusion rarely seen in sighted hearing children, since  /m/ and /n/ are visibly distinctive, but auditorilly confusable.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, A.E. 1987 The development of phonology in the blind child. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell(Eds) Hearing by Eye: the psychology of lipreading, Hove UK, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; The role of vision in children aged 1–2 years may be less critical to the production of their native language, since, by that age, they have attained the skills they need to identify and imitate speech sounds. However, hearing a non-native language can shift the child's attention to visual and auditory engagement by way of lipreading and listening in order to process, understand and produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Hansen-Tift | first2 = AM | date = Jan 2012 | title = Infants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 1431–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1114783109 | pmid = 22307596 | pmc=3277111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In childhood===
Studies with pre-lingual infants and children use indirect, non-verbal measures to indicate sensitivity to seen speech. ''Explicit'' lip-reading can be reliably tested in hearing preschoolers by asking them to 'say aloud what I say silently'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies R1 | first1 = Kidd E | last2 = Lander | first2 = K | year = 2009 | title = Investigating the psycholinguistic correlates of speechreading in preschool age children | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 164–74 | doi = 10.1080/13682820801997189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In school-age children, lipreading of familiar closed-set words such as number words can be readily elicited.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd B. 1987 The acquisition of lipreading skills by normally hearing children. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell (Eds) Hearing by Eye, Erlbaum NJ pp163-176&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences in lip-reading skill, as tested by asking the child to 'speak the word that you lip-read', or by matching a lip-read utterance to a picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jerger | first1 = S | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Developmental shifts in children's sensitivity to visual speech: a new multimodal picture-word task | url = | journal = J Exp Child Psychol | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 40–59 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.08.002 | pmid = 18829049 | pmc=2612128}}&lt;/ref&gt; show a relationship between lip-reading skill and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyle | first1 = FE | last2 = Campbell | first2 = R | last3 = Mohammed | first3 = T | last4 = Coleman | first4 = M | last5 = MacSweeney | first5 = M | year = 2013 | title = Speechreading development in deaf and hearing children: introducing the test of child speechreading | url = | journal = Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 416–26 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0039) | pmid = 23275416 | pmc=4920223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid = 24129010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In hearing adults: lifespan considerations==
While lip-reading silent speech poses a challenge for most hearing people, adding sight of the speaker to heard speech improves speech processing under many conditions. The mechanisms for this, and the precise ways in which lip-reading helps, are topics of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peelle | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2015 | title = Prediction and constraint in audiovisual speech perception | journal = Cortex | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 169–81 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.006 | pmid=25890390 | pmc=4475441}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeing the speaker helps at all levels of speech processing from [[Phonetics|phonetic feature]] discrimination to interpretation of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] utterances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | year = 2008 | title = The processing of audio-visual speech: empirical and neural bases | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493| pages = 1001–1010 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2155 | pmid=17827105 | pmc=2606792}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The positive effects of adding vision to heard speech are greater in noisy than quiet environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumby | first1 = WH | last2 = Pollack | first2 = I | year = 1954 | title = Visual contribution to speech intelligibility in noise | doi = 10.1121/1.1907309 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 212–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
where by making speech perception easier, seeing the speaker can free up cognitive resources, enabling deeper processing of speech content.

As [[Hearing loss|hearing becomes less reliable in old-age]] people may tend to rely more on lip-reading, and are encouraged to do so. However, greater reliance on lip-reading may not always make good the effects of age-related hearing loss. Cognitive decline in aging may be preceded by and/or associated with measurable hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taljaard | first1 = Schmulian | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = The relationship between hearing impairment and cognitive function: A meta-analysis in adults | url = | journal = Clin Otolaryngol | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1111/coa.12607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = SC | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Hearing Loss is Associated With Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Case-Control Study in Older People | url = | journal = J Epidemiol | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 517–21 | doi = 10.2188/jea.JE20140147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus lipreading may not always be able to fully compensate for the combined hearing and cognitive age-related decrements.

===In specific (hearing) populations===

A number of studies report anomalies of lipreading in populations with distinctive developmental disorders. [[Autism]]:  People with autism may show reduced lipreading abilities and reduced reliance on vision in audiovisual speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = EG | last2 = Bennetto | first2 = L.J | year = 2007 | title = Audiovisual speech integration and lipreading in autism | url = | journal = Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 813–21 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01766.x | pmid = 17683453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Tornatore | first2 = LA | last3 = Brancazio | first3 = L | last4 = Whalen | first4 = DH | year = 2011 | title = Can children with autism spectrum disorders "hear" a speaking face? | url = | journal = Child Dev | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1397–403 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01619.x | pmid = 21790542 | pmc=3169706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be associated with gaze-to-the-face anomalies in these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Brancazio | first2 = L | year = 2014 | title = Seeing to hear?

==Deafness==
"When you are deaf you live inside a well-corked glass bottle. You see the entrancing outside world, but it does not reach you. After learning to lip read, you are still inside the bottle, but the cork has come out and the outside world slowly but surely comes in to you." &lt;ref name="Clegg1953"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|Debate has raged for hundreds of years]] over the role of lip-reading ('[[oralism]]') compared with other communication methods (most recently, [[total communication]]) in the education of deaf people. The extent to which one or other approach is beneficial depends on a range of factors, including level of hearing loss of the deaf person, age of hearing loss, parental involvement and parental language(s). Then there is a question concerning the aims of the deaf person and her community and carers. Is the aim of education to enhance communication generally, to develop [[sign language]] as a first language, or to develop skills in the spoken language of the hearing community? Researchers now focus on which aspects of language and communication may be best delivered by what means and in which contexts, given the hearing status of the child and her family, and their educational plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handsandvoices.org/articles/research/v9-2_marschark.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bimodal bilingualism]] (proficiency in both speech and sign language) is one dominant current approach in language education for the deaf child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swanwick | first1 = R | year = 2016 | title = Deaf Children's bimodal bilingualism and education | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 49 | issue = 01| pages = 1–34 | doi = 10.1017/S0261444815000348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf people  are often better lip-readers than people with normal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Demorest | first2 = ME | last3 = Tucker | first3 = PE | year = 2000 | title = Speech perception without hearing | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 233–52 | doi=10.3758/bf03205546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deaf people practice as professional lipreaders, for instance in [[forensic lipreading]]. In deaf people who have a [[cochlear implant]], pre-implant lip-reading skill can predict post-implant (auditory or audiovisual) speech processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergeson TR1 | first1 = Pisoni DB | last2 = Davis | first2 = RA | year = 2005 | title = Development of audiovisual comprehension skills in prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants | url = | journal = Ear &amp; Hearing | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 149–64 | doi=10.1097/00003446-200504000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many deaf people, access to spoken communication can be helped when a spoken message is relayed via a trained, ''[http://lipspeaking.co.uk/ professional lip-speaker]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/communication-support-for-deaf-people&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lipspeaker.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with lipreading and literacy development, children born deaf typically show [[Reading disability|delayed development of literacy]] skills&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/reading-and-dyslexia-deaf-children&lt;/ref&gt; which can reflect difficulties in acquiring elements of the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = What really matters in the early literacy development of deaf children | url = | journal = J Deaf Stud Deaf Educ | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 411–31 | doi=10.1093/deafed/enm020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reliable [[Phonics|phoneme-grapheme mapping]] may be more difficult for deaf children, who need to be skilled speech-readers in order to master this necessary step in literacy acquisition.  Lip-reading skill is associated with literacy abilities in deaf adults and children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02699200500266745 | volume=20 | title=Speechreading and its association with reading among deaf, hearing and dyslexic individuals | journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics | pages=621–630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyle | first1 = F.

[[Cued Speech]] uses lipreading with accompanying hand shapes that disambiguate the visemic (consonant) lipshape. Cued speech is said to be easier for hearing parents to learn than a sign language, and studies, primarily from Belgium, show that a deaf child exposed to cued speech in infancy can make more efficient progress in learning a spoken language than from lipreading alone
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = GH | last2 = Ling | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Cued Speech and the reception of spoken language | url = | journal = J Speech Hear Res | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 262–9 | doi=10.1044/jshr.2502.262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cued speech in cochlear implantation for deafness is likely to be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leybaert | first1 = J | last2 = LaSasso | first2 = CJ | year = 2010 | title = Cued speech for enhancing speech perception and first language development of children with cochlear implants | url = | journal = Trends in Amplification | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 96–112 | doi = 10.1177/1084713810375567 | pmc = 4111351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach, involving the use of handshapes accompanying seen speech, is  [http://seethesound.org/visual_phonics.html Visual Phonics], which is used by some educators to support the learning of  written and spoken language.

==Teaching and training==
The aim of teaching and training in lipreading is to develop awareness of the nature of lipreading, and to practice ways of improving the ability to perceive speech 'by eye'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lipreading.org/lipreading-&lt;/ref&gt; Lipreading classes, often called ''lipreading and managing hearing loss classes'', are mainly aimed at adults who have hearing loss. The highest proportion of adults with hearing loss have an [[Presbycusis|age related]], or [[Occupational hearing loss|noise related loss]], and with both these the high frequency sounds are lost first. Since many of the consonants in speech are high frequency sounds, speech becomes distorted. Hearing aids help, but may not cure this. Lipreading classes have been shown to be of benefit in  UK studies  commissioned by the charity, [[Action on Hearing Loss]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/notjustlipservice.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012.

Trainers recognise that lipreading is an inexact art. Students are taught to watch the lips, tongue and jaw movements, to follow the stress and rhythm of language, to use their residual hearing, with or without hearing aids, to watch expression and body language, and use their ability to put two and two together. They are taught the [http://limpingchicken.com/2016/04/05/molly-berry-what-lipreading-classes-can-offer-deaf-people/  lipreaders alphabet], groups of sounds that look alike on the lips (visemes) like p, b, m, or f, v. The aim is to get the gist, so as to have the confidence to join in conversation, and avoid damaging social isolation that often accompanies hearing loss. Lipreading classes are recommended for anyone who struggles to hear in noise, and help to adjust to hearing loss.

=== Tests ===

Most tests of lipreading were devised to measure individual differences in performing specific speech processing tasks, and to detect changes in performance following training.  Lipreading tests have been used with relatively small groups in experimental settings,  or as clinical indicators with individual patients and clients. That is, lipreading tests to date have limited validity as markers of lipreading skill in the general population.

==Lipreading and lip-speaking by machine==
[[Automated Lip Reading|Automated lip-reading]] has been a topic of interest in computational engineering, as well as in [[2001: A Space Odyssey|science fiction movies]]. The computational engineer [[Steve Omohundro]], among others, pioneered its development. In [[facial animation]], the aim is to generate realistic facial actions, especially mouth movements, that simulate human speech actions. Computer algorithms to deform or manipulate images of faces can be driven by heard or written language. Systems may be based on detailed models derived from facial movements ([[motion capture]]); on anatomical modelling of actions of the jaw, mouth and tongue; or on mapping of known viseme- phoneme properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rwalker/Walker/Publications_files/1996_CohenWalker%26Massaro_VisualSpeech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A318099&amp;dswid=2041&lt;/ref&gt; Facial animation has been used in speechreading training (demonstrating how different sounds 'look').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f#/page-1 | doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f | volume=33 | title=Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Animated Tutor for Vocabulary and Language Learning in Children with Autism | journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | pages=653–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are a subset of [[speech synthesis]] modelling which aim to deliver reliable 'text-to-(seen)-speech' outputs.  A complementary aim—the  reverse of making faces move in speech—is to develop computer algorithms  that can deliver realistic interpretations of speech (i.e. a written transcript or audio record)  from natural video data of a face in action: this is facial speech recognition. These models too can be sourced from a variety of data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/visual-speech-synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic visual speech recognition from video has been quite successful in distinguishing different languages (from a corpus of spoken language data).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/lip-reading-computer-can-distinguish-languages/&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration models, using machine-learning algorithms, have had some success in lipreading speech elements, such as specific words, from video&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2vInqqHX8&lt;/ref&gt;  and for identifying hard-to-lipread phonemes from visemically similar seen mouth actions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/the-innovators-can-computers-be-taught-to-lip-read-artificial-intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; Machine-based speechreading is now making successful use of [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602949/ai-has-beaten-humans-at-lip-reading/ neural-net based algorithms] which use large databases of speakers and speech material (following the successful model for auditory [[automatic speech recognition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2113299-googles-deepmind-ai-can-lip-read-tv-shows-better-than-a-pro/&lt;/ref&gt;

Uses for machine lipreading could include automated lipreading of video-only records, automated lipreading of speakers with damaged vocal tracts, and speech processing in face-to-face video (i.e. from videophone data). Automated lipreading may help in processing noisy or unfamiliar speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Bodoff/publication/234819242_An_improved_automatic_lipreading_system_to_enhance_speech_recognition/links/5628b96008ae04c2aeaeb404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Automated lipreading may  contribute to [[biometric]] person identification, replacing password-based identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol1/954/a954.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetbiometrics.com-article-details-i-2250&lt;/ref&gt;

==The brain==
Following the discovery that [[Auditory cortex|auditory brain regions]], including [[Heschl's gyrus]], were activated by seen speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calvert | first1 = GA | last2 = Bullmore | first2 = ET | last3 = Brammer | first3 = MJ | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1997 | title = Activation  of auditory cortex during silent lipreading | url = | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5312| pages = 593–6 | pmid = 9110978 | doi=10.1126/science.276.5312.593}}&lt;/ref&gt; the neural circuitry for speechreading was shown to include supra-modal processing regions, especially [[superior temporal sulcus]] (all parts) as well as posterior inferior occipital-temporal regions including regions specialised for the processing of [[Fusiform face area|faces]] and [[visual area MT|biological motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Liebenthal | first2 = E | year = 2014 | title = Neural pathways for visual speech perception | url = | journal = Front Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 386 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00386 | pmid = 25520611 | pmc=4248808}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some but not all studies, activation of Broca's area is reported for speechreading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skipper | first1 = JI | last2 = van Wassenhove | first2 = V | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = HC | last4 = Small | first4 = SL | year = 2007 | title = Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices: How Cortical Areas Supporting Speech Production Mediate Audiovisual Speech Perception | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 2387–2399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhl147 | pmid=17218482 | pmc=2896890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11587893 | volume=12 | title=Cortical substrates for the perception of face actions: an fMRI study of the specificity of activation for seen speech and for meaningless lower-face acts (gurning) | year=2001 | journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res | pages=233–43 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M | last3 = Surguladze | first3 = S | last4 = Calvert | first4 = G | last5 = McGuire | first5 = P | last6 = Suckling | first6 = J | last7 = Brammer | first7 = MJ | last8 = David | first8 = AS | doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(01)00054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that articulatory mechanisms can be activated in speechreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swaminathan | first1 = S. | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M. | last3 = Boyles | first3 = R. | last4 = Waters | first4 = D. | last5 = Watkins | first5 = K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6624">{{About| the mechanism of loss of angular momentum in a star| the alternative to conventional friction brakes |Eddy current brake}}

[[Image:Solar Magnetic Field Lines.jpg|thumb|The magnetic field lines rotate together with the Sun as a solid object. Ionized material carried along the field lines will at some point &lt;math&gt; r_c &lt;/math&gt; escape the magnetic field lines and thus take away the Sun's angular momentum]]
'''Magnetic braking''' is a theory explaining the loss of stellar [[angular momentum]] due to material getting captured by the [[stellar magnetic field]] and thrown out at great distance from the surface of the star. It plays an important role in the evolution of [[binary star]] systems.

==The problem==
The currently accepted theory of the [[solar systems|solar system's]] evolution states that the Solar System originates from a contracting gas cloud. As the cloud contracts, the [[angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt; must be [[angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]]. Any small net rotation of the cloud will cause the spin to increase as the cloud collapses, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a [[protostar]] forms, which gains heat from the [[gravitational energy]] of the collapse. As the collapse continues, the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to [[centrifugal force]] at the equator.

Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000 years of the star's life to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind. In the case of our own Sun, when the planets' angular momenta are compared to the Sun's own, the Sun has less than 1% of its supposed angular momentum. In other words, the Sun has slowed down its spin while the planets have not.

==The idea behind magnetic braking==
Ionized material captured by the magnetic field lines will rotate with the Sun as if it were a solid body. As material escapes from the Sun due to the [[solar wind]], the highly ionized material will be captured by the field lines and rotate with the same angular velocity as the Sun, even though it is carried far away from the Sun's surface, until it eventually escapes. This effect of carrying mass far from the centre of the Sun and throwing it away slows down the spin of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ferreira, J.; Pelletier, G.; Appl, S. |title=Reconnection X-winds: spin-down of low-mass protostars |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |year=2000 |volume=312 |issue=2 |pages=387–397 |bibcode=2000MNRAS.312..387F |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03215.x |citeseerx=10.1.1.30.5409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Devitt |title=What Puts The Brakes On Madly Spinning Stars? |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/5732 |accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is used in slowing the spin of a [[Yo-yo de-spin|rotating satellite]]; here two wires spool out weights to a distance slowing the satellites spin, then the wires are cut, letting the weights escape into space and permanently robbing the spacecraft of its [[angular momentum]].

==Theory behind magnetic braking==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
{{original research section|date=April 2013}}
As ionized material follows the Sun's magnetic field lines, due to the effect of the field lines being frozen in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], the charged particles feel a force &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; of the magnitude:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field vector.  This bending action forces the particles to "[[corkscrew]]" around the magnetic field lines while held in place by a "magnetic pressure"&lt;math&gt; P_B &lt;/math&gt;, or "energy density", while rotating together with the Sun as a solid body:

:&lt;math&gt;P_B=\frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} &lt;/math&gt;

Since magnetic field strength decreases with the cube of the distance there will be a place where the kinetic gas pressure &lt;math&gt; P_g &lt;/math&gt; of the ionized gas is great enough to break away from the field lines:

:&lt;math&gt; P_g=n m v^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where n is the number of particles, m is the mass of the individual particle and v is the radial velocity away from the Sun, or the speed of the solar wind.

The magnetic field strength as a function of radius can be approximated as:
:&lt;math&gt; B(r)=\frac{D_\odot}{r^3}  &lt;/math&gt;

The critical distance where the material will break away from the field lines can then be calculated as the distance where the kinetic pressure and the magnetic pressure are equal, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; P_B=P_g \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{B(rc)^2}{2\mu_0}=n m v^2\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D_{\odot}^2}{2\mu_0 r_c^6}=n m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the solar mass loss is omni-directional then the mass loss &lt;math&gt;n m= \frac{dM/dt}{4\pi r^2 v}&lt;/math&gt;; plugging this into the above equation and isolating the critical radius it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\left(\frac{2\pi D_\odot ^2}{\mu_0 v \dot{M}}\right)^{1 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;

===Present day value===
Currently it is estimated that:
* The mass loss of the Sun is about &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}=dM/dt=2 \cdot 10^9 kg/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The solar wind speed is  &lt;math&gt;v=5\cdot10^5m/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The dipole field is &lt;math&gt;D_{\odot}=8 \cdot 10^{22} T m^3&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a critical radius &lt;math&gt;r_c =3.4 R_\odot&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the ionized plasma will rotate together with the Sun as a solid body until it reaches a distance of nearly 3.4 the radius of the Sun; from there the material will break off and stop affecting the Sun.

The amount of solar mass needed to be thrown out along the field lines to make the Sun completely stop rotating can then be calculated using the specific angular momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{j_\odot}{j_c}=\left(\frac{R_\odot}{r_c}\right)^2 \approx 10\%&lt;/math&gt;
About 1/10 of the solar mass should thus have been lost by now due to this effect, but if the  present mass loss rate was stable throughout the Sun's "life" only about 0.01% of the Sun's original mass would have been lost. This indicates that either the Sun's mass loss must have been higher in the past or that the Sun's magnetic field has been much stronger.

A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of a model, and metamodeling is the process of generating such metamodels. Thus '''metamodeling''' or '''meta-modeling''' is the analysis, construction and development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and theories applicable and useful for [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] a predefined class of problems. As its name implies, this concept applies the notions of [[meta-]] and modeling in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]]. Metamodels are of many types and have diverse applications.&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]], Chapter 12 Metamodel-Based Fast AMS-SoC Design Methodologies, "[http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071825711 Nanoelectronic Mixed-Signal System Design]", {{ISBN|978-0071825719}} and 0071825711, 1st Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of the model, i.e. a simplified model of an actual model of a circuit, system, or software like entity.&lt;ref&gt; Oleg Garitselov, [[Saraju Mohanty]], and Elias Kougianos, "[http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf A Comparative Study of Metamodels for Fast and Accurate Simulation of Nano-CMOS Circuits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211500/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}", IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Vol. 25, No. 1, February 2012, pp. 26–36. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]] [http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf Ultra-Fast Design Exploration of Nanoscale Circuits through Metamodeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211443/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, Invited Talk, Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), Texas Analog Center for Excellence (TxACE), 27 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Metamodel can be a mathematical relation or algorithm representing input and output relations. A [[model (abstract)|model]] is an abstraction of phenomena in the [[Real life (reality)|real world]];  a metamodel is yet another abstraction, highlighting properties of the model itself.  A model conforms to its metamodel in the way that a computer program conforms to the grammar of the programming language in which it is written. Various types of metamodels include polynomial equations, neural network, [[Kriging]], etc. "Metamodeling" is the construction of a collection of "concepts" (things, terms, etc.) within a certain domain. Metamodeling typically involves studying the output and input relationships and then fitting right metamodels to represent that behavior.  

Common uses for metamodels are:
* As a [[logical schema|schema]] for [[semantic]] data that needs to be exchanged or stored
* As a language that supports a particular method or process
* As a language to express additional semantics of existing information
* As a mechanism to create tools that work with a broad class of models at run time
* As a schema for modeling and automatically exploring sentences of a language with applications to automated test synthesis
* As an approximation of a higher-fidelity model for use when reducing computational cost is necessary

Because of the "meta" character of metamodeling, both the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and theory of metamodels are of relevance to [[wikt:metascience|metascience]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[metatheory|metatheories]] and [[systemics]], and meta-consciousness.  The concept can be useful in [[mathematics]], and has practical applications in [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]]/[[software engineering]]. The latter are the main focus of this article.

=== Definition ===
In [[software engineering]], the use of [[model (abstract)|model]]s is an alternative to more common code-based development techniques. A model always conforms to a unique metamodel. One of the currently most active branch of [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the approach named [[model-driven architecture]] proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]]. This approach is based on the utilization of a language to write metamodels called the [[Meta-Object Facility|Meta Object Facility or MOF]]. Typical metamodels proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]] are [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]], SPEM or CWM. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has also published the standard metamodel [[ISO/IEC 24744]].&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission, 2007. [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38854 ISO/IEC 24744]. Software Engineering - Metamodel for Development Methodologies.&lt;/ref&gt; All the languages presented below could be defined as MOF metamodels.

=== Metadata modeling ===
[[Metadata modeling]] is a type of metamodeling used in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]] for the analysis and construction of models applicable and useful to some predefined class of problems. (see also: [[data modeling]]).

=== Model transformations ===
One important move in [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the systematic use of [[Model Transformation Language]]s. The OMG has proposed a standard for this called [[QVT]] for Queries/Views/Transformations. [[QVT]] is based on the [[Meta-Object Facility]] or MOF. Among many other [[Model Transformation Language]]s (MTLs), some examples of implementations of this standard are AndroMDA, [[VIATRA]], [[Tefkat]], [[MT (Model Transformation Language)|MT]], [[ManyDesigns Portofino]].

=== Relationship to ontologies ===
Meta-models are closely related to [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. Both are often used to describe and analyze the relations between concepts&lt;ref&gt;E. Söderström, et al. (2001) "Towards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages", in: ''Lecture Notes In Computer Science''; Vol. 2348. Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. Pages: 600 – 611, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ontologies: express something meaningful within a specified universe or [[domain of discourse]] by utilizing a grammar for using vocabulary. The grammar specifies what it means to be a well-formed statement, assertion, query, etc. (formal constraints) on how terms in the ontology’s controlled vocabulary can be used together.&lt;ref name=PidcockArticle&gt;

* Meta-modeling: can be considered as an ''explicit'' description (constructs and rules) of how a domain-specific model is built. In particular, this comprises a formalized specification of the domain-specific notations. Typically, metamodels are – and always should follow - a strict rule set.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Types of metamodels ===
For software engineering, several ''types'' of models (and their corresponding modeling activities) can be distinguished:
*[[Metadata modeling]] (MetaData Model)
*[[Meta-Process Modeling]] (MetaProcess Model)
*Executable Meta-Modeling (combining both of the above and much more, as in the general purpose tool [[Kermeta]])
*[[Model Transformation Language]] (see below)
*[[Polynomial Metamodels]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]] and Elias Kougianos, "[http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2014/Mohanty_ALOG_2014Jun.pdf Polynomial Metamodel Based Fast Optimization of Nano-CMOS Oscillator Circuits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810034704/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2014/Mohanty_ALOG_2014Jun.pdf |date=10 August 2014 }}", Springer Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing Journal, Volume 79, Issue 3, June 2014, pp. 437--453. &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neural network]] Metamodels
*[[Kriging]] Metamodels
*[[Piecewise Polynomial (Spline) Metamodels]]
*[[Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)]]

=== Zoos of metamodels ===
A library of similar metamodels has been called a Zoo of metamodels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf Jean-Marie Favre: Towards a Basic Theory to Model Driven Engineering.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015181841/http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf |date=15 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several types of meta-model zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ AtlanticZoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429205711/http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ |date=29 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are expressed in ECore. Others are written in [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] 1.4 - [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] 1.2. The metamodels expressed in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]]1.2 may be uploaded in [[Poseidon for UML]], a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tool.

[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Catholic philosopher]] of the [[Middle Ages]], revived and developed the concept of natural law from [[ancient Greek philosophy]].]]

'''Natural law''' ({{lang-la|ius naturale}}, ''lex naturalis'') is a [[philosophy]] asserting that certain [[human right|rights]] are inherent by virtue of [[human nature]], endowed by [[nature]]—traditionally by [[God]] or a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] source—and that these can be understood universally through [[human reason]]. As determined by nature, the '''law of nature''' is implied to be objective and universal;&lt;ref name="IESS"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Strauss|first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Strauss |title=Natural Law |encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |year=1968 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; it exists independently of human understanding, and of the [[positive law]] of a given [[Sovereign state|state]], [[political order]], [[legislature]] or [[society]] at large.

Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze [[human nature]] to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] binding rules of [[moral behavior]] from nature's or God's creation of [[reality]] and [[Human|mankind]]. The concept of natural law was documented in [[ancient Greek philosophy]], including [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommen, Heinrich A., ''The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social Philosophy'' trans. Thomas R. Hanley, O.S.B., Ph.D. (B. Herder Book Co., 1947 [reprinted 1959]), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in [[Roman philosophy]] by [[Cicero]]. References to natural law are also found in the Old and New Testaments of the [[Bible]], later expounded upon in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Christian philosopher]]s such as [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The [[School of Salamanca]] made notable contributions during the [[Renaissance]]. Modern natural law theories were greatly developed in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], combining inspiration from [[Roman law]] with philosophies like [[social contract]] theory. Key proponents were [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], [[John Locke]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]],  [[Emmerich de Vattel]], [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Francesco Mario Pagano]]. It was used to challenge the [[divine right of kings]], and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[government]]—and thus legal rights—in the form of [[classical republicanism]]. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

Contemporarily, the concept of natural law is closely related to the concept of [[natural rights]]. Indeed, many [[philosopher]]s, [[jurist]]s and scholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights ({{lang-la|[[ius naturale]]}}), or [[natural justice]].&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; while others distinguish between natural law and natural right.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt;

Because of the intersection between natural law and [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], natural law has been cited as a component in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776), and claimed by natural law proponents thus to be incorporated into its constitution, as well as in the [[France|French]] ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789), hence providing a foundation for the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' (1948) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

== History ==
The use of natural law, in its various incarnations, has varied widely throughout history. There are a number of theories of natural law, that differ from each other with respect to the role that morality plays in determining the authority of legal norms. This article deals with its usages separately rather than attempt to unify them into a single theory.

===Judaism===
Those who see [[Torah|biblical]] support for the doctrine of natural law often point to [[Abraham]]'s interrogation of [[God in Judaism|God]] on behalf of the iniquitous city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abraham even dares to tell the Most High that his plan to destroy the city (Genesis 18:25) would violate God’s own justice: “That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?" This almost Socratic reply became for later writers the beginnings of natural rights theory. In this respect, natural law as described in the interaction between Abraham and God predates the later Greek exposition of it by Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.

However, an even earlier set of laws is attributed to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The seven [[Noahidism|Noahide]] laws as traditionally enumerated are the following:&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared values: The Noahide Laws|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/shared-values-noahide-laws/|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Meri|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim-Jewish Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXF9DAAAQBAJ&amp; |date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-38320-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Not to worship idols.
# Not to curse God.
# To establish courts of justice.
# Not to commit murder.
# Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
# Not to steal.
# Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
According to the [[Genesis flood narrative]], a [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]] covered the whole world, killing every surface-dwelling creature except Noah, his wife, his sons and their wives, and the animals taken aboard [[Noah's Ark]]. According to this, all modern humans are descendants of Noah, thus the name Noahide Laws in reference to laws that apply to all of humanity. After the flood, God sealed a [[Covenant (Biblical)#Noahiccovenant|covenantwith Noah]] with the following admonitions ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9|HE}}):
* Flesh of a living animal: "Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.” (9:4)
* Murder and courts: "And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man." (9:5-6)

===Ancient Greece===
==== Plato ====
{{Original research section|date=May 2011}}Although [[Plato]] did not have an explicit theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase 'natural law' except in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 484 and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 83e), his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wild|first=John|year=1953|title=Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 508a.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the [[Theory of forms|forms]], most fundamentally the [[Form of the Good]], which Plato describes as "the brightest region of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', 518b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 540a, 517b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', 205e–6a.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'', Plato describes how the experience of the Beautiful by Socrates enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', 211d–e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the ideal community is "a city which would be established in accordance with nature".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 428e9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aristotle ====
{{see also|Treatise on Law}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]].]]
[[Greek philosophy]] emphasized the distinction between "nature" (''physis'', ''φúσις'') on the one hand and "law", "custom", or "convention" (''nomos'', ''νóμος'') on the other. What the law commanded would be expected to vary from place to place, but what was "by nature" should be the same everywhere. A "law of nature" would therefore have the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt; Against the [[conventionalism]] that the distinction between nature and custom could engender, [[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαιον φυσικον'', [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref name="Shellens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shellens|first=Max Solomon|title=Aristotle on Natural Law|journal=Natural Law Forum|volume=4|issue=1|year=1959|pages=72–100|doi=10.1093/ajj/4.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's association with natural law may be due to the interpretation given to his works by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Jaffa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffa|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry V. Jaffa|title=Thomism and Aristotelianism|origyear=1952|year=1979|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Corbett|first=Ross J.|title=The Philosophic Context of the Development of Natural Law| date=April 2012 |conference=Midwest Political Science Association|ssrn=2021235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle notes that [[natural justice]] is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of [[distributive justice|distributive]] and [[restorative justice|corrective justice]] that would be established under the best political community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' that the best regime may not rule by law at all.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ross J.|last=Corbett|title=The Question of Natural Law in Aristotle|journal=History of Political Thought|volume=30|issue=2| date=Summer 2009 |pages=229–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Universal law is the law of Nature. For there really is, as every one to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men, even on those who have no association or covenant with each other. It is this that Sophocles' Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition: she means that it was just by nature:

:"Not of to-day or yesterday it is,
:But lives eternal: none can date its birth."

And so Empedocles, when he bids us kill no living creature, he is saying that to do this is not just for some people, while unjust for others:

:"Nay, but, an all-embracing law, through the realms of the sky
:Unbroken it stretcheth, and over the earth's immensity."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Rhetoric, Book I – Chapter 13, {{cite web |url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213075009/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |archivedate=2015-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics believe that the context of this remark suggests only that Aristotle advised that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was averse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; Moreover, they claim that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law provided in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt; Aristotle's paternity of natural law tradition is consequently disputed.

==== Stoic natural law&lt;!--linked from 'Stoicism'--&gt; ====
The development of this tradition of [[natural justice]] into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. The rise of natural law as a universal system coincided with the rise of large empires and kingdoms in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Introduction to Jurisprudence'', Seventh Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} Whereas the "higher" law that Aristotle suggested one could appeal to was emphatically [[Appeal to nature|natural]], in contradistinction to being the result of [[Divinity|divine]] [[Positive law|positive]] [[legislation]], the Stoic natural law was indifferent to either the natural or divine source of the law: the Stoics asserted the existence of a rational and purposeful order to the universe (a [[Divine law|divine]] or [[eternal law]]), and the means by which a rational being lived in accordance with this order was the natural law, which inspired actions that accorded with virtue.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt;

As the English historian A. J. Carlyle (1861–1943) notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca&amp;nbsp;... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West, vol. 1|location=Edinburgh|year=1903|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that "the idea of the equality of men is the most profound contribution of the Stoics to political thought" and that "its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles H.|last=McIlwain|title=The Growth of Political Thought in the West: From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages|location=New York|year=1932|pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natural law first appeared among the stoics who believed that God is everywhere and in everyone (see [[classical pantheism]]). According to this belief, within humans there is a "divine spark" which helps them to live in accordance with nature. The stoics felt that there was a way in which the universe had been designed, and that natural law helped us to harmonise with this.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
[[Cicero]] wrote in his [[De Legibus]] that both justice and law originate from what nature has given to humanity, from what the human mind embraces, from the function of humanity, and from what serves to unite humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'', bk. 1, sec. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; For Cicero, natural law obliges us to contribute to the general good of the larger society.&lt;ref name="Barham"&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis|last=Barham|contribution=Introduction|title=The Political Works of Marcus Tullius Cicero|location=London|publisher=Edmund Spettigue|year=1842|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808205547/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of positive laws is to provide for "the safety of citizens, the preservation of states, and the tranquility and happiness of human life." In this view, "wicked and unjust statutes" are "anything but 'laws,'" because "in the very definition of the term 'law' there [[wikt:inheres|inheres]] the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 2, sec. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Law, for Cicero, "ought to be a reformer of vice and an incentive to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, sec. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero expressed the view that "the virtues which we ought to cultivate, always tend to our own happiness, and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits."&lt;ref name="Barham" /&gt;

In De Re Publica, he writes:
{{quote|There is indeed a law, right reason, which is in accordance with nature ; existing in all, unchangeable, eternal. Commanding us to do what is right, forbidding us to do what is wrong. It has dominion over good men, but possesses no influence over bad ones. No other law can be substituted for it, no part of it can be taken away, nor can it be abrogated altogether. Neither the people or the senate can absolve from it. It is not one thing at Rome, and another thing at Athens : one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow ; but it is eternal and immutable for all nations and for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303160447/http://www.archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |archivedate=2017-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero influenced the discussion of natural law for many centuries to come, up through the era of the American Revolution. The jurisprudence of the [[Roman Empire]] was rooted in Cicero, who held "an extraordinary grip ... upon the imagination of posterity" as "the medium for the propagation of those ideas which informed the law and institutions of the empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Norris|last=Cochrane|title=Christianity and Classical Culture: A Study of Thought and Action from Augustus to Augustine|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1957|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's conception of natural law "found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum of Gratian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward S.|last=Corwin|title=The "Higher Law" Background of American Constitutional Law|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1955|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his summary of medieval natural law, quoted Cicero's statement that "nature" and "custom" were the sources of a society's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Treatise on Law'' (Summa Theologica, Questions 90–97), ed.

Cook, 21 Jan. 1816; quoted in ''Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The New Testament carries a further exposition on the Abrahamic dialogue and links to the later Greek exposition on the subject, when [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]] states: "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual historian A. J. Carlyle has commented on this passage, "There can be little doubt that St Paul's words imply some conception analogous to the 'natural law' in [[Cicero]], a law written in men's hearts, recognized by man's reason, a law distinct from the positive law of any State, or from what St Paul recognized as [[Torah|the revealed law of God]]. It is in this sense that St Paul's words are taken by the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries like [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary of Poitiers]], [[Ambrose|St Ambrose]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of their interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West|volume=1|page=83|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorymedival00carlgoog|location=New York|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|year=1903|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608004930/https://archive.org/details/ahistorymedival00carlgoog|archivedate=2016-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its origins in the Old Testament, early [[Church Fathers]], especially those in the [[Western Christianity|West]], saw natural law as part of the natural foundation of [[Christianity]]. The most notable among these was [[Augustine of Hippo]], who equated natural law with humanity's [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] state; as such, a life according to unbroken human nature was no longer possible and persons needed instead to seek healing and salvation through the [[divine law]] and [[divine grace|grace]] of [[Jesus Christ]].

In the twelfth century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] equated the natural law with divine law. [[Albertus Magnus]] would address the subject a century later, and his pupil, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' [[Treatise on Law|I-II qq. 90–106]], restored Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature's participation in the eternal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm#article2 Summa Theologica, I-II, Q. 91, Art. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704182120/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm |date=2007-07-04 }} "I answer that"&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the [[Eternal law]], it needed to be supplemented by revealed [[Divine law]]. (See also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].) Meanwhile, Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the 'appearance' of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a 'perversion of law.'&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologicae,'' Q. 95, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those  laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=Tony|year=2000|title=Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law|journal=Political Studies|volume=48|pages=929–46|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00288|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural law was inherently [[teleological]], however, it is most assuredly not [[deontological]]. For Christians, natural law is how human beings manifest the divine image in their life. This mimicry of [[Jesus Christ|God]]'s own life is impossible to accomplish except by means of the power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that humanity is made in God's image, humanity is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how humanity displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within human control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction may or may not be attained, but salvation will be attained. The [[State (polity)|state]], in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.

In the 16th century, the [[School of Salamanca]] ([[Francisco Suárez]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], etc.) further developed a philosophy of natural law.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], some [[Protestant denominations]] maintained parts of the Catholic concept of natural law. The [[England|English]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Richard Hooker]] from the [[Church of England]] adapted [[Thomism|Thomistic]] notions of natural law to [[Anglicanism]]  five principles: to live, to learn, to reproduce, to worship God, and to live in an ordered society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | title=Natural Law aspects of theory | publisher=Rsrevision.com | medium=[[PDF]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026050618/http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | archivedate=2014-10-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic natural law===
[[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], an [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]] and [[polymath]] [[Islamic science|scientist]], understood natural law as the survival of the fittest. He argued that the [[:wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] between [[human]] beings can only be overcome through a [[divine law]], which he believed to have been sent through [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. This is also the position of the [[Ashari]] school, the largest school of Sunni theology.&lt;ref name="Corbin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbin|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard and [[Philip Sherrard]]|publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies|isbn=0-7103-0416-1|page=39|year=1993|origyear= 1964}} (original in French.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), in his treatise on ''Justice and Jihad'' and his commentary on Plato's ''Republic'', writes that the human mind can know of the unlawfulness of killing and stealing and thus of the five [[maqasid]] or higher intents of the Islamic [[sharia]] or to protect religion, life, property, offspring, and reason. The concept of natural law entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through his Aristotelian commentaries, influencing the subsequent [[Averroism|Averroist]] movement and the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What the Law Requires Is Written on Their Hearts: Noachic and Natural Law among German-Speakers in Early Modern North America|first=A. G.|last=Roeber|journal=[[William and Mary Quarterly]]|series=Third Series|volume=58|issue=4|date=October 2001|pages=883–912 [887]|doi=10.2307/2674504|jstor=2674504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maturidi]] school, the second largest school of Sunni theology, posits the existence of a form of natural law. [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of 'good' and 'evil' without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which is known to be evil by reason alone due to people's working hard for their property. Killing, fornication, and drinking alcohol were all 'evils' the human mind could know of according to al-Maturidi. The concept of ''[[Istislah]]'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, ''istislah'' calls good whatever is connected to one of five "basic goods". [[Al-Ghazali]] abstracted these "basic goods" from the legal precepts in the Qur'an and Sunnah: they are religion, life, reason, lineage and property. Some add also "honour". [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] also posited that human reason could discern between 'great sins' and good deeds.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Brehon law&lt;!--linked from 'Early Irish law'--&gt;===
Early Irish law, An Senchus Mor (The Great Tradition) mentions in a number of places ''recht aicned'' or natural law. This is a concept predating European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: fír (truth) and dliged (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term córus (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have passed the test of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time&lt;ref&gt;Neil McLeod, ''The Concept of Law in Ancient Irish Jurisprudence'', in "Irish Jurist" 17 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were written in the oldest dialect of the Irish language, called Bérla Féini [Bairla-faina], which even at the time was so difficult that persons about to become brehons had to be specially instructed in it, the length of time from beginning to becoming a learned Brehon was usually 20 years.

To know what is right, one must use one's reason and apply it to Thomas Aquinas' precepts. This reason is believed to be embodied, in its most abstract form, in the concept of a primary precept: "Good is to be sought, evil avoided."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Thomas explains that:
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
there belongs to the natural law, first, certain most general precepts, that are known to all;
      and secondly, certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were,
      conclusions following closely from first principles. As to those general principles, the
      natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be blotted out from men's hearts. But it is blotted
      out in the case of a particular action, insofar as reason is hindered from applying the
      general principle to a particular point of practice, on account of concupiscence or some
      other passion, as stated above (77, 2). But as to the other, i.e., the secondary precepts, the
      natural law can be blotted out from the human heart, either by evil persuasions, just as in
      speculative matters errors occur in respect of necessary conclusions; or by vicious customs
      and corrupt habits, as among some men, theft, and even unnatural vices, as the Apostle
      states (Rm. i), were not esteemed sinful.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, while the primary and immediate precepts cannot be "blotted out", the secondary precepts can be. Therefore, for a deontological ethical theory they are open to a surprisingly large amount of interpretation and flexibility. Any rule that helps humanity to live up to the primary or subsidiary precepts can be a secondary precept, for example:
* Drunkenness is wrong because it injures one's health, and worse, destroys one's ability to reason, which is fundamental to humans as rational animals (i.e., does not support self-preservation).
* Theft is wrong because it destroys social relations, and humans are by nature social animals (i.e., does not support the subsidiary precept of living in society).

Natural moral law is concerned with both exterior and interior acts, also known as action and motive. Simply doing the right thing is not enough; to be truly moral one's motive must be right as well. For example, helping an old lady across the road (good exterior act) to impress someone (bad interior act) is wrong. However, good intentions don't always lead to good actions. The motive must coincide with the cardinal or theological virtues. [[Cardinal virtues]] are acquired through reason applied to nature; they are:
# [[Prudence]]
# [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]]
# [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]
# [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]]

The [[theological virtues]] are:

# [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]
# [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]
# [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]

According to Aquinas, to lack any of these virtues is to lack the ability to make a moral choice. For example, consider a person who possesses the virtues of justice, prudence, and fortitude, yet lacks temperance. Due to their lack of self-control and desire for pleasure, despite their good intentions, they will find themself swaying from the moral path.

===English jurisprudence===
Heinrich A. Rommen remarked upon "the tenacity with which the spirit of the English common law retained the conceptions of natural law and equity which it had assimilated during the Catholic Middle Ages, thanks especially to the influence of [[Henry de Bracton]] (d. 1268) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (d. cir. 1476)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Heinrich A.|last=Rommen|title=The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy|others=Trans. and rev.

Sir Edward Coke was the preeminent jurist of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's preeminence extended across the ocean: "For the American revolutionary leaders, 'law' meant Sir Edward Coke's custom and right reason."&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''In a Defiant Stance: The Conditions of Law in Massachusetts Bay, The Irish Comparison, and the Coming of the American Revolution'' (University Park, Penn.: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1977), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to [[James Madison]] in 1826 that before the Revolution, the first volume of Coke's ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' "was the universal elementary book of law students, and a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English liberties." See ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', vol. 16, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke defined law as "perfect reason, which commands those things that are proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things".&lt;ref&gt;John Underwood Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory," in ''Law, Liberty, and Parliament: Selected Essays on the Writings of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Allen D. Boyer (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004), pp. 108–09; citing Edward Coke, ''First Part of the Institutes'', 319b.&lt;/ref&gt; For Coke, human nature determined the purpose of law; and law was superior to any one person's reason or will.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory", p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's discussion of natural law appears in his report of ''Calvin's Case'' (1608): "The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction." In this case the judges found that "the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature: secondly, that the law of nature is part of the law of England: thirdly, that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law: fourthly, that the law of nature is immutable." To support these findings, the assembled judges (as reported by Coke, who was one of them) cited as authorities [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]]; as well as Bracton, Fortescue, and [[Christopher St. Germain|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, pp. 195–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Coke, the most famous common law jurist of the seventeenth century is [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]]. Hale wrote a treatise on natural law that circulated among English lawyers in the eighteenth century and survives in three manuscript copies.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, London, Add. MS 18235, fols. 41–147 [1693]; Harley MS 7159, fols. 1–266 [1696]; Hargrave MS 485 [late-eighteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; This natural-law treatise has been published as ''Of the Law of Nature'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hale, [http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature ''Of the Law of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514014830/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature |date=2016-05-14 }}, ed. David S. Sytsma (CLP Academic, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Hale's definition of the natural law reads: "It is the Law of Almighty God given by him to Man with his Nature discovering the morall good and moral evill of Moral Actions, commanding the former, and forbidding the latter by the secret voice or dictate of his implanted nature, his reason, and his concience."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed natural law as antecedent, preparatory, and subsequent to civil government,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 85–106.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that human law "cannot forbid what the Law of Nature injoins, nor Command what the Law of Nature prohibits."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited as authorities [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41, 52, 64, 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of Hobbes's reduction of natural law to self-preservation and Hobbes's account of the state of nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 43, 86, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but drew positively on  [[Hugo Grotius]]'s ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'', [[Francisco Suárez]]'s ''Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore'', and [[John Selden]]'s ''De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 7–8, 17, 49, 63, 111–19, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the thirteenth century, it was held that "the law of nature...is the ground of all laws"&lt;ref&gt;8 Edw 4 fol. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Chancellor and Judges that "it is required by the law of nature that every person, before he can be punish'd, ought to be present; and if absent by contumacy, he ought to be summoned and make default".&lt;ref&gt;9 Ed. 4 fol. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fort. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 1824, we find it held that "proceedings in our Courts are founded upon the law of England, and that law is again founded upon the law of nature and the revealed law of God. If the right sought to be enforced is inconsistent with either of these, the English municipal courts cannot recognize it."&lt;ref&gt;2 B. &amp; C. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes====
[[File:Thomas Hobbes.jpeg|thumb|right|190px|Thomas Hobbes]]
By the 17th century, the [[medieval]] [[teleology|teleological]] view came under intense criticism from some quarters. [[Thomas Hobbes]] instead founded a [[social contract|contractarian theory]] of [[legal positivism]] on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s modifications on [[legal positivism]] further developed the theory.

As used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his treatises ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and ''[[De Cive]]'', natural law is "a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Leviathan, pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hobbes, there are nineteen Laws. The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of Leviathan ("of the first and second natural laws; and of contracts"); the others in chapter XV ("of other laws of nature").
* The first law of nature is ''that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war''.
* The second law of nature is ''that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth, as for peace, and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.''
* The third law is ''that men perform their covenants made.'' In this law of nature consisteth the fountain and original of justice... when a covenant is made, then to break it is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than the not performance of covenant. And whatsoever is not unjust is just.
* The fourth law is ''that a man which receiveth benefit from another of mere grace, endeavour that he which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will.'' Breach of this law is called ingratitude.
* The fifth law is complaisance: ''that every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest.'' The observers of this law may be called sociable; the contrary, stubborn, insociable, forward, intractable.
* The sixth law is ''that upon caution of the future time, a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.''
* The seventh law is ''that in revenges, men look not at the greatness of the evil past, but the greatness of the good to follow.''
* The eighth law is ''that no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare hatred or contempt of another.'' The breach of which law is commonly called contumely.
* The ninth law is ''that every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature.'' The breach of this precept is pride.
* The tenth law is ''that at the entrance into the conditions of peace, no man require to reserve to himself any right, which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest.'' The breach of this precept is arrogance, and observers of the precept are called modest.
* The eleventh law is that ''if a man be trusted to judge between man and man, that he deal equally between them.''
* The twelfth law is ''that such things as cannot be divided, be enjoyed in common, if it can be; and if the quantity of the thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of them that have right.''
* The thirteenth law is ''the entire right, or else...the first possession'' (in the case of alternating use), of a thing that ''can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common'' should be determined by lottery.
* The fourteenth law is that ''those things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor divided, ought to be adjudged to the first possessor; and in some cases to the first born, as acquired by lot.''
* The fifteenth law is that ''all men that mediate peace be allowed safe conduct.''
* The sixteenth law is ''that they that are at controversie, submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator.''
* The seventeenth law is ''that no man is a fit Arbitrator in his own cause.''
* The eighteenth law is that no man should serve as a judge in a case if ''greater profit, or honour, or pleasure apparently ariseth [for him] out of the victory of one party, than of the other.''
* The nineteenth law is that in a disagreement of fact, the judge should not give more weight to the testimony of one party than another, and absent other evidence, should give credit to the testimony of other witnesses.

Hobbes's philosophy includes a frontal assault on the founding principles of the earlier natural legal tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution'' (Chapel Hill, 1992), pp. 372–73&lt;/ref&gt; disregarding the traditional association of virtue with happiness,&lt;ref&gt;A Hobbes Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111140201/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise re-defining "law" to remove any notion of the promotion of the common good.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stoner, Jr., ''Common Law and Liberal Theory: Coke, Hobbes, and the Origins of American Constitutionalism'' (Lawrence, Kansas, 1992), 71; see also John Phillip Reid, "In the Taught Tradition: The Meaning of Law in Massachusetts-Bay Two-Hundred Years Ago," ''Suffolk University Law Review'' 14 (1980), 938–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes has no use for [[Aristotle]]'s association of nature with human perfection, inverting Aristotle's use of the word "nature." Hobbes posits a primitive, unconnected state of nature in which men, having a "natural proclivity...to hurt each other" also have "a Right to every thing, even to one anothers body";&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''De Cive (The Citizen)'', ed. Sterling P. Lamprecht (New York, 1949; orig. 1642), ch. 2, sec. 2 (p. 29).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nothing can be Unjust" in this "warre of every man against every man" in which human life is "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, &amp; Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill'' (Mineola, N.Y., 2006; orig. 1651), pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 72); p. 1, ch. 13 (pp. 21, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting [[Cicero]]'s view that people join in society primarily through "a certain social spirit which nature has implanted in man,"&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De re publica'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, ch. 25, sec. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes declares that men join in society simply for the purpose of "getting themselves out from that miserable condition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent...to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep them in awe."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 2, ch. 17 (p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his campaign against the classical idea of natural human sociability, Hobbes inverts that fundamental natural legal maxim, the Golden Rule. Hobbes's version is ''"Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe."''&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 1, ch. 15 (p. 79)(emphasis in original). See also Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern'', p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cumberland's rebuttal of Hobbes====
The English cleric [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] wrote a lengthy and influential attack on Hobbes's depiction of individual self-interest as the essential feature of human motivation. Historian Knud Haakonssen has noted that in the eighteenth century, Cumberland was commonly placed alongside [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]] "in the triumvirate of seventeenth-century founders of the 'modern' school of natural law."&lt;ref&gt;Knud Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," in ''English Philosophy in the Age of Locke'', ed. M.A. Stewart (Oxford, 2000), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth-century philosophers [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] "were obviously inspired in part by Cumberland."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, ''Natural Law and Moral Philosophy: From Grotius to the Scottish Enlightenment'' (Cambridge, 1996), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jon Parkin likewise describes Cumberland's work as "one of the most important works of ethical and political theory of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's'' De Legibus Naturae (Bury St. Edmunds, United Kingdom, 1999), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Parkin observes that much of Cumberland's material "is derived from Roman [[Stoicism]], particularly from the work of [[Cicero]], as "Cumberland deliberately cast his engagement with Hobbes in the mould of Cicero's debate between the Stoics, who believed that nature could provide an objective morality, and [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]], who argued that morality was human, conventional and self-interested."&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Cumberland de-emphasized the overlay of Christian dogma (in particular, the doctrine of "original sin" and the corresponding presumption that humans are incapable of "perfecting" themselves without divine intervention) that had accreted to natural law in the Middle Ages.

By way of contrast to Hobbes's multiplicity of laws, Cumberland states in the very first sentence of his ''Treatise of the Laws of Nature'' that "all the Laws of Nature are reduc'd to that one, of Benevolence toward all Rationals."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cumberland, ''A Treatise of the Laws of Nature'', trans. John Maxwell (Indianapolis, 2005; orig. 1727), "Contents" (p. 237). Cumberland's treatise was originally published in Latin in 1672. A Latin edition was published in Germany in 1684.&lt;/ref&gt; He later clarifies: "By the name ''Rationals'' I beg leave to understand, as well ''God'' as ''Man''; and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero." Cumberland argues that the mature development ("perfection") of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 1, sec. 33 (p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; For Cumberland, human interdependence precludes Hobbes's natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival. However, Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of "[[enlightened self-interest]]." Rather, the "proper moral love of humanity" is "a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," pp. 34, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland concludes that actions "principally conducive to our Happiness" are those that promote "the Honour and Glory of God" and also "Charity and Justice towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 13 (pp. 523–24).&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the "pursuit of our own Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 12 (p. 525)&lt;/ref&gt; He cites "reason" as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in "the most extensive Benevolence," but he also mentions as "Essential Ingredients of Happiness" the "Benevolent Affections," meaning "Love and Benevolence towards others," as well as "that Joy, which arises from their Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 15 (pp. 527–28).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American jurisprudence====
The [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] states that it has become necessary for the people of the United States to assume "the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them". Some early American lawyers and judges perceived natural law as too tenuous, amorphous, and evanescent a legal basis for grounding concrete [[rights]] and [[Limited government|governmental limitations]].&lt;ref name=Edlin&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300065 |title=Judicial Review without a Constitution |author=Douglas E.

===European liberal natural law===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Dr Sir Albericus Gentilis (Father of international law).png|thumb|190px|[[Alberico Gentili|Dr Alberico Gentili]], the founder of the science of international law.]]
Liberal natural law grew out of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian natural law theories and out of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] revision of natural law, sometimes in an uneasy balance of the two.

[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] based their philosophies of international law on natural law. In particular, his writings on [[freedom of the seas]] and [[just war theory]] directly appealed to natural law. About natural law itself, he wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''[[De iure belli ac pacis]]'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous [[argument]] ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology. However, German church-historians Ernst Wolf and M. Elze disagreed and claimed that Grotius' concept of natural law did have a theological basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Wolf, ''Naturrecht'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band IV (1960), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1357&lt;/ref&gt; In Grotius' view, the [[Old Testament]] contained moral precepts (e.g. the [[Decalogue]]) which [[Christ]] confirmed and therefore were still valid. Moreover, they were useful in explaining the content of natural law. Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elze, ''Grotius, Hugo'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II (1958), col. 1885&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, [[Samuel Pufendorf]] gave natural law a theological foundation and applied it to his concepts of government and [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Hohlwein, ''Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V (1961), col. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (filtered through [[Richard Hooker]]) or [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] radical reinterpretation, though the effect of Locke's understanding is usually phrased in terms of a revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesian [[social contract|contractarian]] grounds. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''Two Treatises of Government'', Second Treatise, Chapter 13, §149&lt;/ref&gt;

While Locke spoke in the language of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher [[Jeremy Waldron]] has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron (2002), ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''. Cambridge University Press, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the [[Decalogue]], [[Christ]]'s teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 12–15, 45–46, 95–97, 195–98, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the [[equality of the sexes]] ("Adam and Eve"), from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/? Genesis 1, 26–28], the starting-point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 21–43&lt;/ref&gt; One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], arguably echoing Locke, appealed to [[inalienable rights|unalienable rights]] in the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are ''created'' equal, that they are endowed by their ''Creator'' with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lockean idea that governments need the [[consent of the governed]] was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005),''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 49–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213180721/http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] theorist [[Murray Rothbard]] argues that "the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|chapter=Natural Law Versus Positive Law|pages=17|author=Rothbard, Murray|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126063000/http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Mises]] states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R.

Economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek|F. A. Hayek]] said that, originally, "the term 'natural' was used to describe an orderliness or regularity that was not the product of deliberate human will. Together with 'organism' it was one of the two terms generally understood to refer to the spontaneously grown in contrast to the invented or designed. Its use in this sense had been inherited from the stoic philosophy, had been revived in the twelfth century, and it was finally under its flag that the late Spanish Schoolmen developed the foundations of the genesis and functioning of spontaneously formed social institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=97–98|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that 'natural' was "the product of designing reason" is a product of a seventeenth century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] reinterpretation of the law of nature. [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]], for example, when referred to the 'natural' price, explained that it is "so called because 'it results from the thing itself without regard to laws and decrees, but is dependent on many circumstances which alter it, such as the sentiments of men, their estimation of different uses, often even in consequence of whims and pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1973, 1976, 1979, 1982|isbn=0-415-09868-8|location=London|pages=21|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008175341/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And even [[John Locke]], when talking about the foundations of natural law and explaining what he thought when citing "reason", said: "By reason, however, I do not think is meant here that faculty of the understanding which forms traint of thought and deduces proofs, but certain definite principles of action from which spring all virtues and whatever is necessary for the proper moulding of morals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays Concerning the Law of Nature|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=W. von Leyden|year=1954|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This anti-rationalist approach to human affairs, for Hayek, was the same which guided [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish enlightenment]] thinkers, such as [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]], to make their case for liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=98–99|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, no one can have the knowledge necessary to plan society, and this "natural" or "spontaneous" order of society shows how it can efficiently "plan" bottom-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|title=The Trend of Economic Thinking|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=22–24|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829053955/http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the idea that law is just a product of deliberate design, denied by natural law and linked to [[legal positivism]], can easily generate [[totalitarianism]]: "If law is wholly the product of deliberate design, whatever the designer decrees to be law is just by definition and unjust law becomes a contradiction in terms. The will of the duly authorized legislator is then wholly unfettered and guided solely by his concrete interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|title=The Constitution of Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=238–39|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926153103/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is wrong because law cannot be just a product of "reason": "no system of articulated law can be applied except within a framework of generally recognized but often unarticulated rules of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies In Philosophy, Politics And Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=102|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a secular critique of the natural law doctrine was stated by [[Pierre Charron]] in his ''De la sagesse'' (1601): "The sign of a natural law must be the universal respect in which it is held, for if there was anything that nature had truly commanded us to do, we would undoubtedly obey it universally: not only would every nation respect it, but every individual. Instead there is nothing in the world that is not subject to contradiction and dispute, nothing that is not rejected, not just by one nation, but by many; equally, there is nothing that is strange and (in the opinion of many) unnatural that is not approved in many countries, and authorized by their customs."

==Contemporary jurisprudence==

In [[jurisprudence]], ''natural law'' can refer to the several doctrines:
* That [[justice|just laws]] are [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature; that is, they can be "discovered" or "found" but not "created" by such things as a [[bill of rights]];
* That they can emerge by the natural process of resolving conflicts, as embodied by the evolutionary process of the common law; or
* That the meaning of law is such that its content cannot be determined except by reference to moral principles. These meanings can either oppose or complement each other, although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws.

Whereas [[legal positivism]] would say that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would say that there is something legally deficient about an unjust norm. [[Legal interpretivism]], famously defended in the English-speaking world by [[Ronald Dworkin]], claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.

Besides [[utilitarianism]] and [[Kantianism]], natural law jurisprudence has in common with [[virtue ethics]] that it is a live option for a [[first principles]] ethics theory in [[analytic philosophy]].

The concept of natural law was very important in the development of the English [[common law]]. In the struggles between [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[British monarchy|monarch]], Parliament often made reference to the [[Fundamental Laws of England]], which were at times said to embody natural law principles since [[time immemorial]] and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to [[William Blackstone]], however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of [[Equity (law)|equity]], but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication of natural law in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of [[legal positivism]], like [[Jeremy Bentham]], have also been staunch critics of the common law.

Natural law jurisprudence is currently undergoing a period of reformulation (as is legal positivism). The most prominent contemporary natural law jurist, Australian [[John Finnis]], is based in Oxford, but there are also Americans [[Germain Grisez]], [[Robert P. George]], and Canadian [[Joseph Boyle (jurist)|Joseph Boyle]] and Brazilian Emídio Brasileiro. All have tried to construct a new version of natural law. The 19th-century [[anarchism|anarchist]] and legal theorist, [[Lysander Spooner]], was also a figure in the expression of modern natural law.

"New Natural Law" as it is sometimes called, originated with Grisez. It focuses on "basic human goods", such as human life, knowledge, and aesthetic experience, which are [[Self-evidence|self-evidently]] and intrinsically worthwhile, and states that these goods reveal themselves as being [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]] with one another.

The tensions between the natural law and the positive law have played, and continue to play a key role in the development of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Prabhakar Singh, "From 'narcissistic' positive international law to 'universal' natural international law: the dialectics of 'absentee colonialism'", ''African Journal of International and Comparative Law'', 2008, 16(1), 56–82&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conservation status}}

A '''near-threatened species''' is a [[species]] which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] as "'''Near Threatened'''" (NT) by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as that may be considered [[Threatened species|threatened]] with [[extinct]]ion in the near future, although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] notes the importance of re-evaluating near-threatened [[taxa]] at appropriate intervals.

The rationale used for near-threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] which are plausible or nearly met, such as reduction in numbers or range. Near-threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened, whereas prior to this [[conservation-dependent species]] were given a separate category ("Conservation Dependent").

Additionally, the 402 conservation-dependent taxa may also be considered near-threatened.

== IUCN Categories and Criteria version 2.3 ==
[[File:Status iucn2.3 NT.svg|left|Diagram of ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}near threatened}}'' in the older IUCN version 2.3, beside the former ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}conservation dependent}}'' subcategory.]]

Prior to 2001, the IUCN used the version 2.3 Categories and Criteria to assign [[conservation status]], which included a separate category for [[conservation-dependent]] species ("Conservation Dependent", LR/cd). With this category system, Near Threatened and Conservation Dependent were both subcategories of the category "Lower Risk". Taxa which were last evaluated prior to 2001 may retain their LR/cd or LR/nt status, although had the category been assigned with the same information today the species would be designated simply "Near Threatened (NT)" in either case.

After SZ verified that the statement did in fact come from the source for the Panama Papers, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) posted the full document on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama Papers: Source breaks silence on Mossack Fonseca leaks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36232142 |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=6 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506162129/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36232142 |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html#_ga=1.164154486.836406132.1459807380 |title=Panama Papers Source Offers Documents To Governments, Hints At More To Come |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |publisher=ICIJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507055440/https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html#_ga=1.164154486.836406132.1459807380 |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SZ asked the ICIJ for help because of the amount of data involved. Journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries analyzed documents detailing the operations of the law firm.&lt;ref name="Guardian: how the rich"/&gt; After more than a year of analysis, the first news stories were published on April 3, 2016, along with 150 of the documents themselves.&lt;ref name="DocumentCloudPP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20(Panama%20Papers)%22 |title=DocumentCloud 150 Results Source: Internal documents from Mossack Fonseca (Panama) |last= |first= |date= |website=DocumentCloud |publisher=Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319113221/https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20%28Panama%20Papers%29%22|archive-date=2017-03-19|dead-url=yes |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project represents an important milestone in the use of [[data journalism]] software tools and [[mobile collaboration]].

The documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from; however, the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name over concerns that it would tarnish the government's and country's image worldwide, as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere. This led to an advertising campaign some weeks after the leak, titled "Panama, more than papers".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Medoro.Madera.Oficial/posts/10153637852624779&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsroompanama.com/news/panama/panama-more-than-papers-us-ambassador&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.panamatoday.com/special-report/panama-papers-scandal-damaged-image-country-4615&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets covering the story have used the name "Mossack Fonseca papers".&lt;ref&gt;Sources using the term "Mossack Fonseca papers":

[[File:Panama papers sz chat.jpg|thumb|A conversation between ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' reporter [[Bastian Obermayer]] and [[anonymous source]] John Doe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html |title=How a Cryptic Message, 'Interested in Data?,' Led to the Panama Papers |last=Clark |first=Nicola |date=2016-04-05 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2017-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112122033/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html |archivedate=January 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In addition to the much-covered business dealings of British prime minister [[David Cameron]] and Icelandic prime minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], the leaked documents also contain identity information about the shareholders and directors of 214,000 shell companies set up by [[Mossack Fonseca]], as well as some of their financial transactions. Much of this information does not show anything more than prudent financial management. It is generally not against the law (in and of itself) to own an offshore shell company, although offshore shell companies may sometimes be used for illegal purposes.

The journalists on the investigative team found business transactions by many important figures in world politics, sports and art. Many of these transactions are quite legal. Since the data is incomplete, questions remain in many other cases; still others seem to clearly indicate ethical if not legal impropriety. Some disclosures – [[tax avoidance]] in very poor countries by very wealthy entities and individuals for example – lead to questions on moral grounds. According to ''[[The Namibian]]'' for instance, a shell company registered to [[Beny Steinmetz]], Octea, owes more than $700,000 US in property taxes to the city of [[Koidu]] in [[Sierra Leone]], and is $150 million in the red, even though its [[export]]s were more than twice that in an average month in the 2012–2015 period. Steinmetz himself has personal worth of $6 billion.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Other offshore shell company transactions described in the documents do seem to have broken exchange laws, violated trade sanctions or stemmed from political corruption, according to ICIJ reporters. For example:

*Uruguay has arrested five people and charged them with [[money-laundering]] through Mossack Fonseca shell companies for a [[Mexican drug cartel]].&lt;ref name=ICIJuru&gt;{{cite news |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160425-cartel-arrests-uruguay.html |title=Cartel-Linked Suspects Arrested After Panama Papers Revelations |author=Martha M.

*''Ouestaf'', an ICIJ partner in the investigation, reported that it had discovered new evidence that [[Karim Wade]] received payments from [[DP World]] (DP). He and a long-time friend were convicted of this in a trial that the [[United Nations]] and [[Amnesty International]] said was unfair and violated the defendants' rights. The ''Ouestaf'' article does not address the conduct of the trial, but does say that ''Ouestaf'' journalists found Mossack Fonseca documents showing payments to Wade via a DP subsidiary and a shell company registered to the friend.&lt;ref name=OuPiste&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ouestaf.com/Panama-papers-et-societes-offshore-sur-la-piste-des-fonds-de-Karim-Wade-Exclusif_a5988.html |title=" Panama papers " et sociétés offshore : sur la piste des fonds de Karim Wade ?

Individuals and entities may open offshore accounts for any number of reasons, some of which are entirely legal&lt;ref name="ABC explainer" /&gt; but ethically questionable.

Using Nuix, ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' reporters performed [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) processing on the millions of scanned documents, making the data they contained become both searchable and machine-readable.

Mossack Fonseca notified its clients on April 1, 2016 that it had sustained an email hack. Mossack Fonseca also told news sources that the company had been hacked and always operated within the law.&lt;ref name="DiePresse.com 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama-Papers: Kanzlei Mossack Fonesca erstattet Anzeige |website=DiePresse.com |date=April 6, 2016 |url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/4961279/PanamaPapers_Kanzlei-Mossack-Fonesca-erstattet-Anzeige |trans-title=Panama-papers: Law firm of Mossack Fonseca charges |language=de |accessdate=2016-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408000710/http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/4961279/PanamaPapers_Kanzlei-Mossack-Fonesca-erstattet-Anzeige |archivedate=April 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data security experts noted, however, that the company had not been encrypting its emails&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; and furthermore seemed to have been running a three-year-old version of [[Drupal]] with several known [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; According to ''[[Tech Republic]]'', Drupal ran on the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] 2.2.15 version from March 6, 2010, and worse, the Oracle [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Apache, which by default allows users to view [[Directory (computing)|directory]] structure.&lt;ref name=TR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/no-1-thing-it-departments-can-learn-from-the-panama-papers-hack/ |title=No. 1 thing IT departments can learn from the Panama Papers hack: Staggeringly out of date software supports the conclusion that documents from Mossack Fonseca were exfiltrated by a hacker.

Over £10&amp;nbsp;million of cash from the sale of the gold stolen in the 1983 [[Brink's-Mat robbery]] was laundered, first unwittingly and later with the complicity of Mossack Fonseca, through a Panamanian company, Feberion Inc. The company was set up on behalf of an unnamed client twelve months after the robbery. The Brinks money was put through Feberion and other [[front company|front companies]], through banks in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Jersey, and the Isle of Man. It issued [[bearer shares]] only.

Leaked documents also indicate that the firm would also backdate documents on request and, based on a 2007 exchange of emails in the leaked documents, it did so routinely enough to establish a price structure: $8.75 per month in the past.&lt;ref name=backdate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-04/unprecedented-leak-of-offshore-financial-records-exposes-secrets/7293524 |title=Panama Papers: Vladimir Putin associates, Jackie Chan identified in unprecedented leak of offshore financial records |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |publisher=ABC News online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417173225/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-04/unprecedented-leak-of-offshore-financial-records-exposes-secrets/7293524 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Mossack Fonseca hired a 90-year-old British man to pretend to be the owner of the offshore company of [[Marianna Olszewski]], a US businesswoman, "a blatant breach of anti-money laundering rules" according to the BBC.&lt;ref name=BBCPanama&gt;{{cite web |last=Bilton |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35956324 |title=Panama Papers: How a British man, 90, covered for a US millionaire |publisher=BBC News |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404082143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35956324 |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctioned clients ===
{{See also|Office of Foreign Assets Control|Due diligence| Know your customer |Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering |Politically exposed person|Economic sanctions |International sanctions}}
The anonymity of offshore shell companies can also be used to circumvent international sanctions, and more than 30 Mossack Fonseca clients were at one time or another blacklisted by the [[US Treasury Department]], including businesses linked to senior figures in Russia, Syria and North Korea.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher "A torrential leak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831141724/https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher |date=August 31, 2017 }}.

Three Mossack Fonseca companies started for clients of Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants were later sanctioned by the US Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC). Pangates International Corporation was accused in July 2014 of supplying the government of Syria with "a large amount of specialty petroleum products" with "limited civilian application in Syria". The other two, Maxima Middle East Trading and Morgan Additives Manufacturing Co, and their owners Wael Abdulkarim and Ahmad Barqawi, were said to have "engaged in deceptive measures" to supply oil products to Syria.&lt;ref name=CBClawyer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |title=Panama Papers: Quebec lawyer based pin Dubai linked to Mossack Fonseca: Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants worked to incorporate 3 companies that now face economic sanctions |author=Salimah Shivji |publisher=CBC News |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422135758/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossack Fonseca also ran six businesses for [[Rami Makhlouf]], cousin of Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]], despite US sanctions against him.&lt;ref name=bbcSyr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |title=Panama Papers: Mossack Fonseca 'helped firms subject to sanctions' |first=Simon |last=Cox |publisher=BBC |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405160118/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Mossack Fonseca documents show that in 2011 Mossack Fonseca rejected a recommendation by their own compliance team to sever ties to Mr. Makhlouf. They agreed to do so only months later. The firm has said it never knowingly allowed anyone connected with rogue regimes to use its companies.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

[[Frederik Obermaier]], co-author of the Panama Papers story and an investigative reporter at the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', told ''[[Democracy Now]]'': "[[Mossack Fonseca]] realised that [[Rami Makhlouf|Makhlouf]] was the cousin, and they realised that he was sanctioned, and they realised that he's allegedly one of the financiers of the Syrian regime. And they said, 'Oh, there is this bank who still does business with him, so we should still keep with him, as well'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: World Leaders from Iceland to Argentina Exposed in Massive Tax Evasion Scheme |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=Democracy Now! |date=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423181546/http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC]] also appeared to reassure [[Mossack Fonseca]] not only that it was "comfortable" with Makhlouf as a client but suggested there could be a rapprochement with the [[Al-Assad family|Assad family]] by the US. Makhlouf is already known to be a long-standing client of HSBC's Swiss private bank, holding at least $15 million with it in multiple accounts in 2006.&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt; The Panamanian files also show HSBC provided financial services to a Makhlouf company called Drex Technologies, which HSBC said was a company of "good standing".&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] in 2013 called DCB Finance a front company for [[Daedong Credit Bank]] and announced sanctions against both companies for providing banking services to North Korean arms dealer [[Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation]],&lt;ref name=USTreas /&gt; attempting to evade sanctions against that country, and helping to sell arms and expand North Korea's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons programme]]. Cowie said the holding company was used for legitimate business and he was not aware of illicit transactions.&lt;ref name=Cowie /&gt;

Mossack Fonseca, required by international banking standards to avoid [[money-laundering]] or fraudster clients, is, like all banks, supposed to be particularly alert for signs of corruption with [[politically exposed person]]s (PEP), in other words, clients who either are or have close ties to government officials. However they somehow failed to turn up any red flags concerning Tareq Abbas even though he shares a family name with the president of Palestine, and sat on the board of directors of a company with four fellow directors the firm did deem PEP because of their ties to Palestinian politics. Yet Mossack Fonseca actually did and documented [[due diligence]] research, including a Google search.&lt;ref name=son /&gt;

==Clients of Mossack Fonseca==
Mossack Fonseca has managed more than 300,000 companies over the years.&lt;ref name="to know" /&gt; The number of active companies peaked at more than 80,000 in 2009. Over 210,000 companies in twenty-one jurisdictions figure in the leaks. More than half were incorporated in the [[British Virgin Islands]], others in Panama, the Bahamas, the Seychelles, [[Niue]], and Samoa. Mossack Fonseca's clients have come from more than 100 countries. Most of the corporate clients were from Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Panama, and Cyprus. Mossack Fonseca worked with more than 14,000 banks, law firms, incorporators, and others to set up companies, foundations, and trusts for their clients.&lt;ref name="ICIJ graphs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/ |title=The Panama Papers Numbers |website=panamapapers.icij.org |access-date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403231300/https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 3,100 companies listed in the database appear to have ties to US offshore specialists, and 3,500 shareholders of offshore companies list US addresses.&lt;ref name=SeattleUS&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Kevin G. |last2=Taylor |first2=Marisa |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/americans-including-a-bellevue-man-show-up-in-panama-papers/ |title=Americans, including a Bellevue man, show up in Panama Papers |work=Seattle Times |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405023526/http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/americans-including-a-bellevue-man-show-up-in-panama-papers/ |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca has offices in Nevada and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=KCStar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article70008302.html |title=US scolds others about offshores, but looks other way at home |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |date=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224021/http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article70008302.html |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm provided services to a Seychelles company named Pangates International, which the US government believes supplied aviation fuel to the Syrian government during the current civil war, and continued to handle its paperwork and certify it as a company in good standing, despite sanctions, until August 2015.&lt;ref name=bbcSyr /&gt;

More than 500 banks registered nearly 15,600 [[shell company|shell companies]] with Mossack Fonseca, with [[HSBC]] and its affiliates accounting for more than 2,300 of the total. [[Dexia]] and [[J.

== Responses by Mossack Fonseca ==
In response to queries from the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and ICIJ, Mossack Fonseca issued a 2,900-word statement listing legal requirements that prevent using offshore companies for [[tax avoidance]] and total anonymity, such as [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]] protocols which require identifying ultimate [[beneficial owner]]s of all companies (including offshore companies) before opening any account or transacting any business.

The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' printed the statement with an editor's note that said the statement "did not address any of the specific due diligence failings uncovered by reporters".&lt;ref name=MH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034835/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archivedate=2016-05-29 |author=Miami Herald staff |title=Mossack Fonseca responds to Miami Herald 'Secret Shell Game' series on offshore companies |date=April 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, April 4, Mossack Fonseca released another statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The facts are these: while we may have been the victim of a data breach, nothing we've seen in this illegally obtained cache of documents suggests we've done anything illegal, and that's very much in keeping with the global reputation we've built over the past 40 years of doing business the right way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Co-founder [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told [[CNN]] that the reports were false, full of inaccuracies and that parties "in many of the circumstances" cited by the ICIJ "are not and have never been clients of Mossack Fonseca". The firm provided longer statements to ICIJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |title=The Panama Papers: 7 things to know |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024845/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its official statement April 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement Regarding Recent Media Coverage |publisher=Mossack Fonseca|access-date=2016-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406213759/http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca suggested that responsibility for any legal violations might lie with other institutions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;approximately 90% of our clientele is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} professional clients&amp;nbsp;... who act as [[financial intermediary|intermediaries]] and are regulated in the [[jurisdiction]] of their business. These clients are obliged to perform [[due diligence]] on their clients in accordance with the [[Know your customer|KYC]] and [[Anti-money laundering|AML regulations]] to which they are subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''Bloomberg'', [[Jürgen Mossack]] said: "The cat's out of the bag, so now we have to deal with the aftermath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |author=Blake Schmidt |publisher=Bloomberg |title=A Conversation With Panama's Suddenly Notorious Offshore Lawyers |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163510/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |archivedate=February 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:00 am on April 3, as the news first broke, [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told television channel [[TVN (Panama)|TVN]] he "was not responsible nor he had been accused in any tribunal".&lt;ref name="tvn-2.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |title=Exclusiva: 'No soy responsable ni he sido acusado en un tribunal', Fonseca Mora |website=TVN |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506225050/http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 8, the government understood media reports were addressing tax evasion not attacking the country of Panama.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The president met on Wednesday April 7, with CANDIF, a committee of representatives from different sectors of the economy which includes the Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Industry and Agriculture, the National Lawyers Association, the International Lawyers Association, the Banking Association and the Stock Exchange, and entered full [[crisis management]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |title=Panama Launches Crisis Talks in Wake of Tax Haven Leaks |website=www.bna.com |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508162514/http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |archivedate=May 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced the creation of a new judiciary tribunal and a high-level commission led by Nobel Prize Laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]].{{when|date=November 2017}}

[[Isabel Saint Malo]] de Alvarado, Vice President of Panama, said in an op-ed piece published April 21 in ''The Guardian'' that President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and his administration have strengthened Panama's controls over [[money-laundering]] in the twenty months they have been in power, and that "Panama is setting up an independent commission, co-chaired by the Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], to evaluate our financial system, determine best practices, and recommend measures to strengthen global financial and legal transparency.

However, in early August 2016, Stiglitz resigned from the committee because he learned that the Panamanian government would not commit to making their final report public.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance of Panama, Dulcidio de la Guardia, formerly an offshore specialist at Mossack Fonseca competitor Morgan &amp; Morgan, said the legal but often "murky" niche of establishing offshore accounts, firms and trusts make up "less than half a percentage point" of Panama's [[GDP]].

The Attorney General's office issued a press release following the raid, which lasted 27 hours,&lt;ref name=Telraid&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/investigators-raid-property-of-panama-papers-law-firm-mossack-fo/ |title=Investigators raid property of 'Panama Papers' law firm Mossack Fonseca |author=Reuters |date=April 23, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423184402/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/investigators-raid-property-of-panama-papers-law-firm-mossack-fo/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the purpose was "to obtain documents relevant to the information published in news articles that establishes the possible use of the law firm in illegal activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/judicial/Registran-Mossack-Fonseca-Panama-Papers-panama-papers-efecto-panama-corrupcion-paraisos-fiscales_0_4459054130.html |title=Fiscalía panameña realizó allanamiento en Mossack Fonseca |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 13, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414193125/http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/judicial/Registran-Mossack-Fonseca-Panama-Papers-panama-papers-efecto-panama-corrupcion-paraisos-fiscales_0_4459054130.html |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search ended without measures against the law firm, confirmed prosecutor Javier Caraballo of the Second Prosecutor Against Organized Crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/evita-referirse-futuro-mossack-fonseca/23933897 |title=MP evita referirse al futuro de Mossack Fonseca |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415111605/http://elsiglo.com/panama/evita-referirse-futuro-mossack-fonseca/23933897 |archivedate=April 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22 the same unit raided another Panama location and "secured a large amount of evidence".&lt;ref name=Telraid /&gt;

The Municipality of Regulation and Supervision of Financial Subjects [not the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)] initiated a special review of the law firm Mossack Fonseca to determine whether it had followed tax law. Carlamara Sanchez, in charge of this proceeding, said at a press conference that the quartermaster had come to verify whether the firm had complied since April 8 with [[due diligence]], customer knowledge, the final beneficiary and reporting of suspicious transactions to Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) operations. She said that Law 23 of 2015 empowers regulation and supervision and said some firms had been monitored since late last year with special attention after the Panama Papers, and noted that the law carries fines $5,000 to $1 million or even suspension of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |title=MEF realiza auditoría a firma Mossack Fonseca |date=April 15, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417003806/http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICIJ investigation of Mossack Fonseca was reported to the Public Ministry. Samid Dan Sandoval, former candidate for mayor of Santiago de Veraguas (2014), filed the legal action against the journalists and all those who had participated. He said the project name damaged the integrity, dignity and sovereignty of the country. and that the consortium would have to assume legal responsibility for all damage caused to the Panamanian nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |title=ICIJ no puede ser investigado |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414104744/http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Change.org petition requested the ICIJ stop using the name of Panama as in the Panama Papers.

=== Suspension of investigation ===
Attorney General of Panama Kenia Isolda Porcell Diaz announced on January 24, 2017 that he was suspending the investigations against Mossack Fonseca because it filed an appeal for protection of constitutional rights before the First Superior Court of Justice of Panama and requested that he deliver all the original documents to issue a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers |first= |last=gestion.pe |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202041325/http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers – laprensalibre.cr |first= |last=www.laprensalibre.cr |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024609/https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |title=Panamá Papers: procuradora general anunció suspensión de investigación |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202025907/http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

==== European Union ====
Many senior EU figures have been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal.&lt;ref name="Politico EU figures"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quentin |first1=Ariès |last2=Paravinci |first2=Giulia |title=5 ways the Panama Papers swept up EU figures |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 7, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224018/http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud|European Commissioner for Taxation]], [[Pierre Moscovici]], has said that the [[European Union]] as a whole had a "duty" to prevent the kind of tax avoidance uncovered in the Panama Papers scandal. Moscovici told reporters the use of offshore companies to hide what he called "shocking amounts" of financial assets from tax authorities was "unethical". He estimated that the tax shelters resulted in an annual loss of some €1&amp;nbsp;trillion in public finances, adding that the [[European Commission]] has attempted to tighten tax rules across the union since November 2014 due to the [[Luxembourg Leaks]] scandal, also revealed by the ICIJ, and that he hoped the extent of the Panama Papers revelations would spur countries to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ariès |first1=Quentin |title=EU vows to act quickly on Panama Papers |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224450/http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 letter, unearthed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to the then president of the [[European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]], the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[David Cameron]] said that offshore trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency requirements as shell companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Cameron stepped in to shield offshore trusts from EU tax crackdown in 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407033153/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: Cameron's 2013 concern over trust reforms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=BBC News |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407000423/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Andorra ====
The Panama Papers revealed that the Minister of Finance of Andorra, [[Jordi Cinca]], while he was CEO of Orfund SA, maintained an offshore company called Mariette Holdings Inc, until its dissolution in 2002 for fear of discovery of his participation in these businesses. The business activities of Orfund had ties to the [[blood diamond]] trade, and the refining and sale of African gold. This company closed shortly before the [[civil war in Ivory Coast]].

The opposition demanded his resignation as a result. In response Cinca said that "if their connection would affect the Government of Andorra, will step down". Still, he did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama "Andorra Difusió]". {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423124656/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama "Andorra Difusió RTVA"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423135858/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 "Portada de El Periòdic d'Andorra"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612081501/http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 |date=June 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html "Europa Press – Orfund"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603170841/http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html |date=June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ "Libertad Digital"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422025514/http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ |date=April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Austria's financial market authority has announced that they will audit two Austrian banks that were mentioned in the Panama Papers – [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisenbank International]] (RBI) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Hypo Vorarlberg|de|3=Vorarlberger Landes- und Hypothekenbank}}. It will be specifically examining whether the banks have complied with their obligation to prevent money laundering.

Former French budget minister [[Jérôme Cahuzac]], who spearheaded a crackdown on tax fraud while in office, was a client of Mossack Fonseca and through them owned a Seychelles company named Cerman Group Limited, incorporated in 2009.

Prime Minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland, had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. But when Sigmundur Davíð took his seat he did not disclose his 50% interest of Wintris, a company that owned bonds of one of the bankrupt banks, nor divest himself of it, until the day before a new law took effect on January 1, 2010 that would have required him to declare this conflict of interest.

A 2012 investigation, by [[Radio Free Europe]] and the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP) discovered that through overseas holding companies, the daughters of Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] owned an interest in a gold mine operation created by a 2006 presidential decree forming a consortium, then awarding it a 30-year lease over environmental and transparency objections in Parliament.&lt;ref name=inv2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |title=Azerbaijan's President Awarded Family Stake in Gold Fields |date=May 3, 2012 |author1=By Khadija Ismayilova |author2=Nushaba Fatullayeva |publisher=OCCRP |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224142/https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |archivedate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Panama Papers made it possible to trace some of the elaborate network of shell companies that manage the ownership of the mines, and in 2016 OCCRP was able to establish that in fact the daughters control the mining operation.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

Aliyev awarded the gold mines to Globex International LLP, Londex Resources S.A., Willy &amp; Meyris S.A. and Fargate Mining Corporation. Thirty percent of the proceeds were allocated to the government of Azerbaijan; 11% of the remaining 70% went to Globex, 45% to Londex, 29% to Willy &amp; Meyris and the remaining 15% to Fargate.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

These companies were registered in Panama, according to the documents obtained from Panama Registry of Companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio RF/RFL, last updated in April 2016 |url=http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |publisher=RFRL |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218194532/http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |archivedate=December 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A one of them, Fargate Mining Corporation was founded by Tagiva Management Ltd., Tagiva Services Ltd. and Verda Management Ltd.

Founder of [[Nobel Oil Group]] also is Mr. N. Hasanov.

The 2012 investigation's reporters, established that Globex was owned through shell companies in Panama, and that these shell companies belonged to the president's daughters and a Swiss businessman whose name appears in other shell companies such as those that manage Azerphone, the family telecommunications monopoly. Villagers told reporters they hoped to work at the mine, which paid $12 a day, and asked them to intervene with the president about the problems the mine was causing with the water supply. They became angry and did not believe the reporters when they said the president's family had a stake in the mine.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

Following the May publication of this report, the National Assembly passed a law making it illegal to report company ownership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |title=Придет ли Азербайджан к открытости? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618114118/http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another giving former presidents and first ladies lifelong legal immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |title=Ильхам Алиев тоже получил пожизненный иммунитет |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616230020/http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |archivedate=June 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khadija Ismayilova, the Radio Free Europe reporter on the 2012 investigation was subjected to escalating legal and public harassment.

Leaked Mossack Fonseca documents made it possible to establish that the daughters also owned Londex, the majority partner in the gold enterprise. It is not entirely clear why they shut the operation down but industry experts familiar with the consortium say it did not seem very experienced and may have rushed into production.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

According to the ICIJ, Aliyev's daughter Arzu not only has financial stakes not only in gold rights but also in Azerfon, the country's largest mobile phone business. She has shares in SW Holding, which "controls nearly every operation related to Azerbaijan Airlines" (Azal), from meals to airport taxis. Both sisters and their brother Heydar own property in Dubai valued at roughly $75&amp;nbsp;million in 2010; Heydar is the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="icij"/&gt;

Some 600 Israeli companies and 850 Israeli shareholders are listed.

Weissglass' name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in May 2012, according to Haaretz, and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a [[Vienna]] bank.

Weissglass and Halkin told Haaretz that the company "was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation... [the] company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |title=600 Israeli companies, 850 shareholders listed in Panama data leak |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405085825/http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict followed months of dramatic news coverage and social media debates, the divisions falling largely along party lines.&lt;ref name="pk" /&gt;

Prior to the ruling, [[Maryam Nawaz]] had tweeted denial of wrongdoing, adding that she did not own "any company/property abroad," except as "a trustee" in a brother's corporation, "which only entitles me to distribute assets to my brother Hussain's family/children if needed."&lt;ref name=SamaaApr416&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam |title=I do not own any company or property abroad: Maryam Nawaz |date=April 4, 2016 |work=[[Samaa TV]] |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024906/http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked documents name her as a [[trustee]] of Nescoll, created in 1993, and Nielson, first registered in 1994. The two companies subscribed to Mossack Fonseca services in July 2006. Mossack Fonseca was managing Nescoll, Nielsen Holdings, and Coomber Group when the three companies obtained a £7 million mortgage from the Swiss bank, [[Deutsche Bank]] (Suisse) SA and purchased four flats in Avenfield House, at 118 [[Park Lane]] in London. Hassan, the other brother, bought Hangon Holdings and its stock in 2007 for £5.5 million; Hangon then bought property, financed through the [[Bank of Scotland]], at 1 Hyde Park Place in London.

Samina Durrani, mother of Shebaz Sharif's second wife, and Ilyas Mehraj, brother of his first, also figure in the documents. Habib Waqas Group/Ilyas Mehraj is listed as a shareholder with 127,735 shares in Haylandale Limited, registered July 24, 2003 in the Bahamas. Mehraj has denied knowing anything about "any company whether incorporated in the Commonwealth of Bahamas or anywhere else under the name: Haylandale Ltd."&lt;ref name=pklist /&gt; Rainbow Limited, the newest of the three offshore companies owned by Samina Durrani, was registered September 29, 2010 in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Armani River Limited, registered in the Bahamas on May 16, 2002, describes its assets as "property in London, which is not currently rented."&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Assets of Star Precision Limited, registered in BVI May 21, 1997, were reported as "cash as the investment portfolio.

=====Benazir Bhutto=====
The late [[Benazir Bhutto]] was also a Mossack Fonseca client. In 2001 the firm set up BVI company Petroline International Inc. for Bhutto, her nephew Hassan Ali Jaffery Bhutto, and her aide and head of security [[Rehman Malik]], who later became a Senator and Interior Minister in the government of [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]. Mossack Fonseca had deemed Bhutto's first company, the similarly named Petrofine FZC, politically sensitive and "declined to accept Mrs Bhutto as a client."&lt;ref name=MFBhutto&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |title=In oil-for-food shadow, Benazir Bhutto set up a firm too |author=Jay Mazoomdaar |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |publisher=Indian Express |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416230235/http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations]] committee chaired by former US [[Federal Reserve]] head [[Paul Volcker]] had determined in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|oil-for-food]] program that Petrofine FZC paid US$2 million to the [[Iraq]]i government of [[Saddam Hussein]] to obtain US $115–145 million in oil contracts.&lt;ref name=OfF&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |title=Panama Papers: Benazir Bhutto's oil firm paid huge bribes to Iraqi President Saddam Hussain for contracts |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=Ali Zain |publisher=Daily Pakistan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419125238/http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Pakistani [[National Accountability Bureau]] (NAB) accused Bhutto, Malik and Ali Jaffery of owning Petrofine, established since 2000 in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Bhutto and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] denied it. In April 2006 an NAB court froze assets owned in Pakistan and elsewhere by Bhutto and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]], saying that the assets, totaling $1.5 billion, were the result of corrupt practices, and that Swiss charges of criminal money laundering filed in 1997 were still in litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redcatsboards.yuku.com/topic/16603/Court-orders-confiscation-of-Zardaris-entire-property#.VxQPh_gXAlK |title=Court orders confiscation of Zardari's entire property |date=2 April 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=khaleejtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]], prime minister from 2007 to 2013, in 2002 acquired three shell companies incorporated in the Bahamas and another in the British Virgin Islands and through them moorage in [[Mallorca]] and a $300 million yacht named ''Al Mirqab''.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |title=Panama Papers Leak Helps Show That Qatar's Former Prime Minister Is A Billionaire |author=Chloe Sorvino |publisher=''Forbes'' |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420180845/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panama Papers indicate he owns or owned eight shell companies. Subsequent reporting by ''Forbes'' found that Al Thani bought $700 million in [[Deutsche Bank]] shares in 2014 through Paramount Services Holdings and in 2015 transferred roughly half the stock to Supreme Universal Holdings, owned by a relative who had left office as emir of Qatar, also in 2013.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar /&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
[[File:Salman bin Abdull aziz December 9, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]] ]]

[[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] is mentioned in the leaks in relation to two companies based in the British Virgin Islands—Verse Development Corporation, incorporated in 1999, and Inrow Corporation, incorporated in 2002. The companies took out mortgages totaling over US$34&amp;nbsp;million and purchased properties in central London.&lt;ref name=SalonClinton&gt;{{cite news |title=With Saudi and Russian ties, Clinton machine's tentacles are far reaching, according to Panama Papers |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=8 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502005935/http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the companies was not specified.

The vessel boasts a banquet hall and can comfortably sleep 30.&lt;ref name=Velite /&gt; King Salman is described in the documents as its "principal user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi King, UAE President at the Center of the Panama Papers |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |newspaper=[[TeleSUR]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024709/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Irish Times'' found a link to Iran-Contra in the Panama Papers, in the persons of one of America’s most colourful political donors Farhad Azima and multi-billionaire [[Adnan Khashoggi]], who both employed Mossack Fonseca’s services, and were both important figures in [[Iran-Contra]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/business/panama-papers-links-revealed-to-spies-and-iran-contra-affair-1.2599083&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mossack Fonseca files show Khashoggi appeared as early as 1978, when he became president of the Panamanian company ISIS Overseas S.A. The documents reveal that Fonseca’s clients included Sheikh [[Kamal Adham]], Saudi Arabia’s first intelligence chief (1963-79), brother-in-law of King Faisal, who was named by a US Senate committee as the CIA’s “principal liaison for the entire the Middle East from the mid-1960s through 1979”. Adham controlled offshore companies involved in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|B.C.C.I.]] banking sem as instruments for their official worcandal.&lt;ref name="goldf"&gt;Will Fitzgibbon and Nicolas Richter: [https://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/570e6affa1bb8d3c3495baf4 Panama Papers: CIA-Agents used companies from Panama] Operation Goldfinger, [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sri Lankan Finance Minister [[Ravi Karunanayake]] said his panel will investigate Sri Lankan names that come up in the Panama Papers, as well as the 46 who appear in the 2013 Offshore Leaks, according to the ''Daily Mail'', since earlier leadership apparently did not do so. The country has many large outstanding foreign loans taken out under the administration of former president [[Mahinda Rajapakse]], and the current government recently had to obtain a US$1.5 billion [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout. Rajapakse has denied diverting funds. The current government came to power in January 2016 on an anti-corruption platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka sets up panel to investigate 'Panama Papers' |date=May 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |author=AFP |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160726040317/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |archivedate=July 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria ====
[[Rami Makhlouf]], a maternal cousin of [[Bashar Al-Assad]], was worth an estimated $5 billion before the [[Syrian Civil War]], and had control of 60% of the economy.

==== Thailand ====
The ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' reported that the "[[Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand)|Anti-Money Laundering Office]] (AMLO) is seeking information from its foreign counterparts regarding twenty-one Thai nationals reportedly included in a list of people worldwide using a Panama-based law firm apparently specializing in money laundering and tax evasion." It is not clear why AMLO is investigating only twenty-one. The Panama Papers include at least 780 names of individuals based in Thailand and another 50 companies based in Thailand. Some are foreigners or foreign-owned companies, but 634 individual addresses in Thailand appear in the documents that have surfaced to date, including the CEOs of giant companies [[Bangkok Land]] and Phatra Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/920929/many-thais-implicated-in-global-scandal |title='Many' Thais implicated in global scandal |work=Bangkok Post |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations by ICIJ's sole [[East Asian]] partner ''CommonWealth Magazine'' in [[Taiwan]] found that at least 2,725 offshore companies had registered addresses in Taiwan.

The publisher concludes that: "Taiwanese companies and individuals are believed to be extensively using offshore shelters to avoid or evade taxes ... after scouring the Panama Papers documents that Mossack Fonseca has not been one of their main conduits. This time, it appears that big Taiwanese banks, law firms and accounting firms did not often use the services of Mossack Fonseca, which does not have a presence in Taiwan. The forty-six Taiwanese brokers that did work with Mossack Fonseca were relatively small-scale consulting firms operating in Greater China. Most of the Taiwanese entities that set up shell companies through the Panamanian law firm were small, unlisted companies or individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |title=CommonWealth Magazine |publisher=English.cw.com.tw |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531210910/http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |archivedate=May 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costa Rica ====
The administration of President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] suggested that some of the activity unveiled by the leaked documents suggests attempts to [[tax evasion|evade taxes]]. His administration's effort to implement tax increases and reforms has met strong resistance from opposition and business figures.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |title=Costa Rica in the Panama Papers leak |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233246/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents suggest that Mossack Fonseca helped tuna export company Borda Azul set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in order to avoid Costa Rican taxes. The firm, now out of business, was headed by Hermes Navarro, president of the [[Costa Rican Football Federation]] from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt; In the late 1990s the Finance Ministry and Prosecutor's Office investigated Borda Azul and other export companies for allegedly misusing tax credit certificates; in 1997 dozens of companies had been accused of using the certificates for fraud and to launder drug profits.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

According to ICIJ investigative partners DataBaseAR and Seminario Universidad, Mossack Fonseca helped Borda Azul fabricate invoices to allow it to report both inflated costs—to reduce its taxes—and inflated exports, to allow it to continue to qualify for the tax credit certificates. In a letter dated October 19, 1998, a Mossack Fonseca lawyer explained the investigation to the Panama City office and concluded:

{{Quote|In the worst of circumstances, being very fatalistic, the Costa Rican government could, after years of investigation, suspend the transfer of CATs to Borda Azul for irregularities but never send anyone to jail. |source=a Mossack Fonseca lawyer&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;}}

More than thirty Costa Rican law firms are mentioned in the Panama Papers as referring clients to Mossack Fonseca, resulting in the creation of more than 360 shell companies. in particular Gonzalo Fajardo &amp; Asociados, founded by former Finance Ministry official and later Economy Minister Gonzalo Fajardo Salas, and over nearly two decades helped Costa Rican companies set up 82 offshore corporations in tax havens, according to DataBaseAR.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

Finance Vice Minister Fernando Rodríguez said Costa Rica will push to sign a [[Tax Information Exchange Agreement]] with Panama.&lt;ref name=TTleg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |title=Panama Papers scandal cracks open window for Costa Rica tax reform |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |author=L.Arias |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233200/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators from several parties are trying to line up political consensus to seek approval of the administration's tax fraud bill and to form a legislative commission to investigate those named in the Panama Papers, according to [[Emilia Molina Cruz]] of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]].&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt; While opposition parties have maintained that the country's financial problems stem from excess spending, according to the Finance Department, the sums Costa Rica loses to tax evasion equal about 8% of the country's gross domestic product, while its deficits have run at about 6%.&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt;

===== Panama Free Trade Agreement =====

The [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Panama Free Trade Agreement]],&lt;!-- Majority of sources use phrase "Panama Free Trade Agreement --&gt; supported by Obama and Clinton, has been accused of enabling the practices detailed within the Panama Papers through regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mindock |first1=Clark |title=Panama Papers: Obama, Clinton Pushed Trade Deal Amid Warnings It Would Make Money Laundering, Tax Evasion Worse |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |work=International Business Times |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425114027/http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Obama administration official said the argument has "zero merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mauldin |first1=William |last2=Viswanatha |first2=Aruna |title=Sanders Says U.S. Helped Panama as a Tax Haven But Skips Over Tax Pact |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |accessdate=April 24, 2016 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423161258/http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cassidy of ''[[The New Yorker]],'' said the Panama Free Trade Agreement actually forced Panama to release information to the American regulatory authorities on "the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, and other persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |title=Panama Papers: Why Aren't There More American Names? |last=Cassidy |first=John |date=April 5, 2016 |newspaper=The New Yorker |issn=0028-792X |access-date=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424061651/http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- deleting eoin higgins again, no evidence he is anything other than some dude with an MA that isn't even in business, and I looked pretty hard.

Citing leaked diplomatic cables, ''Fortune'' writer Chris Matthews speculated that Obama and Clinton may have supported the agreement, after opposing it while campaigning for office, because it was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for Panamanian support of US efforts against drug trafficking. In any event, he notes, while it is true that the agreement abolished limits on fund transfers between the US and Panama, the Obama administration insisted that the two countries first sign a [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information and Exchange Agreement]] as well, which facilitated the exchange of tax information between the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |title=Panama Papers: Why Did Clinton and Obama Flip Flop on Trade with Panama |first=Chris |last=Matthews |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423073913/http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== After the leak =====

President Barack Obama addressed the overseas shell companies listed by the leak in a press conference: "It's not that they're breaking the laws," he said, "it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boland-Rudder |first1=Hamish |last2=Holmes |first2=Allan |last3=Chittum |first3=Ryan |title=Impact of Panama Papers rockets around the world; U.S. officials react cautiously |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034506/https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archivedate=2016-05-29 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=Center for Public Integrity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no leader in the US was mentioned in the Panama Papers, Obama said that "Frankly, folks in America are taking advantage of the same stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Revesz |first1=Rachael |title=Obama says Americans are doing the same Panama Papers tax avoidance as everyone else |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=The Independent |date=April 5, 2016 |location=New York, United States |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225248/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McClatchy Newspapers]] initially found four Americans with offshore shell companies named in the documents.

* Shell companies can be created in the United States.
* Major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands instead.
* US laws like the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) and the [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information Exchange Agreements]] (TIEAs) of 2010 have meant that the "tax evasion game [was] principally over for American taxpayers".

===== Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner =====
Daniel Muñoz, the private secretary and confidant of former Argentinian president [[Néstor Kirchner]] later also served for two years as an aide to Néstor Kirchner's wife, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], who was president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Muñoz and his wife were linked to Gold Black Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2010 to invest in US real estate. The origin of the company's funds was listed as "personal savings". From 2010 to the beginning of 2015, the company's ownership was through bearer shares, a financial instrument that can be used to hide an owner's identity. One of the directors, Sergio Tadisco, told ICIJ partner Canal Trece that he was just a figurehead who said he agreed to his name being used in 2011 because of his friendship with Muñoz and his wife. In January 2015, Muñoz and his wife became named shareholders, owning 50 percent each. By that time, Mossack Fonseca had become the registered agent of Gold Black. However, only three weeks later, its compliance department proposed resigning because Muñoz was identified in connection with the governments of the Kirchners. The resignation became effective in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|title=The Power Players|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404030817/https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|archivedate=April 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|title=Quién es Daniel Muñoz, el "valijero" de Kirchner {{!}} Revista Noticias|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907160557/http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|archivedate=September 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|title=Panama Papers: los Kirchner se desvincularon de la investigación sobre sociedades offshore|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002073628/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|archivedate=October 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Muñoz was investigated for illicit enrichment, a charge that was later dropped. In 2013, Argentinian media reported that Muñoz had helped transfer "bags of money" belonging to President Néstor Kirchner from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, to Santa Cruz, the Kirchner's home state. Charges in relation to the matter were dismissed in July 2015 for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |title=Un piloto confirmó los vuelos con dinero del secretario de Kirchner |last=Clarin.com |website=www.clarin.com |language=es |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012202312/https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |archivedate=October 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2016 he died from a cancer that he had for the last four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |title=Murió Daniel Muñoz, señalado como 'valijero' de Kirchner |work=Urgente24 |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013014101/https://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |archivedate=October 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
Five billionaires from Brazil, the sons of two Brazilian billionaires, and four former billionaire Brazilian families appear in the Panama Papers leak, according to [[Forbes]]. The Brazilian news website [[Universo Online|UOL]] has access to the leaked documents and has published an article and a list. Like many Panama Paper reports, their story cautions that some of the people mentioned in the documents may be doing nothing wrong: "In general there is nothing illegal per se in having an offshore company and in fact it is very common for an international business to set one up for transactions and joint ventures when they're doing business all over the world," said Brazil-based Marcello Hallake, a Brazil-based partner of the law firm [[Jones Day]].&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |title=Billionaires From Brazil And Mexico Named In The Panama Papers Leak |date=14 April 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Kerry Dolan |publisher=Forbes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422155920/http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three men ([[Marcel Herrmann Telles]], [[Carlos Alberto Sicupira]] and Jorge Felipe Lemann, son of their long-time business partner [[Jorge Paulo Lemann]], Brazil's richest man and a controlling shareholder of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]) set up three offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas tied to private equity firm [[3G]] and to beer firm Ambev, a unit of Anheuser-Busch Inbev, according to UOL. Two of the companies are no longer active and the men are no longer tied with the third. They told UOL the companies had been publicly disclosed and registered.

Police raided the [[São Paulo]] offices of Mossack Fonseca in January 2016, seeking records about offshore companies the firm opened for two former executives of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. ([[Petrobras]]) who were convicted in 2015 of corruption and money laundering. Police say the companies were used to hide illegally diverted funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |title=Panama Leak Involves Firm Probed in Petrobras Scandal — Energy Journal |author=Christopher Harder |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412041544/http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |archivedate=April 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Operation Car Wash =====
In January 2016, even before the Panama Papers were published, the Brazilian Federal Police, as part of a corruption investigation known as [[Operation Car Wash]], had already accused Mossack Fonseca's law firm of helping suspects create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. They alleged that the firm used a real estate company to help hide criminal proceeds from the scheme involving [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blankfeld |first1=Karen |title=Law Firm At Center of Panama Papers Leak Was Implicated In Brazil Corruption Scandal In January |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018055159/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |archivedate=October 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Impeachment ======
The leak complicated an already volatile political situation in Brazil, where a tanking economy had led to calls for the impeachment of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] amid many revelations of political corruption. As impeachment proceedings began, it became clear that the next two people in the order of succession have been implicated in the [[Petrobras]] scandal. According to ''[[O Estado de São Paulo]]'', a company belonging to [[Eduardo Cunha]], speaker of the lower house of the legislature and a leader of the impeachment drive, has surfaced in the Panama Papers.&lt;ref name=TTLatin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |title=Officials in Latin America linked to 'Panama Papers' |author=AFP |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233311/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseff herself is not mentioned in the papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |title=Dilma Rousseff, President of Brazil, Resists Calls for Her Resignation |publisher=New York Times |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Simon Romero |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416010838/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians from seven different political parties in Brazil were named as clients of Mossack Fonseca. Leaked files mention politicians from Brazil's largest party, the [[PMDB]], which broke away from President [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s coalition in 2016. Political figures from the [[PSDB]], the most prominent opposition party in the country, were also mentioned in the leaks, as well as others from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|PDT]], PP, PSB, PSD and the PTB parties. No politicians from [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Rousseff's party]] were mentioned in the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cascione |first1=Silvio |last2=Simon |first2=W |title=Brazil politicians linked to offshore companies in Panama leaks: paper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419084505/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Dutch journalists from the daily newspaper ''[[Trouw]]'' found evidence in the Panama Papers showing that [[TV Globo]] is cited "many times" in a money laundering investigation of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank]] which revealed that for years the media outlet conducted "irregular financial transactions" through tax havens in order to pay for broadcast rights for the [[Copa Libertadores]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html Brazilian Media Giant Globo Implicated in the Panama Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410094618/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html |date=April 10, 2016 }} by teleSUR (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice the requirement is widely ignored, and an investigation by African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) found examples in the leaked Mossack Fonseca documents of anonymous shell companies doing the sourcing. For a start, most of the DRC gold winds up in Dubai by way of Uganda. Dubai's $75 billion gold industry is regulated with a very light hand by the quasi-private [[Dubai Multi Commodities Centre]] (DMCC).&lt;ref name="Dgold" /&gt;

Citp was managed by Kane, a close friend of the president's chief of staff, Maixent Accrombessi, himself held in Paris and interrogated in August 2015. French officials wanted to ask Accrombessi about a contract between Marck and the Gabonese Ministry of the Interior for €7 million. The head of Marck, Philippe Belin, was also held and questioned.

[[File:Karim Wade.jpg|thumb|upright|Senegalese politician [[Karim Wade]] ]]
&lt;!-- this material draws heavily on the exclusive reporting of the French-language online news site Ouestaf as part of the year-long investigation of journalists world-wide into the data contained in the Panama Papers --&gt;
ICIJ partner Ouestaf.com was able to establish through the Panama Papers the existence of secret contracts between and [[DP World]] FZE (DP)and Mamadou Pouye, the [[bribery]] codefendant of [[Karim Wade]], son of former prime minister [[Abdoulaye Wade]]. This information was not available at their trial; Ouestaf confirmed their financial ties to the corporation for the first time during the Panama Papers investigation.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; &lt;!-- this material from Karim Wade article on French wikipedia start --&gt; Wade was sentenced in 2015 to a six-year prison term by the Cour de répression de l'enrichissement illicite (Crei), a specialized anti-corruption court.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Wade was accused of illegally amassing assets of more than $240 million; and his childhood friend Pouye was sentenced to five years for allegedly helping him.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Both denied wrongdoing and the United Nations and Amnesty International said their rights had been violated at trial.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Karim Wade And Mamadou Pouye Named In The Panama Papers Scandal! |url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409095013/http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal/ |archivedate=April 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouestaf's investigation did not address the legality of their trial. It did conclude that they had succeeded in tracing a payment to Pouye's oversea shell company from a subsidiary of DP.

Wade remains a member of the [[Senegalese Democratic Party]] (PDS) and is still the PDS candidate for the 2017 presidential election.&lt;!-- this material from Karim wade article on French wikipedia stop --&gt;

Mossack Fonseca documents show that Pouye owned three offshore companies, Seabury Inc, Regory Invest and Latvae Inc.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

* Through Seabury, a consulting contract worth €7.2 million with [[DP World]] materialized.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;
* A second contract for 2013–2015 was to focus on DP's African holdings, and would have paid Wade and Puye $3 million at signing;&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; however the pair were arrested.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

Seabury seems to have been set up solely for doing business with DP World. It was started in 2008, a year after Senegal signed a contract with DP World for rights to the container terminal at the [[Autonomous Port of Dakar]].&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; In April 2009 Wade became minister of international cooperation, of territorial development, air transport and infrastructure, which he remained until his father's defeat by [[Macky Sall]] in the 2012 election.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; Regory Invest acted as a Seabury subcontractor, receiving €65,000 euros a month, according to the documents.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

According to ''Ouestaf'' the documents make it clear that while Crei investigators were interested in the funds in Pouye's Monaco account, they did not know that their source was an offshore account he created himself.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; The two contracts prove that there was in fact a relationship between the defendants and [[DP World]]. Investigator Papa Alboury Ndao told the court in February{{when|date=May 2016}} that he had discovered two payments of $13 million each from a subsidiary of DP World FZE to a Singapore bank account belonging to Karim Wade. However the bank in Singapore refused to cooperate and Ndao was forced to drop that line of inquiry.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

===== Others =====
Mossack Fonseca opened several offshore companies for multinationals. For example: Anglogold, owner of Anglogold Investments Senegal Ltd et Anglogold Exploration Senegal Ltd (both based in the British Virgin Islands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529033915/https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archivedate=2016-05-29 |title=et sociétés offshore : sur la piste des fonds de Karim Wade? |author=ANCIR |work=#Panama Papers |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
{{See also|Mining in Sierra Leone|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306}}
The ICIJ investigation traces out many levels of offshore holdings in multiple countries related to the business dealings of [[Beny Steinmetz]], with many serious findings such as a request that Mossack Fonseca backdate the revocation of a power of attorney.&lt;ref name=NamStein&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |title=Sierra Leone's flawed diamond trade |author1=Khadija Sharife |author2=Silas Gbandia |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510111253/http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca records show that Sierra Leone diamond exporter Octea, based in the British Virgin Islands with the Steinmetz family as its beneficiaries, is wholly owned by Guernsey-based BSGR Resources, linked to a bribery scandal in Guinea. Foundations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, among them Nysco and Balda, own BSGR. In 2007, one of Nysco's bank accounts contained $27.7 million.

Steinmetz, who has a personal fortune of $6 billion, supplies diamonds to [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] and [[DeBeers]] and is Sierra Leone's largest private investor. Yet, according to a detailed report in ''The Namibian'', his Octea subsidiary owes, among other debts, property taxes of $700,000 to the city of [[Koidu]]. These unpaid taxes are discounted, according to mayor [[Saa Emerson Lamina]], because Octea promised a 5% profit−sharing agreement, and payment 1% of its annual profit to a community development fund, but it did not do this either.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Octea's subsidiary, Koidu Holdings, obtained the mine for $28 million, which was supposed to be a deposit, in 2002. Fighting had stopped in Sierra Leone, and the mine had previously been held and worked by South African firm Branch Energy, in payment for the services of its parent company, [[Executive Outcomes]], "effectively...a military battalion for hire,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |title=Diamond Hunters Fuel Africa's Brutal Wars |author=James Rupert |date=October 16, 1999 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510210155/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; against rebel fighters in the area. Steinmetz has since put $300 million into the project.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt;

According to reporting by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the company produces 60–90% of Sierra Leone's diamond exports, and in some months between 2012 and 2015 exported more than US$330 million in rough diamonds.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Octea owes US$150 million in unpaid loans.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Although government records show taxes paid by other diamond companies, none are listed for Octea.

The National Mineral Agency (NMA) until 2005 valued diamonds for export using a price book based on 1996 figures. Companies also often seek to minimize the value of their diamond exports to reduce taxes and move profits abroad. Once transferred to a subsidiary elsewhere where their value is not taxed, the same diamonds are frequently worth more.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Diamonds from Koidu average $330 a carat, roughly 50% more than De Beers's Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the world's biggest. Tiffany has first pick of some of the best stones mined at Koidu and the remainder are sold to other trade buyers, according to ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |title=Was Billionaire Steinmetz Betrayed by CEO Over Diamond Mine? |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |date=November 11, 2016 |author1=Thomas Biesheuvel |author2=Jesse Riseborough |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411202637/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |archivedate=April 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2016, Australia said it would create a public register showing the beneficial, or actual, owners of shell companies, as part of an effort to stamp out tax avoidance by multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |title=Australia to create public register of shell company owners, in wake of Panama Papers |publisher=South China Morning Post |date=April 22, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423193649/http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents examined by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] "pierced the veil of anonymous shell companies" and linked a Sydney businessman and a Brisbane geologist to mining deals in North Korea.&lt;ref name=ABCkor&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |title=Panama papers reveal evidence Australians are involved in deals with North Korea that could be in breach of sanctions |author1=Mark Willacy |author2=Lisa Main |author3=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=7.30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511224134/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rather than applying sanctions, the Australian Government and the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]] seem to have allowed a coach and horses to be ridden through them by the people involved in forming this relationship, corporate relationship with one of the primary arms manufacturers in North Korea," said Thomas Clark of the [[University of Technology Sydney]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

David Sutton was director of AAT Corporation and EHG Corporation when they held mineral licenses in North Korea and did business with Korean Natural Resources Development and Investment Corporation, which is under [[United Nations]] sanctions, and North Korea's "primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, responsible for approximately half of the arms exported by North Korea."&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; The geologist, Louis Schurmann, said British billionaire [[Kevin Leech]] was key to putting the deal together.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; Leaked documents also reveal the involvement of another Briton, Gibraltar-based John Lister.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; According to ABC, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] was aware of these mining deals, which had also been brought up in the [[Australian Senate]], but nobody ever referred the matter to the [[Australian Federal Police]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

On May 12, 2016, the names of former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and former [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Neville Wran]], were both found in the Panama Papers, due to the pair's former directorship of the Mossack Fonseca-incorporated company ''Star Technology Systems Limited''. Turnbull and Wran resigned from these positions in 1995, and the Prime Minister has denied any impropriety, stating "had [Star Technology] made any profits—which it did not regrettably—it certainly would have paid [[Taxation in Australia|tax in Australia]]."&lt;ref name="ABC Turnbull"&gt;{{cite web |title=Malcolm Turnbull denies any wrongdoing after being listed in Panama Papers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |accessdate=May 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512104823/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |archivedate=May 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
Media initially reported that the Panama Papers lists 500 entities created under the jurisdiction of the Cook Islands, population 10,000, almost as many as Singapore, whose population is 5.7 million.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt; After the [[Winebox Inquiry|Winebox affair]], the Cook Islands gave New Zealand jurisdiction over tax matters.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Panama Papers whistleblower cites Pacific isles, NZ, for good reasons |author=Simon Louisson |work=The Standard |url=http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |date=May 8, 2016 |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510031659/http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
New Zealand's [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] said that they were working to obtain details of people who have [[tax residence]] in the country who may have been involved in arrangements facilitated by Mossack Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |title=Tax authorities begin probes into some people named in Panama Papers leak |date=April 4, 2016 |first1=Jane |last1=Wardell |first2=Elida |last2=Moreno |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404020808/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gerard Ryle]], director of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], told Radio New Zealand on April 8, 2016 that New Zealand is a well-known tax haven and a "nice front for criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/78694086/nz-a-nice-front-for-criminals-panama-papers-journalist |title=NZ a 'nice front' for criminals |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand provides overseas investors with foreign trusts and [[Look-through company|look-through companies]]. New Zealand government policy is to not request disclosure of the identity of either the settlor or the beneficiaries of the trust, and thus the ownership remains secret, and as a consequence, thus hiding the assets from the trust-holder's home jurisdictions. These trusts are not taxed in New Zealand. These trusts can then be used to acquire and own New Zealand registered companies, which become a vehicle by which the trust owners can exercise day to day control over their assets. These New Zealand-registered companies can be designed not to make a profit using loans from tax havens and other profit shifting techniques: the result being tax free income with the general respectability that has typically been associated with companies registered in New Zealand.

Prime Minister [[John Key]] responded May 7 to [[John Doe (Panama Papers' whistleblower)|John Doe]]'s remark that he had been "curiously quiet" about tax evasion in the [[Cook Islands]] by saying that the whistleblower was confused and probably European. While the Cook Islands use New Zealand currency, "I have as much responsibility for tax in the Cook Islands as I do for taxing Russia." New Zealand does represent the Cook Islands on defence and foreign policy, but not taxation, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/79731038/panama-papers-whistleblower-calls-out-john-key-over-silence-on-fraud-mecca |title=Panama Papers whistleblower confused – John Key |author1=Tracy Watkins |author2=Ellen Read |author3=Simon Maude |date=May 7, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In distancing New Zealand from the Cook Islands, Key ignored the close ties between the two countries and the crucial role New Zealand had in setting up the Cook Island taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/8515361/Money-trail-leads-home-to-New-Zealand |title=Money trail leads home to New Zealand |work=Stuff |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Niue ====
Mossack Fonseca approached [[Niue]] in 1996 and offered to help set up a tax haven on the tiny South Sea island. The law firm drafted the necessary legislation, permitting offshore companies to operate in total secrecy. They took care of all the paperwork, the island got a modest fee for each filing, and it seemed like quite a deal, even if they were required by law now to provide all banking paperwork in Russian and Chinese as well as English.&lt;ref name=DBNiue&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |title=Polynesian 'Rock' That Made Millions From Panama Papers' Crooks: How Niue, a coral outcropping with just 1,190 residents, rolled out the welcome mat for Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the center of the massive records leak—and made a tidy profit |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2016 |author=Michael Daly |work=Daily Beast |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502191518/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon the filings almost covered the island's year budget. The US government however made official noises in 2001 about laundering criminal proceeds and [[Chase Bank]] blacklisted the island and [[Bank of New York]] followed suit. This caused inconvenience to the population so they let their contract with Mossack Fonseca expire and many of the privacy-seekers on the banking world moved on.&lt;ref name=DBNiue /&gt; Some did stay however, apparently; the Panama Papers database lists nearly 10,000 companies and trusts set up on Niue, population 1200.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt;

==== Samoa ====
Many recently created shell companies were set up in Samoa, perhaps after Niue revised its tax laws. The Panama Papers database lists more than 13,000 companies and trusts set up there. Samoa has a population of roughly 200,000.&lt;ref name=APNZ&gt;

== FIFA investigation ==
On May 27, 2015, the US Department of Justice indicted a number of companies and individuals for conspiracy, corruption and racketeering in connection with bribes and kickbacks paid to obtain media and marketing rights for FIFA tournaments. Some immediately entered guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417221705/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those indicted were [[Jeffrey Webb]] and [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], the current and former presidents of [[CONCACAF]], the continental confederation under FIFA headquartered in the United States. They were charged with racketeering and bribery offenses. Others were US and South American sports marketing executives who paid and agreed to pay well over $150 million in bribes and kickbacks.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

On December 12, 2014, [[José Hawilla]], the owner and founder of the [[Traffic Group]], the Brazilian sports marketing conglomerate, waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a four-count information charging him with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Hawilla also agreed to forfeit over $151 million, $25 million of which was paid at the time of his plea.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

Adapted from Patten and Kelly (2010)&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;]]
A '''perceptual trap''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] scenario in which [[environmental change]], typically [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], leads an organism to avoid an otherwise high-quality [[habitat]]. The concept is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.

==History==
In a 2004 article discussing [[source-sink dynamics]], James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both "sources."&lt;ref name=Battin&gt;Battin, J. (2004) [http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf "When good animals love bad habitats: ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813074823/http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (PDF), ''Conservation Biology,'' '''18''': 1482–1491&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenonmenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland,&lt;ref name=Gilroy&gt;Gilroy, J. J., and W. J. Sutherland. (2007) "Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources," ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution,'' '''22''': 351–356&lt;/ref&gt; who described them as "undervalued resources." The term "perceptual trap" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article.&lt;ref name=Patten&gt;Patten, M.A., and Kelly, J.F. (2010) "Habitat selection and the perceptual trap," ''Ecological Applications,'' '''20''': 2148–2156.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Van Dyck&lt;ref name=VanDyck&gt;Van Dyck, H. (2012) "Changing organisms in rapidly changing anthropogenic landscapes: the significance of the ‘Umwelt’-concept and functional habitat for animal conservation," ''Evolutionary Applications,'' '''5(2)''': : 144–153.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping.

==Description==
Animals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat.&lt;ref name=Kristan&gt;Kristan, W. B. (2003) "The role of habitat selection behavior in population dynamics: source–sink systems and ecological
traps," ''Oikos,'' '''103''': 457–468&lt;/ref&gt; A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; There is expected to be strong [[natural selection]] against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as [[Allee effect]]s may restrict a population’s ability to establish itself.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Lesser Prairie Chicken.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; propose that a perceptual trap is acting on populations of the [[lesser prairie chicken]]]]
To support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; cited a study of the [[lesser prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus pallidicinctus''). The species' natural environment, [[shinnery oak]] [[grassland]], is often treated with the [[herbicide]] [[tebuthiuron]] to increase grass cover for [[grazing|cattle grazing]].&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in  herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and [[clutch size]]s to those in untreated areas.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the [[spotted towhee]] (''Pipilo maculatus'') and [[rufous-crowned sparrow]] (''Aimophila ruficeps''), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in [[snake]] predation.&lt;ref name=Patten2&gt;Patten, M. A., and D. T. Bolger (2003) "Variation in top-down control of avian reproductive success across a fragmentation gradient", ''Oikos,'' '''101''':479–488&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary perspective==
An [[evolution]]ary perspective, based primarily on the evolutionary process of [[natural selection]], has been proposed to explain variations in human personality and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rv_tCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=natural+selection+developed+individuality+personality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-5kYpIG2yU&amp;sig=v2q4lDsPpxgr4P9UWjIpnyTDPAs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis4vCtoY3UAhWKrY8KHbagA_QQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=natural%20selection%20developed%20individuality%20personality&amp;f=false|title=Foundations of Personality|first1=P.J.|last1=Hettema|first2=Ian J.|last2=Deary|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=7|isbn=978-94-011-1660-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, evolution introduced variations of the human mind and natural selection acted on these by choosing which were the most beneficial and which led to a greater fitness. Due to human complexity, many opposing personality traits proved to be beneficial in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/american%20psychologist.pdf|title=The Evolution of Personality Variation in Humans and Other Animals|journal=European Journal of Personality|date=August 2007|first1=Lars|last1=Penke|first2=Jaap J. A.|last2=Denissen|first3=Geoffrey F.|last3=Miller|volume=21|issue=5|pages=549–587|issn=0890-2070|doi=10.1002/per.629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary perspective traces personality and individuality back to when the early humans were learning how to function in complex social groups. Many specialists from different fields have a general agreement that early humans saw themselves as a part of the group to which they belonged, rather than seeing themselves as individuals with independent personalities. In terms of personality at this time, the whole group was identical.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, M. G. (2010, January 1). Consciousness: The Evolution Of The Self And Personal Individuality. Retrieved November 1, 2014, from
www.agenthuman.com/product/evolution_self_personal_individuality.html#selfevol&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the group associated themselves as one with the tribe and therefore the responsibility rested in the group and not the individual. Kropotkin explained the importance of this by stating that because the primitive man identified his existence with the existence of his tribe it has allowed for mankind to reach the remarkable level present today. A small step of differentiation that later led to personality and individuality was the division of labor. This differentiation was necessary in order for the group to function in a much more efficient way. This differentiation became adaptive since it increased the groups functionality. These early humans then continued to develop personality and individuality, which stemmed from their group and the social interactions they encountered. Individual life, and thus individuality and personality essentially arose from collective life.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt;

==Lifespan perspectives==

Classic theories of personality, such as [[Freud’s tripartite theory]], and post-Freudian theory, including [[developmental stage theories]] and [[personality type|type theories]], have often held the perspective that most personality development occurs in childhood, and that personality is stable by the end of adolescence. As recently as the 1990s, modern personality theorists concurred with [[William James]]’ 1890 assertion that, by age 30, personality is “set like plaster”.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T. Jr. &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1994). Set like plaster? Evidence for the stability of adult personality. In T. F. Heatherton &amp; J. L. Weinberger (Eds.), Can personality change? (pp.&amp;nbsp;21–40). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, lifespan perspectives that integrate theory and empirical findings dominate the research literature. The lifespan perspective                         of personality is based on the ''plasticity principle'', that personality traits are open systems that can be influenced by the environment at any age.&lt;ref name="Roberts, B. W. 2010 pp. 375-398"/&gt; This interactional model of development emphasizes the relationships between an individual and her environment, and suggests that there is a dialectic between continuity and change throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. B. | year = 1997 | title = On the incomplete architecture of human ontogeny: Selection, optimization, and compensation as foundation of developmental theory | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 366–380 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.4.366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. W. &amp; Caspi, A. (2003). The cumulative continuity model of personality development: Striking a balance between continuity and change in personality traits across the life course. In U. Staudinger &amp; U. Lindenberger (Eds.), Understanding human development: Life span psychology in exchange with other disciplines (pp.183-214). Dodrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;
Large-scale longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the most active period of personality development appears to be between the ages of 20-40.&lt;ref name="Roberts, B. W. 2010 pp. 375-398"/&gt; Personality grows increasingly consistent with age and plateaus sometime around age 50, but never reaches a period of total stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Mroczek | first2 = D. | year = 2008 | title = Personality trait change in adulthood | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 31–35 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00543.x | pmid=19756219 | pmc=2743415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although change is less likely later in life, individuals retain the potential for change from infancy to old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B. W. | last2 = DelVecchio | first2 = W. F. | year = 2000 | title = The rank-order consistency of personality traits from childhood to old age: A quantitative review of longitudinal studies | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = | pages = 3–25 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.1.3 | pmid=10668348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing factors==
Personality traits demonstrate moderate levels of continuity, smaller but still significant normative or mean-level changes, and individual differences in change, often late into the life course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B. W. | last2 = Caspi | first2 = A. | last3 = Moffitt | first3 = T. | year = 2001 | title = The kids are alright: Growth and stability in personality development from adolescence to adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 670–683 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.4.670}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is influenced by genetic, environmental, transactional, and [[stochastic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = B. W. | year = 2005 | title = Patterns of continuity: A dynamic model of conceptualizing the stability of individual differences in psychological constructs across the life course | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 60–74 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.112.1.60 | pmid=15631588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Twin and adoption studies have demonstrated that the [[heritability]] of personality traits ranges from .3-.6, with a mean of .5.&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harkness | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lilienfeld | first2 = S. O. | year = 1997 | title = Individual differences science for treatment planning: Personality traits | url = | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 349–360 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.9.4.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritability of .5 means that 50% of variation in observable personality traits is attributable to genetic influences. But a given genotype will lead to a certain phenotype only under the right environmental circumstances.&lt;ref name="South, S. C. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = South | first1 = S. C. | last2 = Krueger | first2 = R. F. | year = 2008 | title = An interactionist perspective on genetic and environmental contributions to personality | url = | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 929–948 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the heritability of a trait may change depending on an individual’s environment and/or life events. An example of the way environment can moderate the expression of a gene is the finding by Heath, Eaves, and Martin (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Eaves | first2 = L. J. | last3 = Martin | first3 = N. G. | year = 1998 | title = Interaction of marital status and genetic risk for symptoms of depression | url = | journal = Twin Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 119–122 | doi=10.1375/136905298320566249}}&lt;/ref&gt; that marriage was a protective factor against depression in genetically identical twins, such that the heritability of depression was as low as 29% in a married twin and as high as 51% in an unmarried twin. Ultimately, emerging evidence suggests that genetic and environmental influences on personality differ depending on other circumstances in a person’s life.&lt;ref name="South, S. C. 2008"/&gt;

===Environmental===
With the effects of genetic similarity removed, children from the same family often appear no more alike than randomly selected strangers;&lt;ref&gt;Turkheimer, E. &amp; Waldron, M. (2000). Non shared environment: A theoretical, methodological, and quantitative review.&lt;/ref&gt; yet identical twins raised apart are nearly as similar in personality as identical twins raised together.&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"/&gt; What these findings suggest is that shared family environment has virtually no effect on personality development, and that similarity between relatives is almost entirely due to shared genetics. Although the shared environment (including features like the personality, parenting styles, and beliefs of parents; socioeconomic status; neighborhood; nutrition; schools attended; number of books in the home; etc.) may have a lasting impact at the extremes of parenting practice, such as outright abuse, most personality researchers have concluded that the majority of “average expectable environments”&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"/&gt; do not have an effect on personality development.

The weakness of shared environmental effects in shaping personality came as a surprise to many psychologists, and spurred research into nonshared environment, or the environmental influences that make siblings different from one another instead of similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Daniels | first2 = D. | year = 1987 | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00055941| pmc = 3147063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non shared environmental effects encompass the variability in behavioral outcomes that is not explained by genetic and family environmental influences. The non shared environment may include differential treatment by parents, individually distinct reactions to the shared family environment, peer influences, and experiences that occur outside the family, as well as test error in measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Asbury | first2 = K. | last3 = Dip | first3 = P. G. | last4 = Dunn | first4 = J. | year = 2001 | title = Why are children in the same family so different? Nonshared environment a decade later | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 225–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, nonshared environment also encompasses the unique roles and environments experienced after leaving the family of origin. Further effects of environment in adulthood are demonstrated by findings that different work, marital, and family experiences are associated with personality change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B.

===Gene-environment interactions===
Van Gestel and Van Broeckhoven (2003) write, “Almost by definition, [[complex traits]] originate from interplay between (multiple) genetic factors and environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Gestel | first1 = S. | last2 = Van Broeckhoven | first2 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Genetics of personality: are we making progress? | url = | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 840–852 | doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001367 | pmid=14515135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between genetic predisposition and the environment are a major factor in personality development. The ''corresponsive principle of personality development'' states that “life experiences may accentuate and reinforce the personality characteristics that were partially responsible for the particular environmental elicitations in the first place”.&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, M. B. &amp; Robins, R. W. (2009). The development of personality across the lifespan. In P. J. Corr &amp; G. Matthews (Eds.), The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology (pp. 191-204). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle summarizes how gene-environment interactions (also called person-situation transactions) maintain and reinforce the continuity of personality throughout the lifespan. Three main types of gene-environment interactions are '''active''' (the process by which individuals with certain genotypes select and create environments that facilitate the expression of those genotypes), '''passive''' (the process by which genetic parents provide both the genes and the early environmental influences that contribute to the development of a characteristic in their children), and '''reactive''' (the process by which non-family individuals respond to the behavior produced by a genotype in characteristic ways).&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4988">The '''Rationalist Society of Australia''' ('''RSA''') promotes the interests of [[rationalist]]s nationally in Australia. Originally formed as the Victorian Rationalist Association, the society originated in a meeting of freethinkers in the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter17.html|title=Rationalist Society of Australia|author=Ian Robinson|work=A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand|publisher=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the operational arm of the rationalist movement in Australia.

The society created a rationalist library in 1909, and grew its collection though donations. The society ran the 1910 and 1913 Australian tours of rationalist thinker, [[Joseph McCabe]].&lt;ref name=vulib/&gt; A number of trade unionists and social campaigners sought to advance political causes, including [[Robert Samuel Ross]] and [[Alfred Foster (judge)|Alfred Foster]].

* to propound and advance rationalism, that is, adherence to the principle that all significant beliefs and actions should be based on reason and evidence, that the natural world is the only world there is and that answers to the key questions of human existence are to be found only in that natural world
* to stimulate freedom of thought, and to promote inquiry into religious beliefs and practices
* to encourage interest in science, criticism and philosophy, as connected factors in a progressive human culture, independent of theological creeds and dogmas
* to promote the fullest possible use of science for human welfare
* to promote a secular and ethical system of education
* to print, publish or re-issue any journal, magazine, newspaper or other periodical publication and standard or notable books on science, criticism, ethics or philosophy, and to support the printing, publication or reissuing of the same by any other person
* to aid the progress of rationalism by means of literature, popular scientific lectures, and other promotions.

'''Repechage''' ({{IPAc-en|ɹ|ə|p|ɛ|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|ʒ}}; {{lang-fr|repêchage}}, "fishing out, rescuing") is a practice in series competitions that allows participants who failed to meet qualifying standards by a small margin to continue to the next round, in a similar way as a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card system]] works out.

{{wiktionary|repechage}}

== Types ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Different types of repechage can occur.  As a basis for the examples below, assume that 64 competitors are divided into four pools of 16 competitors, labeled A, B, C, and D.  The first three rounds of the primary championship bracket winnow the field down to eight competitors for the quarter-final.

=== Full repechage ===
In full repechage, a competitor who loses to the pool winner drops into the repechage bracket. The theory is that a worthy competitor who is paired with another worthy competitor should not be unduly penalized by luck of the draw, but have an opportunity to fight for at least third place.  In our example, four competitors from each pool (the loser to the pool winner in the first, second, third and quarter-final rounds) drop into the repechage bracket.  A larger pool results in a longer wait for first-round losers to determine if they will compete in repechage.

=== Quarter-final repechage ===
Quarter-final repechage pulls losers from the quarter-final round only.  The prior rounds are single-elimination.  Losers in the quarter-final from two pools (e.g., A and B) are entered into one bracket of the repechage first round. Quarter-final losers from the other two pools are entered into the other bracket. Repechage losers are placed in seventh place. Winners of these matches play against semifinal losers of opposite bracket. Losers are placed in fifth place and winners are awarded with bronze medal each.

=== Double-elimination repechage ===
In [[double-elimination tournament|double-elimination]] repechage, any loser in the championship bracket drops into the repechage bracket.  Typically the losers from the championship bracket's first round compete against each other in the repechage first round for the right to compete in the repechage second round (against the championship bracket second round losers).  In ''full'' double-elimination repechage, the eventual repechage bracket winner competes against the championship bracket winner to determine the winner of the overall competition, but the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to win the competition whereas the championship bracket winner needs only win one match.  In a ''partial'' double-elimination repechage bracket, the bracket winner(or winners in dual third-place scenario) will take third place.

=== Repechage bracket with two third place finishers ===
Dual third-place finishers can result with full, quarter-final, or double-elimination repechage.  Losers from two championship bracket pools (e.g., A and B) are placed into one repechage bracket and losers from the other two pools are placed in the other repechage bracket.  The winner from each pool's repechage bracket competes against the loser in the championship semi-final who comes from one of that repechage bracket's two pools.  Or, in a "cross-over" arrangement, the semi-final loser comes from the other bracket's pools.  Each winner of this repechage round takes third place.  The losers of the prior two repechage rounds are often considered to take fifth and seventh places.

=== Consolation bracket ===
A consolation bracket is when losers drop from the primary championship bracket and compete for [[Third place playoff|third place]] or a lesser [[consolation prize]].  Hence, except in the case of full double-elimination repechage, a repechage bracket might be referred to as a consolation bracket.

== Usage ==

=== Baseball and softball ===
In [[Major League Baseball]] a repechage bracket is formed by [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams in each League. Entry to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Postseason]] is determined by the [[Wild Card Game]].

At many levels of amateur play in [[baseball]] and [[softball]], including the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], tournaments are established as a full double-elimination repechage.

In the current 64-team baseball and softball NCAA tournament formats, there are alternating four-team double-elimination repechage formats, and best two-of-three games series.  The first and third rounds are full double-elimination repechages, while the second and fourth rounds are best two-of-three game series.

The [[Southeastern Conference]] baseball tournament has a flip-bracket format; the winner of the first championship bracket plays the winner of the second repechage bracket, and the winner of the second championship bracket plays the winner of the first repechage bracket.  As usual, the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to advance to the championship game.

=== Beach volleyball ===
Some competitions use a modified double elimination format called Olympic Crossing, in which the winning teams compete until two teams remain, while teams with one loss continue in an elimination format until two of them remain. Then, in the semifinals, each of the two remaining winning teams play a team from the losers bracket, and the winners of these matches compete in the final match, while the semifinal losers compete for third place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-04-07/community/0004060624_1_double-elimination-format-championship-bracket-double-fault  Glossary Of Beach Volleyball Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cycling ===
In [[cycling]], repechage heats are used in the [[Keirin]] and [[match sprints]]. These heats give a second chance for non-qualifiers in the preliminary heat(s) to advance to the next round of competition.

=== Fencing ===
Although not normally used for [http://britishfencing.com/uploads/files/fie_rules_-_organisation_rules_-_dec_2014.pdf FIE events], sometime local events use direct elimination with repechage.  A disadvantage is that some competitors have to wait.  An advantage for team events is more willingness to use DE from the start (with seeding by drawing lots) instead of pools.  Example format sheets are [http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Fencing/Membership/Divisions/Division-Officer-Resources/Score-and-Pool-Sheets here].

Repechage was formerly widely used in [[fencing]] tournaments, but the majority have now abandoned it, an exception being [[United States Fencing Association]] Division I tournaments.

=== Martial arts ===
In [[karate]], [[judo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sports and Organization Rules of the International Judo Federation |url=http://www.intjudo.eu/pictures/news/570_1_1.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] |accessdate= 4 December 2010 |edition=2010 |year=2010 |publisher=[[International Judo Federation]] |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |page=7 |chapter=System of Competition |quote=7.1 An elimination system with repechage starting at the quarter-final (last 8), i.e. for all categories the competitors will be divided into two tables by a "draw", and an elimination system will be used to produce two finalists, who will compete for the gold medal.

The winners (2) of those contests are placed third; The losers (2) are placed fifth; The losers (2) of repechage contests are placed seventh.}}  Example brackets are depicted at pp. 58–66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[taekwondo]], and [[wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 2010 | title = International Wrestling Rules | publisher = [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles]] | location = Corsier-sur-Vevey, Suisse | page = 10 | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/regles/2009_wrestling_rules.pdf | accessdate = 5 March 2012 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]| quote = Pairing is made in the order of the numbers drawn at random. All wrestlers who lost against both finalists will have repechage matches.

The repechage matches begin with wrestlers who lost in the first round including in matches to obtain the ideal number against one of the two finalists up to the losers in the semi-finals by direct elimination. The winners of the two repechage groups will receive each the bronze medal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; tournaments, single-elimination brackets are used to determine the two athletes who will compete in the final for first and second place. The repechage bracket is built from athletes who were knocked out by the finalists and building brackets to determine third place.

Repechage addresses the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal.

===Quiz===

In ''[[University Challenge]]'', 28 teams compete in each season. Of the fourteen teams who lose in the first round, the four teams with the highest scores compete in the Highest Scoring Losers Play-Offs, with the two winners advancing to the second round.

===Rowing  ===
In [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], often only the first one or two boats in a race will qualify automatically for the next round, and the other boats race again in one or more repechage to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Competition Rowing | publisher = [[International Rowing Federation]] | url = http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204080143/http://worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archivedate = 4 December 2010 | quote = Repechages – in cases of up to 24 entries in one boat class and in cases of 37 to 54 entries, every crew who has not qualified for the next round of racing in the heats has a second chance to advance through the repechages round.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditions such as wind vary between the heats, often significantly affecting a competitor's time, and the repechage system allows the "fastest losers" to qualify irrespective of the variable conditions in the opening heats.

===Rugby ===
In [[rugby football|rugby]], the qualification processes for the [[Rugby Union World Cup]] and the [[Rugby League World Cup]] use a repechage system. The [[Air New Zealand Cup]], [[New Zealand]]'s domestic professional competition in Union, used the repechage in the [[2006 Air New Zealand Cup]], but scrapped it for the [[2007 Air New Zealand Cup]].

=== Sailing ===
A repechage stage in [[sailing]] is sometimes used in match-racing competition to allow teams finishing the round robin(s) just below the top-level teams a chance to advance to the quarter-final stage. This is standard competition for the Olympic-class events, such as the [[ISAF Sailing World Cup]].

=== Track and field athletics ===
In [[track and field|field athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round depends on meeting or surpassing a specified minimum result.  The remaining qualification spots (if any) are given in order to the best results.

In [[track and field|track athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round is given to the best competitors in each heat.  Other competitors with the best times may qualify for the next round indirectly as "fastest losers" as a result of the repechage.  If a particular heat was significantly faster than the others, repechage spots can be all taken by athletes from that heat.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to repechage include [[Single-elimination tournament|single elimination]], [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]], [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] and the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19416">The '''Right to Buy''' scheme is a policy in the United Kingdom (with the exception of [[Scotland]] since August 1, 2016) which gives [[Secure tenancy|secure tenants]] of [[Council house|councils]] and some [[housing association]]s the [[legal right]] to buy, at a large discount, the council house they are living in. There is also a '''Right to Acquire''' for [[Assured tenancy|assured tenants]] of housing association homes built with public subsidy after 1997, at a smaller discount. About 1,500,000 homes in the UK have been sold in this manner since the introduction of the scheme in 1980.

Supporters claim that the programme has given millions of households a tangible asset, secured their families' finances and—by releasing cash to repay local authority debt—helped improve the public finances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Critics claim that the policy compounded a housing shortage for people of low income, initiated a national house price bubble, and led ultimately to what is commonly recognised as the displacement and [[social cleansing]] of traditional communities.&lt;ref&gt;MKoore, Thatcher'' p 471&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Councilhousing04.jpg|thumb|alt=Council Housing|Council-type housing stock in [[Weaverham]], now mostly owner-occupied]]
Individual local authorities have always had the ability to sell [[council house]]s to their tenants, but until the early 1970s such sales were extremely rare.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] initially proposed the idea of the right of tenants to own the house they live in, in their manifesto for the [[1959 UK general election|1959 general election]] which they subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Housing, [http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml 1959 Labour Party manifesto]. Retrieved 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-controlled [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) of the late 1960s was persuaded by [[Horace Cutler]], its Chairman of Housing, to create a general sales scheme. Cutler disagreed with the concept of local authorities as providers of housing, and supported a free-market approach. GLC housing sales were not allowed during the Labour administration of the mid-1970s, but picked up again once Cutler became Leader in 1977. They proved extremely popular. Cutler was close to [[Margaret Thatcher]] (MP for [[Finchley (constituency)|Finchley]]) who made the right to buy council housing a Conservative Party policy nationally. The policy was largely in place for the 1974 Conservative manifesto, but did not prove an asset in the two general elections that year because of high interest and mortgage repayment rates, as well as the growth of negative equity as house prices fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-right-to-buy-history-and-prospect|title=The Right to Buy: History and Prospect|last=Murie|first=Alan|date=11 November 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, council house sales to tenants began to increase. Some 7,000 were sold to their tenants during 1970; this soared to more than 45,000 in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14380936 |work=BBC News |title=What future for social housing? |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thatcher policies===
After Margaret Thatcher became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the [[Housing Act 1980]]. [[Michael Heseltine]], in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation. Some 6,000,000 people were affected; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit. Heseltine noted that "no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people". He said the right to buy had two main objectives: to give people what they wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual.

He said: "There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership. The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered. It reflects the wishes of the people, ensures the wide spread of wealth through society, encourages a personal desire to improve and modernise one's own home, enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society."&lt;ref&gt;"Housing Bill – Provisions and Enactment" in ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' v. 27, January, 1981 p. 30644&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale price of a council house was based on its market valuation but also included a discount of between 33% and 50% (up to 70% for council flats), to reflect the rents paid by tenants and also to encourage take-up. According to a government survey in 1988, the average discount that had been offered was 44%.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckett|first1=Andy|title=The right to buy: the housing crisis that Thatcher built|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/26/right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-david-cameron-housing-crisis|accessdate=27 June 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortgages involved no downpayments. The legislation gave council tenants the right to buy their council house at a discounted value, depending on how long they had been living in the house, with the proviso that if they sold their house before a minimum period had expired they would have to pay back a proportion of the discount. The sales were an attractive deal for tenants; hundreds of thousands of homes were sold. The policy became one of the major points of [[Thatcherism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Polly Toynbee]], "It's on the house," [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/11/society.housing ''The Guardian,'' 11 October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy proved immediately popular. Some local Labour-controlled councils were opposed, but the legislation prevented them from blocking purchases, and gave them half the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: From Grantham to the Falklands'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were much higher in the south and east of England than in [[inner London]] and [[northern England]].&lt;ref&gt;Murrie (1989) p 221&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were restricted to general-needs housing; adapted properties and those built specifically for older people were exempted from the scheme. 

Half the proceeds of the sales were paid to the local authorities, but the government restricted authorities' use of most of the money to reducing their debt until it was cleared, rather than spending it on building more homes. The effect was to reduce the council housing stock, especially in areas where property prices were high, such as London and the south-east of England.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22077190 BBC article: Right-to-buy: Margaret Thatcher's controversial gift&lt;/ref&gt;

200,000 council houses were sold to their tenants in 1982. By 1987, more than 1,000,000 council houses in the UK had been sold to their tenants, although the number of council houses purchased by tenants declined during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Slide 4, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm Thatcher years in graphics], BBC News, 18 November 2005. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour Party was initially against the sales, and pledged to oppose them at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] general election, but then dropped its official opposition to the scheme in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4017000/4017019.stm |work=BBC News |title=1979: Council tenants will have 'right to buy' |date=20 December 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], the Conservative government warned voters that a Labour government would still abolish the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/newspaper-advertisement-for-the-british-conservative-party-news-photo/92063336 Newspaper advert for Conservative Party] by [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], 1987. Getty Images. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Labour returned to power at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities which had severe pressure on their housing stock; this included almost the whole of London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/HRD28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to Buy rules after 2005==
The Right to Buy rules were changed in 2005. Five years' tenancy was now required for new tenants to qualify, and properties purchased after January 2005 could no longer immediately be placed on the open market should the owner decide to sell. Such owners now had to approach their previous landlord (council or housing association) and offer them "first right of refusal". If the previous landlord was no longer in existence, for example in cases where the former landlord was a registered social landlord that has ceased business, then the property had to first be offered to the local housing authority.

The time in which a Right to Buy conveyance should take place was reduced from 12 months to 3 months. The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) now governed and regulated most types of mortgage-selling.

The FCA's governance of Right to Buy purchases was partly to solve the widespread problem of Right to Buy mis-selling from brokers and solicitors alike. Each had their own agenda and many were charging excessive fees which were then taken out of their client's discount. The above actions that have been taken coupled with the end of the boom period seem to have brought this problem under control.

In 2009, the [[Localis]] think tank suggested, as part of a review of principles for social housing reform, that the right to buy should be extended into equity slivers, which could be part-earned through being a good tenant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localis.org.uk/images/Localis%20Principles%20for%20Social%20Housing%20Reform%20WEB.pdf Principles for Social Housing Reform], Localis, 2009. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualifying period changed from 5 years to 3 years (edited rbcdd3117 in 2018)

==Recent changes==
At the 2011 [[Conservative Party Conference]], [[David Cameron]] proposed to increase Right to Buy discounts in order to revitalise the housing market and generate receipts which could be spent on new housing. Social housing professionals expressed concerns over the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SALE! (while stocks last)|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/sale!-(while-stocks-last)/6519917.article|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Inside Housing|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 April 2012, the Right to Buy discount was increased to a maximum of £75,000 or 60% of the house value (70% for a flat) depending on which is lower. In March 2013, the maximum discount in London was increased to £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reforming the Right to Buy in 2012 &amp; 2013|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06251|work=Commons Library Standard Note|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum amount of discount changes annually wef April 2017 it changed to £78,600.00 (edited 2018 rbc dd3117)

The maximum right to buy discount increases each financial year in line with CPI as at the previous September (see separate document from the Right to Buy Team, Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

As the CPI in September 2017 was 3% the new maximum discounts for Redditch in respect of the financial year 2018/19 will be £80,900 and applies to all applications made by the tenant on or after 6 April 2018.  Any applications made before then are processed using the current discounts (£78,600). In summary discount is a maximum of £80,900.00 from April 2018 (rbcdd3117)

The aim of the scheme is, for every additional home sold, a new home will be built for 'affordable rent'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affordable Rent|url=http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/affordable-rent|publisher=DCLG}}&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 80% of market rent, aimed at maintaining the level of affordable housing while also increasing the number of properties available for those on the waiting list. The five year tenancy criterion will remain, and should the property be sold within the first five years of the original sale, part or all of the discount will be required to be paid back.

The [[Housing and Planning Act 2016|Housing and Planning Bill 2016]] will if enacted extend right-to-buy to housing association tenants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/05/expert-views-housing-bill-end-affordable-housing&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the [[Scottish Government]] confirmed that Right to Buy would be abolished in Scotland from 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23155904|title='Right to buy' to be scrapped in Scotland|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the end abolished as a part of the [[Housing (Scotland) Act 2014]] from 1 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00463751.pdf The Right to Buy Notice Period].

In the summer of 2017, the [[Welsh Government]] proposed a law to abolish Right to Buy in [[Wales]]. This law was passed by the [[Welsh Assembly]] in December 2017, and the scheme will effectively end on 26 January 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Government{{!}}Abolition of the Right to Buy and Associated Rights (Wales) Act 2018 |url=https://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en |website=gov.wales |accessdate=18 September 2018 |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
The Right to Buy scheme has been criticised for the following reasons:
*Speculating investors were able to buy up council properties through deferred transaction agreements, hastening the rise in property costs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Nick|first = Sommerlad|title = Great Tory housing shame: Third of ex-council homes now owned by rich landlords| newspaper = The Daily Mirror| date = 5 March 2013|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/right-to-buy-housing-shame-third-ex-council-1743338}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}
*Commercially and socially valuable council assets being sold at below their market value or replacement cost;
*The remaining stock of council housing was concentrated in undesirable areas with little employment opportunity, further isolating and stigmatising the tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Carol|title=Built to Last?: Reflections on British Housing Policy|year=1992|publisher=ROOF Magazine|isbn=978-1870767583|pages=214|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Built-Last-Reflections-British-Housing/dp/1870767586/ref=dp_ob_title_bk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in January 2013 by [[London Assembly]] member [[Tom Copley]], From Right to Buy to Buy to Let,&lt;ref&gt;From Right to Buy to Buy to Let [http://tomcopley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/From-Right-to-Buy-to-Buy-to-Let-Jan-2014.pdf From Right to Buy to Buy to Let]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 36% of homes sold under Right to Buy in London (52,000 homes) were being rented by councils from private landlords, leading to criticisms that the scheme "represents incredibly poor value for money to taxpayers" since it "helped to fuel the increase in the housing benefit bill, heaped more pressure on local authority waiting lists and led to more Londoners being forced into the under-regulated private rented sector".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = |first = |title = Councils are renting sold Right to Buy homes, says report| newspaper = BBC London News| date = 13 January 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25710150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A survey in 2013 showed around one third of Right to Buy houses were now owned by private landlords, while the son of the late [[Ian Gow]] (Thatcher's sometime housing minister) owned some 40 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/28/new-class-landlords-profiting-generation-rent|title=Meet the new class of landlords profiting from Generation Rent|work=Guardian Newspapers|author=Patrick Collinson|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of recent changes in 2015, Alan Murie concluded that "the proposed extension of right-to-buy could not easily be reconciled with the independence and charitable status of housing associations", and that "extending the right-to-buy to housing association tenants revived a previous Parliamentary debate and raised questions about the legal position of charities and the risks faced by housing associations and their funders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-right-to-buy-history-and-prospect|title=The Right to Buy: History and Prospect|last=Murie|first=Alan|date=11 November 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 BBC survey of council areas where waiting lists were rising showed the councils had bought back houses they had been forced to sell, sometimes at many times the original price. Housing charities criticised the lack of investment in affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39264631|title=Town halls buy back Right-to-Buy homes|author= Alex Homer|work=BBC news|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''sanankuya'' relationships that are pre-established between certain ethnic or professional clans, a ''sanankuya'' relationship can also be established between any two willing participants who have "broken the ice".  Those in a ''sanankuya'' relationship may treat one another as if cousins or close family members with whom familiar jokes or humorous insults are exchanged. It is considered an essential element of Mande/West African society/and was reputedly ordained as a civic duty in the ''[[Kurukan Fuga]]'', the oral Constitution of the [[Mali Empire]], by [[Sundiata Keita]] in c. 1236.  

The effects of the complex and longstanding custom on West African society may also be seen surviving in [[African-American culture]] in such cultural institutions as "[[the Dozens]]", as well as the custom of non-blood relatives according each other the status of familial relationships ("play" aunts, cousins, etc.).

For an example, the [[Traoré]] and Koné clans each maintain a ''sanankuya'' relationship with the others' members, and one of the biggest running jokes is that each clan will accuse the other of loving to eat beans the most.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36265">In mathematics, a '''semigroup''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] together with an [[associative]] [[binary operation]].

The binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted [[multiplication|multiplicatively]]: ''x''·''y'', or simply ''xy'', denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the [[ordered pair]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}. Associativity is formally expressed as that {{nowrap|1=(''x''·''y'')·''z'' = ''x''·(''y''·''z'')}} for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in the semigroup.

The name "semigroup" originates in the fact that a semigroup generalizes a [[group (mathematics)|group]] by preserving only [[group (mathematics)#Definition|associativity and closure under the binary operation from the axioms defining a group]] while omitting the requirement for an identity element and inverses.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The closure axiom is implied by the definition of a binary operation on a set. Some authors thus omit it and specify three ''laws'' for a group and only one law (associativity) for semigroup.&lt;/ref&gt; From the opposite point of view (of adding rather than removing [[axioms]]), a semigroup is an associative [[magma (algebra)|magma]]. As in the case of groups or magmas, the semigroup operation need not be [[commutativity|commutative]], so ''x''·''y'' is not necessarily equal to ''y''·''x''; a typical example of associative but non-commutative operation is [[matrix multiplication]]. If the semigroup operation is commutative, then the semigroup is called a ''commutative semigroup'' or (less often than in the [[abelian group|analogous case of groups]]) it may be called an ''abelian semigroup''.

A [[monoid]] is an algebraic structure intermediate between groups and semigroups, and is a semigroup having an [[identity element]], thus obeying all but one of the axioms of a group; existence of inverses is not required of a monoid. A natural example is [[string (computer science)|strings]] with [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the empty string as the identity element. Restricting to non-empty [[string (computer science)|strings]] gives an example of a semigroup that is not a monoid. Positive [[integer]]s with addition form a commutative semigroup that is not a monoid, whereas the non-negative [[integer]]s do form a monoid. A semigroup without an identity element can be easily turned into a monoid by just adding an identity element. Consequently, monoids are studied in the theory of semigroups rather than in group theory. Semigroups should not be confused with [[quasigroup]]s, which are a generalization of groups in a different direction; the operation in a quasigroup need not be associative but quasigroups [[Group (mathematics)#Division|preserve from groups]] a notion of [[Division (mathematics)|division]]. Division in semigroups (or in monoids) is not possible in general.

The formal study of semigroups began in the early 20th century. Early results include [[Transformation semigroup#Cayley representation|a Cayley theorem for semigroups]] realizing any semigroup as [[transformation semigroup]], in which arbitrary functions replace the role of bijections from group theory. Other fundamental techniques of studying semigroups like [[Green's relations]] do not imitate anything in group theory though. A deep result in the classification of finite semigroups is [[Krohn–Rhodes theory]]. The theory of finite semigroups has been of particular importance in [[theoretical computer science]] since the 1950s because of the natural link between finite semigroups and [[finite automata]] via the [[syntactic monoid]]&lt;!-- ({{harvnb|Eilenberg|1973}}, [[#CITEREFEilenberg1976|1976]])--&gt;.  In [[probability theory]], semigroups are associated with [[Markov process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Feller|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the variety of linear recurrences and numerical semigroups|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00233-013-9551-2|journal = [[Semigroup Forum]]|date = 2013-11-14|issn = 0037-1912|pages = 569–574|volume = 88|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00233-013-9551-2|language = en|first = Ivan|last = Martino|first2 = Luca|last2 = Martino|arxiv = 1207.0111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas of [[applied mathematics]], semigroups are fundamental models for [[linear time-invariant system]]s.  In [[partial differential equations]], a semigroup is associated to any equation whose spatial evolution is independent of time. There are numerous [[special classes of semigroups]], semigroups with additional properties, which appear in particular applications. Some of these classes are even closer to groups by exhibiting some additional but not all properties of a group. Of these we mention: [[regular semigroup]]s, [[orthodox semigroup]]s, [[semigroup with involution|semigroups with involution]], [[inverse semigroup]]s and [[cancellative semigroup]]s. There also interesting classes of semigroups that do not contain any groups except the [[trivial group]]; examples of the latter kind are [[band (mathematics)|bands]] and their commutative subclass&amp;mdash;[[semilattice]]s, which are also [[:Category:Ordered algebraic structures|ordered algebraic structure]]s.

== Definition ==

A semigroup is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[binary operation]] "&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;" (that is, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\cdot:S\times S\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;) that satisfies the [[associative property]]:

:For all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in S&lt;/math&gt;, the equation &lt;math&gt;(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot(b\cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; holds.

More succinctly, a semigroup is an associative [[magma (algebra)|magma]].

== Examples of semigroups ==
* [[Empty semigroup]]: the empty set forms a semigroup with the [[empty function]] as the binary operation.
* [[Semigroup with one element]]: there is essentially only one (specifically, only one [[up to]] [[isomorphism]]), the singleton {''a''} with operation {{nowrap|1=''a'' · ''a'' = ''a''}}.
* [[Semigroup with two elements]]: there are five which are essentially different.
* The set of positive [[integer]]s with addition. (With 0 included, this becomes a [[monoid]].)
* The set of [[integer]]s with minimum or maximum. (With positive/negative infinity included, this becomes a monoid.)
* Square [[Nonnegative matrix|nonnegative matrices]] of a given size with matrix multiplication.
* Any [[ring ideal|ideal]] of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] with the multiplication of the ring.
* The set of all finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] over a fixed alphabet Σ with [[concatenation]] of strings as the semigroup operation — the so-called "[[free semigroup]] over Σ". With the empty string included, this semigroup becomes the [[free monoid]] over Σ.
* A probability distribution F together with all [[convolution power]]s of F, with convolution as the operation. This is called a convolution semigroup.
* A [[monoid]] is a semigroup with an [[identity element]].
* A [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a monoid in which every element has an [[inverse element]].
* [[Transformation semigroup]]s and [[transformation monoid|monoids]].
* The set of [[continuous function]]s  from a [[topological space]] to itself with composition of functions forms a monoid with the [[identity function]] acting as the identity. More generally, the [[Endomorphism|endomorphisms]] of any object of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] form a monoid under composition.

==Basic concepts==

=== Identity and zero ===
A '''[[left identity]]''' of a semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally, [[magma (algebra)|magma]]) is an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ex = x&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, a '''[[right identity]]''' is an element &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xf = x&lt;/math&gt;. Left and right identities are both called '''one-sided identities'''.  A semigroup may have one or more left identities but no right identity, and vice versa.

A '''two-sided identity''' (or just '''identity''') is an element that is both a left and right identity.  Semigroups with a two-sided identity are called '''[[monoid]]s'''.  A semigroup may have at most one two-sided identity.  If a semigroup has a two-sided identity, then the two-sided identity is the only one-sided identity in the semigroup.  If a semigroup has both a left identity and a right identity, then it has a two-sided identity (which is therefore the unique one-sided identity).

A semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; without identity may be [[embedding|embedded]] in a monoid formed by adjoining an element &lt;math&gt;e \notin S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and defining &lt;math&gt;e \cdot s = s \cdot e = s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S \cup \{e\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|2009|p=30, ex. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawson98"&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|1998|loc=[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=_F78nQEACAAJ|page=20|text=adjoining an identity}} p. 20]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; denotes a monoid obtained from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by adjoining an identity ''if necessary'' (&lt;math&gt;S^1 = S&lt;/math&gt; for a monoid).&lt;ref name="lawson98"/&gt;

Similarly, every magma has at most one [[absorbing element]], which in semigroup theory is called a '''zero'''. Analogous to the above construction, for every semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, one can define &lt;math&gt;S^0&lt;/math&gt;, a semigroup with 0 that embeds &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Subsemigroups and ideals ===

The semigroup operation induces an operation on the collection of its subsets: given subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a semigroup ''S'', their product {{nowrap|''A'' · ''B''}}, written commonly as ''AB'', is the set {{nowrap|{ ''ab'' {{!}} ''a'' in ''A'' and ''b'' in ''B'' }.}} (This notion is defined identically as [[Product of group subsets|it is for groups]].) In terms of this operation, a subset ''A'' is called
* a '''subsemigroup''' if ''AA'' is a subset of ''A'',
* a '''right ideal''' if ''AS'' is a subset of ''A'', and
* a '''left ideal''' if ''SA'' is a subset of ''A''.

If ''A'' is both a left ideal and a right ideal then it is called an '''ideal''' (or a '''two-sided ideal''').

If ''S'' is a semigroup, then the intersection of any collection of subsemigroups of ''S'' is also a subsemigroup of ''S''.
So the subsemigroups of ''S'' form a [[complete lattice]].

An example of semigroup with no minimal ideal is the set of positive integers under addition. The minimal ideal of a [[commutative]] semigroup, when it exists, is a group.

[[Green's relations]], a set of five [[equivalence relation]]s that characterise the elements in terms of the [[principal ideal]]s they generate, are important tools for analysing the ideals of a semigroup and related notions of structure.

The subset with the property that its every element commutes with any other element of the semigroup is called the '''[[center (algebra)|center]]''' of the semigroup.&lt;ref name="KilpKilʹp2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mati |last=Kilp |first2=U. |last2=Knauer |first3=Aleksandr V. |last3=Mikhalev |title=Monoids, Acts, and Categories: With Applications to Wreath Products and Graphs : a Handbook for Students and Researchers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gPhmmW-EGcC&amp;pg=PA25 |year=2000 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-015248-7 |page=25 |zbl=0945.20036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center of a semigroup is actually a subsemigroup.&lt;ref name="Li͡apin1968"&gt;{{cite book |first=E. S. |last=Li͡apin|title=Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8pWKPp4tKwC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1968|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-8641-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homomorphisms and congruences ===

A '''semigroup [[homomorphism]]''' is a function that preserves semigroup structure.  A function {{nowrap|''f'': ''S'' → ''T''}} between two semigroups is a homomorphism if the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'')}}.
holds for all elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', i.e. the result is the same when performing the semigroup operation after or before applying the map ''f''.

A semigroup homomorphism between monoids preserves identity if it is a [[monoid homomorphism]]. But there are semigroup homomorphisms which are not monoid homomorphisms, e.g. the canonical embedding of a semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; without identity into &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Conditions characterizing monoid homomorphisms are discussed further. Let &lt;math&gt;f:S_0\to S_1&lt;/math&gt; be a semigroup homomorphism. The image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is also a semigroup. If &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid with an identity element &lt;math&gt;e_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(e_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element in the image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; is also a monoid with an identity element &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(e_0)=e_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid homomorphism. Particularly, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[surjective]], then it is a monoid homomorphism.

Two semigroups ''S'' and ''T'' are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if there is a [[bijection]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' ↔ ''T''}} with the property that, for any elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'')}}. Isomorphic semigroups have the same structure.

A '''semigroup congruence''' &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]] that is compatible with the semigroup operation. That is, a subset &lt;math&gt;\sim\;\subseteq S\times S&lt;/math&gt; that is an equivalence relation and &lt;math&gt;x\sim y\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u\sim v\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;xu\sim yv\,&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x,y,u,v&lt;/math&gt; in ''S''. Like any equivalence relation, a semigroup congruence &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; induces [[equivalence class|congruence class]]es

:&lt;math&gt;[a]_\sim = \{x\in S\vert\; x\sim a\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the semigroup operation induces a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; on the congruence classes:

:&lt;math&gt;[u]_\sim\circ [v]_\sim = [uv]_\sim&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence, the set of all congruence classes of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; forms a semigroup with &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''quotient semigroup''' or '''factor semigroup''', and denoted &lt;math&gt;S/\sim&lt;/math&gt;. The mapping &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto [x]_\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup homomorphism, called the '''quotient map''', '''canonical [[surjection]]''' or '''projection'''; if S is a monoid then quotient semigroup is a monoid with identity &lt;math&gt;[1]_\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the [[Kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of any semigroup homomorphism is a semigroup congruence. These results are nothing more than a particularization of the [[Isomorphism theorems#First Isomorphism Theorem 4|first isomorphism theorem in universal algebra]].  Congruence classes and factor monoids are the objects of study in [[string rewriting system]]s.

A '''nuclear congruence''' on ''S'' is one which is the kernel of an endomorphism of ''S''.&lt;ref name=LotII463&gt;{{harvnb|Lothaire|2011|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A semigroup ''S'' satisfies the '''maximal condition on congruences''' if any family of congruences on ''S'', ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element.  By [[Zorn's lemma]], this is equivalent to saying that the [[ascending chain condition]] holds: there is no infinite strictly ascending chain of congruences on ''S''.&lt;ref name=LotII465&gt;{{harvnb|Lothaire|2011|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every ideal ''I'' of a semigroup induces a subsemigroup, the [[Rees factor semigroup]] via the congruence {{nowrap|''x'' ρ ''y''}} &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp;  either {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}} or both ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''I''.

=== Quotients and divisions ===
The following notions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pin|first1=Jean-Éric|title=Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory|date=November 30, 2016|page=19|url=http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/PDF/MPRI/MPRI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduce the idea that a semigroup is contained in another one.

A semigroup '''T''' is a quotient of a semigroup '''S''' if there is a surjective semigroup morphism from '''T''' to '''S'''. For example, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z,+)&lt;/math&gt;, using the morphism consisting of taking the remainder modulo '''p''' of an integer.

A semigroup '''T''' divides a semigroup '''S''', noted &lt;math&gt;T\preceq S&lt;/math&gt; if '''T''' is a quotient of a subsemigroup '''S'''. In particular, subsemigroups of '''S''' divides '''T''', while it is not necessarily the case that there are a quotient of '''S'''.

Both of those relation are transitive.

== Structure of semigroups ==
For any subset ''A'' of ''S'' there is a smallest subsemigroup ''T'' of ''S'' which contains ''A'', and we say that ''A'' '''generates''' ''T''. A single element ''x'' of ''S'' generates the subsemigroup {{nowrap|{ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} ''n'' is a positive integer }.}}
If this is finite, then ''x'' is said to be of '''finite order''', otherwise it is of '''infinite order'''.
A semigroup is said to be '''periodic''' if all of its elements are of finite order.
A semigroup generated by a single element is said to be [[monogenic semigroup|monogenic]] (or [[Cyclic semigroup|cyclic]]). If a monogenic semigroup is infinite then it is isomorphic to the semigroup of positive [[integer]]s with the operation of addition.
If it is finite and nonempty, then it must contain at least one [[idempotent]].
It follows that every nonempty periodic semigroup has at least one idempotent.

A subsemigroup which is also a group is called a '''[[subgroup]]'''. There is a close relationship between the subgroups of a semigroup and its idempotents. Each subgroup contains exactly one idempotent, namely the identity element of the subgroup. For each idempotent ''e'' of the semigroup there is a unique maximal subgroup containing ''e''. Each maximal subgroup arises in this way, so there is a one-to-one correspondence between idempotents and maximal subgroups. Here the term ''[[maximal subgroup]]'' differs from its standard use in group theory.

More can often be said when the order is finite. For example, every nonempty finite semigroup is periodic, and has a minimal [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] and at least one idempotent. The number of finite semigroups of a given size (greater than 1) is (obviously) larger than the number of groups of the same size. For example, of the sixteen possible "multiplication tables" for a set of two elements {{nowrap|{a, b},}} eight form semigroups&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Namely: the trivial semigroup in which (for all ''x'' and ''y'') {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = a}} and its counterpart in which {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = b}}, the semigroups based on multiplication modulo 2 (choosing a or b as the identity element 1), the groups equivalent to addition modulo 2 (choosing a or b to be the identity element 0), and the semigroups in which the elements are either both left identities or both right identities.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas only four of these are monoids and only two form groups. For more on the structure of finite semigroups, see [[Krohn–Rhodes theory]].

== Special classes of semigroups ==
{{Main|Special classes of semigroups}}
* A [[monoid]] is a semigroup with identity.
* A subsemigroup is a [[subset]] of a semigroup that is closed under the semigroup operation.
* A [[band (algebra)|band]] is a semigroup the operation of which is [[idempotent]].
* A [[cancellative semigroup]] is one having the [[cancellation property]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifford|Preston|1967|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|1=''a'' · ''b'' = ''a'' · ''c''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} and similarly for {{nowrap|1=''b'' · ''a'' = ''c'' · ''a''}}.
* A [[semilattice]] is a semigroup whose operation is idempotent and [[commutativity|commutative]].
* [[0-simple]] semigroups.
* [[Transformation semigroup]]s: any finite semigroup ''S'' can be represented by transformations of a (state-) set ''Q'' of at most {{nowrap|{{abs|''S''}} + 1}} states. Each element ''x'' of ''S'' then maps ''Q'' into itself {{nowrap|''x'': ''Q'' → ''Q''}} and sequence ''xy'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''q''(''xy'') = (''qx'')''y''}} for each ''q'' in ''Q''. Sequencing clearly is an associative operation, here equivalent to [[function composition]]. This representation is basic for any [[automaton]] or [[finite state machine]] (FSM).
* The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is in fact a monoid, which can be described as the [[free semigroup]] on two generators ''p'' and ''q'', under the relation {{nowrap|1=''pq'' = 1}}.
* [[C0-semigroup|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-semigroups]].
* [[Regular semigroup]]s. Every element ''x'' has at least one inverse ''y'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''xyx''=''x''}} and {{nowrap|1=''yxy''=''y''}}; the elements ''x'' and ''y'' are sometimes called "mutually inverse".
* [[Inverse semigroup]]s are regular semigroups where every element has exactly one inverse. Alternatively, a regular semigroup is inverse if and only if any two idempotents commute.
* Affine semigroup: a semigroup that is isomorphic to a finitely-generated subsemigroup of Z&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;.  These semigroups have applications to [[commutative algebra]].

==Structure theorem for commutative semigroups==

There is a structure theorem for commutative semigroups in terms of [[semilattice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grillet|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A semilattice (or more precisely a meet-semilattice) &lt;math&gt; (L, \le) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[partially ordered set]] where every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;a,b \in L&lt;/math&gt; has a [[greatest lower bound]], denoted &lt;math&gt;a \wedge b&lt;/math&gt;.  The operation &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt; into a semigroup satisfying the additional [[idempotence]] law &lt;math&gt; a \wedge a = a &lt;/math&gt;.

Given a homomorphism &lt;math&gt; f: S \to L &lt;/math&gt; from an arbitrary semigroup to a semilattice, each inverse image &lt;math&gt; S_a = f^{-1} \{a \} &lt;/math&gt; is a (possibly empty) semigroup.  Moreover, &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; becomes '''graded''' by &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt;, in the sense that

&lt;math&gt; S_a S_b \subseteq S_{a \wedge b} &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is onto, the semilattice &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the [[quotient]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt; \sim &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x \sim y &lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt; f(x) = f(y) &lt;/math&gt;.  This equivalence relation is a semigroup congruence, as defined above.

Whenever we take the quotient of a commutative semigroup by a congruence, we get another commutative semigroup.  The structure theorem says that for any commutative semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, there is a finest congruence &lt;math&gt; \sim &lt;/math&gt; such that the quotient of &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; by this equivalence relation is a semilattice.  Denoting this semilattice by &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;, we get a homomorphism &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;.  As mentioned, &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; becomes graded by this semilattice.

Furthermore, the components &lt;math&gt; S_a &lt;/math&gt; are all [[Special classes of semigroups|Archimedean semigroups]].  An Archimedean semigroup is one where given any pair of elements &lt;math&gt; x, y &lt;/math&gt;, there exists an element &lt;math&gt; z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x^n = y z &lt;/math&gt;.

The Archimedean property follows immediately from the ordering in the semilattice &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt;, since with this ordering we have &lt;math&gt; f(x) \le f(y) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; x^n = y z &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Group of fractions==
The '''group of fractions''' or '''group completion''' of a semigroup ''S'' is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''G''(''S'')}} generated by the elements of ''S'' as generators and all equations {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''z''}} which hold true in ''S'' as [[presentation of a group|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=B. |last=Farb |title=Problems on mapping class groups and related topics |publisher=Amer. Math. Soc. |year=2006 |isbn=0-8218-3838-5 |page=357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an obvious semigroup homomorphism {{nowrap|''j'' : ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''G''(''S'')}} which sends each element of ''S'' to the corresponding generator. This has a [[universal property]] for morphisms from ''S'' to a group:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Auslander |first2=D. A. |last2=Buchsbaum |title=Groups, rings, modules |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1974 |isbn=0-06-040387-X |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  given any group ''H'' and any semigroup homomorphism {{nowrap|''k'' : ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''H''}}, there exists a unique [[group homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' &amp;rarr; ''H''}} with ''k''=''fj''. We may think of ''G'' as the "most general" group that contains a homomorphic image of ''S''.

An important question is to characterize those semigroups for which this map is an embedding.  This need not always be the case: for example, take ''S'' to be the semigroup of subsets of some set ''X'' with [[set-theoretic intersection]] as the binary operation (this is an example of a semilattice).  Since {{nowrap|1=''A''.''A'' = ''A''}} holds for all elements of ''S'', this must be true for all generators of ''G''(''S'') as well: which is therefore the [[trivial group]].  It is clearly necessary for embeddability that ''S'' have the [[cancellation property]].  When ''S'' is commutative this condition is also sufficient&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifford|Preston|1961|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grothendieck group]] of the semigroup provides a construction of the group of fractions.  The problem for non-commutative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Suschkewitsch|1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Preston_semigroups.html|title=Personal reminiscences of the early history of semigroups|first=G.

==Semigroup methods in partial differential equations==
{{further|C0-semigroup}}

Semigroup theory can be used to study some problems in the field of [[partial differential equations]].  Roughly speaking, the semigroup approach is to regard a time-dependent partial differential equation as an [[ordinary differential equation]] on a function space.  For example, consider the following initial/boundary value problem for the [[heat equation]] on the spatial [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{nowrap|(0, 1) ⊂ '''R'''}} and times {{nowrap|''t'' ≥ 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \partial_{t} u(t, x) = \partial_{x}^{2} u(t, x), &amp; x \in (0, 1), t &gt; 0; \\ u(t, x) = 0, &amp; x \in \{ 0, 1 \}, t &gt; 0; \\ u(t, x) = u_{0} (x), &amp; x \in (0, 1), t = 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;((0, 1) '''R''')}} be the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] of square-integrable real-valued functions with domain the interval {{nowrap|(0, 1)}} and let ''A'' be the second-derivative operator with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]

:&lt;math&gt;D(A) = \big\{ u \in H^{2} ((0, 1); \mathbf{R}) \big| u(0) = u(1) = 0 \big\},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Sobolev space]]. Then the above initial/boundary value problem can be interpreted as an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation on the space ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \dot{u}(t) = A u (t); \\ u(0) = u_{0}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

On an heuristic level, the solution to this problem "ought" to be {{nowrap|1=''u''(''t'') = exp(''tA'')''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  However, for a rigorous treatment, a meaning must be given to the [[exponentiation|exponential]] of ''tA''.  As a function of ''t'', exp(''tA'') is a semigroup of operators from ''X'' to itself, taking the initial state ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} to the state {{nowrap|1=''u''(''t'') = exp(''tA'')''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at time ''t''.  The operator ''A'' is said to be the [[C0 semigroup#Infinitesimal generator|infinitesimal generator]] of the semigroup.

==History==
The study of semigroups trailed behind that of other algebraic structures with more complex axioms such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]] or [[ring (algebra)|rings]]. A number of sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hollings&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://uk.geocities.com/cdhollings/suschkewitsch3.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-25+04:13:15  An account of Suschkewitsch's paper by Christopher Hollings]&lt;/ref&gt; attribute the first use of the term (in French) to J.-A. de Séguier in ''Élements de la Théorie des Groupes Abstraits'' (Elements of the Theory of Abstract Groups) in 1904. The term is used in English in 1908 in Harold Hinton's ''Theory of Groups of Finite Order''.

[[Anton Suschkewitsch]] obtained the first non-trivial results about semigroups. His 1928 paper "Über die endlichen Gruppen ohne das Gesetz der eindeutigen Umkehrbarkeit" ("On finite groups without the rule of unique invertibility") determined the structure of finite [[simple semigroup]]s and showed that the minimal ideal (or [[Green's relations]] J-class) of a finite semigroup is simple.&lt;ref name=Hollings/&gt; From that point on, the foundations of semigroup theory were further laid by [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]], [[James Alexander Green]], [[Evgenii Sergeevich Lyapin]], [[Alfred H. Clifford]] and [[Gordon Preston]]. The latter two published a two-volume monograph on semigroup theory in 1961 and 1967 respectively. In 1970, a new periodical called ''[[Semigroup Forum]]'' (currently edited by [[Springer Verlag]]) became one of the few mathematical journals devoted entirely to semigroup theory.

In recent years researchers in the field have become more specialized with dedicated monographs appearing on important classes of semigroups, like [[inverse semigroup]]s, as well as monographs focusing on applications in [[algebraic automata theory]], particularly for finite automata, and also in [[functional analysis]].

==Generalizations==
{{Group-like structures}}
If the associativity axiom of a semigroup is dropped, the result is a [[magma (mathematics)|magma]], which is nothing more than a set ''M'' equipped with a [[binary operation]] {{math|1=''M'' × ''M'' → ''M''}}.

Generalizing in a different direction, an '''''n''-ary semigroup''' (also '''''n''-semigroup''', '''polyadic semigroup''' or '''multiary semigroup''') is a generalization of a semigroup to a set ''G'' with a [[arity|''n''-ary operation]] instead of a binary operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dudek |first=W.A. |title=On some old problems in ''n''-ary groups |url=http://www.quasigroups.eu/contents/contents8.php?m=trzeci |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714003319/http://www.quasigroups.eu/contents/contents8.php?m=trzeci |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-14 |journal=Quasigroups and Related Systems |year=2001 |volume=8 |pages=15–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The associative law is generalized as follows: ternary associativity is {{math|1=(''abc'')''de'' = ''a''(''bcd'')''e'' = ''ab''(''cde'')}}, i.e. the string ''abcde'' with any three adjacent elements bracketed. ''N''-ary associativity is a string of length {{math|''n'' + (''n'' − ''1'')}} with any ''n'' adjacent elements bracketed. A 2-ary semigroup is just a semigroup. Further axioms lead to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].

A third generalization is the [[semigroupoid]], in which the requirement that the binary relation be total is lifted. As categories generalize monoids in the same way, a semigroupoid behaves much like a category but lacks identities.

Infinitary generalizations of commutative semigroups have sometimes been considered by various authors.&lt;ref&gt;See references in Udo Hebisch and Hanns Joachim  Weinert, ''Semirings  and  Semifields'', in particular, Section 10, ''Semirings  with  infinite sums'', in M.  Hazewinkel, Handbook of Algebra, Vol. 1, Elsevier, 1996. Notice that in this context the authors use the term ''semimodule'' in place of ''semigroup''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">To '''spite''' is to intentionally [[annoy]], [[Suffering|hurt]], or [[Upset (competition)|upset]]. ''Spiteful'' [[word]]s or [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] are delivered in such a way that it is clear that the person is delivering them just to annoy, hurt, or upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/spite|title=spite - definition of spite in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the intent to annoy, hurt, or upset is shown subtly,  behavior is considered ''catty''.&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861595550{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Underground Man, in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', is an example of spite. His motivation remains constantly spiteful, undercutting his own existence and ability to live.

In his 1929 examination of emotional disturbances, ''Psychology and Morals: An Analysis of Character'', J. A. Hadfield uses deliberately spiteful acts to illustrate the difference between disposition and sentiment.&lt;ref name=Hadfield&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology and Morals: An Analysis of Character |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T5xACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22psychology+and+morals%22+analysis+character |website = Google Books preview|accessdate = 2016-05-02|first = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

'''Thomas Nagel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ei|g|əl}}; born July 4, 1937) is an American philosopher and University Professor of Philosophy and Law Emeritus at [[New York University]], where he taught from 1980 to 2016.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; His main areas of philosophical interest are [[philosophy of mind]], [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]].

Nagel is well known for his critique of [[Materialism|material]] [[reductionist]] accounts of the mind, particularly in his essay "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" (1974), and for his contributions to [[deontological]] and liberal moral and political theory in ''The Possibility of Altruism'' (1970) and subsequent writings. He continued the critique of reductionism in ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'' (2012), in which he argues against the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view of the emergence of [[consciousness]].

==Philosophical work==

===Overview===
Nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two; his career now spans over fifty years of publication. Nagel thinks that each person, owing to his or her capacity to reason, instinctively seeks a unified world view. However, if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments, whether about the external world, knowledge, or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be, this leads one into error. For contingent, limited and finite creatures, no such unified world view is possible. That is because ways of understanding are not always better when they are more objective.

Like the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]], Nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it. A modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces. It is more objective because it is less dependent on our peculiarities as the kinds of thinkers that people are. Our modern scientific understanding involves the mathematicized understanding of the world represented by modern [[physics]]. Understanding this beached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility. The way in which modern science and philosophy has [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|drawn a distinction]] between the mathematically and structurally describable "primary qualities" of objects such as shape and solidity and those properties dependent on our sensory apparatus, "secondary qualities" such as taste and color, is a prime example that Nagel returns to repeatedly in his work.

Despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science, Nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us. His contention, rather, is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective. He argues that the subjective viewpoint of scientific understanding, when applied to the mind, leaves out something essential and is fundamentally unable to help people fully understand themselves. In "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" and elsewhere, he writes that science cannot describe what it is like ''to be'' a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective.

Nagel argues that some [[phenomena]] are not best grasped from a more objective perspective. The standpoint of the thinker does not present itself to him: he is that standpoint. One learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one's own mind, whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact. It would, of its nature, leave out what it is to be a thinker, and that, Nagel believes, would be a falsely objectifying view. Being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain.

Nagel thinks that philosophers over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science tend to produce [[Philosophy of mind|theories of the mind]] that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way. They are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity. The kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand.

As a philosophical [[Rationalism|rationalist]], Nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of [[mental properties]] in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental, and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future. A plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects. Now, it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight, or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap, but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding.

Nagel's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite, structured around our capacity to reason, explains why he thinks that [[Therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that [[radical skepticism]] is, strictly speaking, irrefutable.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The therapeutic or deflationary philosopher, influenced by the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our "form of life". Nagel accuses Wittgenstein and American philosopher of mind and language [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] of [[philosophical idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1986, ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared, objective world. This, for Nagel, elevates contingent conditions of our make-up into criteria for that which is real. The result 'cuts the world down to size' and makes what there is dependent on what there can be interpreted to be. Nagel claims this is no better than more orthodox forms of idealism in which reality is claimed to be made up of mental items or claimed to be constitutively dependent on a form supplied by the mind.

===Philosophy of mind===

====What is it like to be a something====
{{further|What Is it Like to Be a Bat?}}
Nagel is probably most widely known within the field of [[philosophy of mind]] as an advocate of the idea that [[consciousness]] and [[subjective experience]] cannot, at least with the contemporary understanding of [[physicalism]], be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics. This position was primarily discussed by Nagel in one of his most famous articles: "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974). The article's title question, though often attributed to Nagel, was originally asked by [[Timothy Sprigge|Timothy M.B. Sprigge]]. The article was originally published in 1974 in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', and has been reprinted several times, including in ''[[The Mind's I]]'' (edited by [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]]), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Psychology'' (edited by Ned Block), Nagel's ''Mortal Questions'' (1979), ''[[The Nature of Mind]]'' (edited by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]), and ''[[Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings]]'' (edited by [[David J. Chalmers]]).

In "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a ''subjective character,'' a ''what it is like'' aspect.  He states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to ''be'' that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics{{who|date=March 2017}} have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world (trivially, one can only do so from his own point of view) to a false claim about the world, that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it. On that understanding, Nagel is a conventional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] about the physical and the mental. This is, however, a misunderstanding{{according to|date=March 2017}}: Nagel's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state, namely, that one be directly acquainted with it. Concepts of mental states are only made available to a thinker who can be acquainted with his/her own states; clearly, the possession and use of physical concepts has no corresponding constraint.

Part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination: influenced by his [[Princeton University|Princeton]] colleague, [[Saul Kripke]], Nagel believes that any [[Type physicalism|type identity]] statement that identified a physical state type with a [[mental state]] type would be, if true, [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. But Kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where, for example, one's [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibres]] are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair. (A parallel argument does not hold for genuine [[Identity (philosophy)|theoretical identities]].) This argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded, Nagel argues, by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways. When asked to imagine ''sensorily'', one imagines C-fibres being stimulated; if asked to imagine ''sympathetically'', one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain. These two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap, whether or not this is the case. (Some philosophers of mind{{who|date=October 2018}} have taken these arguments as helpful for [[physicalism]] on the grounds that it exposes a limitation that makes the existence of an explanatory gap seem compelling, while others{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued that this makes the case for physicalism even more impossible as it cannot be defended even in principle.)

Nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden [[essence]] that underpins a scientific identity in, say, chemistry. But his skepticism is about current physics: he envisages in his most recent work that people may be close to a scientific breakthrough in identifying an underlying essence that is neither physical (as people currently think of the physical), nor [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional]], nor mental, but such that it necessitates all three of these ways in which the mind "appears" to us. The difference between the kind of explanation he rejects and those that he accepts depends on his understanding of [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]]: from his earliest paper to his most recent Nagel has always insisted that a prior context is required to make identity statements plausible, intelligible and transparent.

====Natural selection and consciousness====
{{further|Mind and Cosmos}}
In his 2012 book ''Mind and Cosmos'', Nagel argues against a [[Materialism|materialist]] view of the emergence of life and consciousness, writing that the standard [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view flies in the face of common sense.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} He writes that [[mind]] is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|16ff}} He argues that the principles that account for the emergence of life may be [[teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Despite Nagel's being an atheist and not a proponent of [[intelligent design]] (ID), his book was "praised by [[creationists]]", according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; Nagel writes in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that he disagrees with both ID defenders and their opponents, who argue that the only naturalistic alternative to ID is the current reductionist neo-Darwinian model.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Nagel has argued that ID should not be rejected as non-scientific, for instance writing in 2008 that "ID is very different from [[creation science]]," and that the debate about ID "is clearly a scientific disagreement, not a disagreement between science and something else."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. (2008). "Public education and intelligent design," ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 36(2), pp. 187–205&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he recommended ''[[Signature in the Cell]]'' by the philosopher and ID proponent [[Stephen C. Meyer]] in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' as one of his "Best Books of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article706973.ece|title=Arguments: Thomas Nagel and Stephen C. Meyer’s Signature in the Cell - TLS|publisher=The-tls.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagel does not accept Meyer's conclusions but he endorsed Meyer's approach, and argued in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that Meyer and other ID proponents, [[David Berlinski]] and [[Michael Behe]], "do not deserve the scorn with which they are commonly met."&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

[[Steven Pinker]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] both dismissed the book.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

====Nagel's Rawlsian approach====
Nagel has been highly influential in the related fields of moral and [[political philosophy]]. Supervised by [[John Rawls]], Nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a [[Kantian]] and [[rationalist]] approach to [[moral philosophy]]. His distinctive ideas were first presented in the short [[monograph]] ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' published in 1970. That book seeks by reflection on the nature of [[practical reasoning]] to uncover the formal principles that underlie reason in practice and the related general beliefs about the self that are necessary for those principles to be truly applicable to us. Nagel defends motivated desire theory about the motivation of moral action. According to motivated desire theory, when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire. But it is important to get the justificatory relations right: when a person accepts a moral judgment he or she is necessarily motivated to act. But it is the reason that does the justificatory work of justifying both the action and the desire. Nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification. An account based on presupposing sympathy would be of this kind.

The most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person. When one reasons prudentially, for example about the future reasons that one will have, one allows the reason in the future to justify one's current action without reference to the strength of one's current desires. If a hurricane were to destroy someone's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it: that future reason gives him a reason, now, to take out insurance. The strength of the reason ought not to be hostage to the strength of one's current desires. The denial of this view of prudence, Nagel argues, means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time. One is dissolving oneself into distinct person-stages.

====Altruistic action====
This is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions: in cases of [[altruistic]] action for another person's good that person's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons. Genuine reasons are reasons for anyone. Comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]], Nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one's good as an impersonal good and one's reasons as objective reasons. That means, practically, that a timeless and intrinsic value generates reasons for anyone. A person who denies the truth of this claim is committed, as in the case of a similar mistake about prudence, to a false view of him or herself. In this case the false view is that one's reasons are irreducibly his, in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone: Nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she cannot make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally. Nagel calls this "[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]" and considers it a practical analogue of [[solipsism]] (the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist). Once again, a false view of what is involved in reasoning properly is refuted by showing that it leads to a false view of the nature of people.

====Subjective and objective reasons====
Nagel's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person's personal or "[[Subjectivity|subjective]]" reasons and his or her "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reasons. Earlier, in ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' he took the stance that if one's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then, ''qua'' subjective reason, one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones. In later discussions, Nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values, and speaks instead of "agent-relative" and "agent-neutral" reasons. In the case of agent-relative reasons (the successor to subjective reasons) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to honor his or her parents." By contrast, in the case of agent-neutral reasons (the successor to objective reasons) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to promote the good of parenthood."

====Objective reasons====
The different classes of reasons and values (i.e., agent-relative and agent-neutral) emphasized in Nagel's later work are situated within a Sidgwickian model in which one's moral commitments are thought of objectively, such that one's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole. The structure of Nagel's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself. Those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective, but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated. However, the most striking part of the earlier argument and of Sidgwick's view is preserved: agent-neutral reasons are literally reasons for anyone, so all objectifiable reasons become individually possessed no matter whose they are. Thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint, one must take every other agent's standpoint on value as seriously as one's own, since one's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole; one's personal set of reasons is thus swamped by the objective reasons of all others.

====World agent views====
This is similar to "world agent" [[consequentialist]] views in which one takes up the standpoint of a collective subject whose reasons are those of everyone. But Nagel remains an [[individualist]] who believes in the separateness of persons so his task is to explain why this objective viewpoint does not swallow up the individual standpoint of each of us. He provides an extended rationale for the importance to people of their personal point of view. The result is a hybrid ethical theory of the kind defended by Nagel's Princeton PhD student [[Samuel Scheffler]] in ''The Rejection of Consequentialism''. The objective standpoint and its demands have to be balanced with the subjective personal point of view of each person and its demands. One can always be maximally objective but one does not have to be. One can legitimately "cap" the demands placed on him by the objective reasons of others. In addition, in his later work, Nagel finds a rationale for so-called [[deontic]] constraints in a way Scheffler could not. Following Warren Quinn and Frances Kamm, Nagel grounds them on the [[inviolability]] of persons.

====Political philosophy====
The extent to which one can lead a good life as an individual while respecting the demands of others leads inevitably to political philosophy. In the Locke lectures published as the book ''Equality and Partiality'', Nagel exposes [[John Rawls|John Rawls's]] [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]] to detailed scrutiny. Once again, Nagel places such weight on the objective point of view and its requirements that he finds Rawls's view of liberal equality not demanding enough. Rawls's aim to redress, not remove, the inequalities that arise from class and talent seems to Nagel to lead to a view that does not sufficiently respect the needs of others. He recommends a gradual move to much more demanding conceptions of equality, motivated by the special nature of political responsibility. Normally people draw a distinction between that which people do and that which people fail to bring about. But this thesis, true of individuals, does not apply to the state, which is a collective agent. A Rawlsian state permits intolerable inequalities and people need to develop a more ambitious view of equality to do justice to the demands of the objective recognition of the reasons of others. For Nagel, honoring the objective point of view demands nothing less.

===Experience as a good in itself===
Nagel has said that "''There are elements [of living] which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive.''"&lt;ref&gt;Further; "''Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.''" 'Death' (essay), Thomas Nagel, CUP, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/the-vise-side-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Nagel received the 1996 [[PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay]] for ''Other Minds'' (1995). He has also been awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] in Moral Philosophy (2008), the [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Rolf Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (2008) and the  Distinguished Achievement Award of the [[Mellon Foundation]] (2006).&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66101">In [[logic]] and [[computer science]], '''unification''' is an algorithmic process of [[equation solving|solving equations]] between symbolic [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]].

Depending on which expressions (also called ''terms'') are allowed to occur in an equation set (also called ''unification problem''), and which expressions are considered equal, several frameworks of unification are distinguished. If higher-order variables, that is, variables representing [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, are allowed in an expression, the process is called '''higher-order unification''', otherwise '''first-order unification'''. If a solution is required to make both sides of each equation literally equal, the process is called '''syntactic''' or '''free unification''', otherwise '''semantic''' or '''equational unification''', or '''E-unification''', or '''unification modulo theory'''.

A ''solution'' of a unification problem is denoted as a [[substitution (logic)|substitution]], that is, a mapping assigning a symbolic value to each variable of the problem's expressions. A unification algorithm should compute for a given problem a ''complete'', and ''minimal'' substitution set, that is, a set covering all its solutions, and containing no redundant members. Depending on the framework, a complete and minimal substitution set may have at most one, at most finitely many, or possibly infinitely many members, or may not exist at all.&lt;ref group=note&gt;in this case, still a complete substitution set exists (e.g. the set of all solutions at all); however, each such set contains redundant members.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=François|last1=Fages|first2=Gérard|last2=Huet|title=Complete Sets of Unifiers and Matchers in Equational Theories|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=43|pages=189–200|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90175-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some frameworks it is generally impossible to decide whether any solution exists. For first-order syntactical unification, Martelli and Montanari&lt;ref name="Martelli.Montanari.1982"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alberto|last1=Martelli|first2=Ugo|last2=Montanari|title=An Efficient Unification Algorithm|journal=ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst.|volume=4|number=2|pages=258–282|date=Apr 1982|doi=10.1145/357162.357169}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an algorithm that reports unsolvability or computes a complete and minimal singleton substitution set containing the so-called '''most general unifier'''.

For example, using ''x'',''y'',''z'' as variables, the singleton equation set { ''[[cons]]''(''x'',''cons''(''x'',''[[Lisp (programming language)#Lists|nil]]'')) = ''cons''(2,''y'') } is a syntactic first-order unification problem that has the substitution { ''x'' ↦ 2, ''y'' ↦ ''cons''(2,''nil'') } as its only solution.
The syntactic first-order unification problem { ''y'' = ''cons''(2,''y'') } has no solution over the set of [[term (logic)|finite terms]]; however, it has the single solution { ''y'' ↦ ''cons''(2,''cons''(2,''cons''(2,...))) } over the set of [[Tree (set theory)|infinite trees]].
The semantic first-order unification problem { ''a''⋅''x'' = ''x''⋅''a'' } has each substitution of the form { ''x'' ↦ ''a''⋅...⋅''a'' } as a solution in a [[semigroup]], i.e. if (⋅) is considered [[associative]]; the same problem, viewed in an [[abelian group]], where  (⋅) is considered also [[commutative]], has any substitution at all as a solution.
The singleton set { ''a'' = ''y''(''x'') } is a syntactic second-order unification problem, since ''y'' is a function variable.
One solution is { ''x'' ↦ ''a'', ''y'' ↦ ([[identity function]]) }; another one is { ''y'' ↦ ([[constant function]] mapping each value to ''a''), ''x'' ↦ ''(any value)'' }.

The first formal investigation of unification can be attributed to [[J. Alan Robinson|John Alan Robinson]],&lt;ref name="Robinson.1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.A. Robinson | title=A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle | journal=Journal of the ACM | volume=12 | number=1 | pages=23–41 |date=Jan 1965 | doi=10.1145/321250.321253}}; Here: sect.5.8, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.A. Robinson | title=Computational logic: The unification computation | journal=Machine Intelligence | volume=6 | pages=63–72 | url=http://aitopics.org/sites/default/files/classic/Machine%20Intelligence%206/MI6-Ch4-Robinson.pdf | year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used first-order syntactical unification as a basic building block of his [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] procedure for first-order logic, a great step forward in [[automated reasoning]] technology, as it eliminated one source of combinatorial explosion: searching for instantiation of terms. Today, automated reasoning is still the main application area of unification.
Syntactical first-order unification is used in [[logic programming]] and programming language [[type system]] implementation, especially in [[Hindley–Milner]] based [[type inference]] algorithms.
Semantic unification is used in [[SMT solver]]s, [[term rewriting]] algorithms and [[cryptographic protocol]] analysis.
Higher-order unification is used in proof assistants, for example [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]] and [[Twelf]], and restricted forms of higher-order unification ('''higher-order pattern unification''') are used in some programming language implementations, such as [[lambdaProlog]], as higher-order patterns are expressive, yet their associated unification procedure retains theoretical properties closer to first-order unification.

==Common formal definitions==

===Prerequisites===

Formally, a unification approach presupposes
* An infinite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of '''variables'''. For higher-order unification, it is convenient to choose &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; disjoint from the set of [[Lambda term#Lambda terms|lambda-term bound variables]].
* A set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of '''terms''' such that &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;. For first-order unification and higher-order unification, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is usually the set of [[Term (first-order logic)#Terms|first-order terms]] (terms built from variable and function symbols) and [[Lambda term#Lambda terms|lambda terms]] (terms containing some higher-order variables), respectively.
* A mapping ''vars'': &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [[power set|ℙ]]&lt;math&gt;(V)&lt;/math&gt;, assigning to each term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\text{vars}(t) \subsetneq V&lt;/math&gt; of '''free variables''' occurring in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
* An '''[[equivalence relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, indicating which terms are considered equal. For higher-order unification, usually &lt;math&gt;t\equiv u&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; are [[Lambda term#Alpha equivalence|alpha equivalent]]. For first-order E-unification, &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; reflects the background knowledge about certain function symbols; for example, if &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; is considered commutative, &lt;math&gt;t\equiv u&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; results from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by swapping the arguments of &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; at some (possibly all) occurrences. &lt;ref group=note&gt;E.g. ''a'' ⊕ (''b'' ⊕ ''f''(''x'')) ≡ ''a'' ⊕ (''f''(''x'') ⊕ ''b'') ≡ (''b'' ⊕ ''f''(''x'')) ⊕ ''a'' ≡ (''f''(''x'') ⊕ ''b'') ⊕ ''a''&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no background knowledge at all, then only literally, or syntactically, identical terms are considered equal; in this case, ≡ is called the '''[[free theory]]''' (because it is a [[free object]]), the '''[[empty theory]]''' (because the set of equational [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]], or the background knowledge, is empty), the '''theory of [[uninterpreted function]]s''' (because unification is done on uninterpreted [[term (logic)|terms]]), or the '''theory of [[Algebraic specification|constructors]]''' (because all function symbols just build up data terms, rather than operating on them).

===First-order term===
{{main|Term (logic)}}
Given a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of variable symbols, a set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of constant symbols and sets &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; of ''n''-ary function symbols, also called operator symbols, for each natural number &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the set of (unsorted first-order) terms &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[recursive definition|recursively defined]] to be the smallest set with the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=C.C. Chang |author1link= Chen Chung Chang|author2= H. Jerome Keisler| author2link=Howard Jerome Keisler| title=Model Theory| year=1977| volume=73| publisher=North Holland|  series=Studies in Logic and the Foundation of Mathematics}}; here: Sect.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* every variable symbol is a term: &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;,
* every constant symbol is a term: &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;,
* from every ''n'' terms &lt;math&gt;t_1, ... t_n&lt;/math&gt;, and every ''n''-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f \in F_n&lt;/math&gt;, a larger term &lt;math&gt;f(t_1, ..., t_n)&lt;/math&gt; can be built.
For example, if &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; is a variable symbol, &lt;math&gt;1\in C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol, and &lt;math&gt;\text{add} \in F_2&lt;/math&gt; is a binary function symbol, then &lt;math&gt;x\in T, 1\in T&lt;/math&gt;, and (hence) &lt;math&gt;\text{add}(x, 1) \in T&lt;/math&gt; by the first, second, and third term building rule, respectively. The latter term is usually written as &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;, using [[infix notation]] and the more common operator symbol + for convenience.
&lt;!---move to main article:
Often mathematicians fix the arity (number of arguments) of a function symbol (see [[Signature]]) while typically in syntactic unification problems
a function symbol may have any (finite) number of arguments, and possibly may have different numbers of arguments in different contexts. 
e.g. f(f(a),f(x,y,z)) is a well formed term for unification problems.

===Higher-order term===
{{main|Lambda calculus}}

===Substitution===
{{main|Substitution (logic)}}
A '''substitution''' is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\sigma: V\rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; from variables to terms; the notation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1\mapsto t_1, ..., x_k \mapsto t_k\}&lt;/math&gt; refers to a substitution mapping each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; to the term &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,k&lt;/math&gt;, and every other variable to itself. '''Applying''' that substitution to a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is written in [[postfix notation]] as &lt;math&gt;t \{x_1 \mapsto t_1, ..., x_k \mapsto t_k\}&lt;/math&gt;; it means to (simultaneously) replace every occurrence of each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;. The result &lt;math&gt;t\tau&lt;/math&gt; of applying a substitution &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''instance''' of that term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
As a first-order example, applying the substitution {{math|{{mset| ''x'' ↦ ''h''(''a'',''y''), ''z'' ↦ ''b'' }}}} to the term 
{|
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;f(&lt;/math&gt;
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;, a, g(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{z}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; ), y)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| yields &amp;nbsp;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;f(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{h}(\textbf{a}, \textbf{y})&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;, a, g(&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;), y).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Generalization, specialization===

If a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has an instance equivalent to a term &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;t\sigma \equiv u&lt;/math&gt; for some substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is called '''more general''' than &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is called '''more special''' than, or '''subsumed''' by, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;x\oplus a&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;a\oplus b&lt;/math&gt; if ⊕ is [[Commutative property|commutative]], since then &lt;math&gt;(x\oplus a) \{x\mapsto b\} = b\oplus a\equiv a\oplus b&lt;/math&gt;.

If ≡ is literal (syntactic) identity of terms, a term may be both more general and more special than another one only if both terms differ just in their variable names, not in their syntactic structure; such terms are called '''variants''', or '''renamings''' of each other.
For example, 
&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt;
is a variant of 
&lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2)&lt;/math&gt;,
since 

&lt;!---Templates apparently don't accept "}" and "=" in its argument---&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1) \{x_1 \mapsto x_2, y_1 \mapsto y_2, z_1 \mapsto z_2\} = f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
and 
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(z_2), y_2) \{x_2 \mapsto x_1, y_2 \mapsto y_1, z_2 \mapsto z_1\} = f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
However, &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, a, g(z_1), y_1)&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a variant of  &lt;math&gt;f(x_2, a, g(x_2), x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since no substitution can transform the latter term into the former one.
The latter term is therefore properly more special than the former one.

For arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;, a term may be both more general and more special than a structurally different term.
For example, if ⊕ is [[idempotent]], that is, if always &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \equiv x&lt;/math&gt;, then the term &lt;math&gt;x\oplus y&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref group=note&gt;since &lt;math&gt;(x\oplus y) \{x\mapsto z, y \mapsto z\} = z\oplus z \equiv z&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vice versa,&lt;ref group=note&gt;since {{math|1=''z'' {{mset|''z'' ↦ ''x'' ⊕ ''y''}} = ''x'' ⊕ ''y''}}&lt;/ref&gt; although &lt;math&gt;x\oplus y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are of different structure.

A substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is '''more special''' than, or '''subsumed''' by, a substitution &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is more special than &lt;math&gt;t\tau&lt;/math&gt; for each term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  We also say that &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is more general than &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance &lt;math&gt; \{x \mapsto a, y \mapsto a \}&lt;/math&gt; is more special than &lt;math&gt;\tau = \{x\mapsto y\}&lt;/math&gt;,
but 
&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{x\mapsto a\}&lt;/math&gt; is not,
as &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)\sigma = f(a, y)&lt;/math&gt; is not more special than
&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) \tau = f(y, y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Apt. "From Logic Programming to Prolog", p. 24.  Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unification problem, solution set===

A '''unification problem''' is a finite set {{math|{{mset| ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }}}} of potential equations, where {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''}}.
A substitution σ is a '''solution''' of that problem if {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ ≡ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ}} for &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ..., n&lt;/math&gt;. Such a substitution is also called a '''unifier''' of the unification problem.
For example, if ⊕ is [[Associative property|associative]], the unification problem { ''x'' ⊕ ''a'' ≐ ''a'' ⊕ ''x'' } has the solutions {''x'' ↦ ''a''}, {''x'' ↦ ''a'' ⊕ ''a''}, {''x'' ↦ ''a'' ⊕ ''a'' ⊕ ''a''}, etc., while the problem { ''x'' ⊕ ''a'' ≐ ''a'' } has no solution.

For a given unification problem, a set ''S'' of unifiers is called '''complete''' if each solution substitution is subsumed by some substitution σ ∈ ''S''; the set ''S'' is called '''minimal''' if none of its members subsumes another one.

==Syntactic unification of first-order terms==

[[File:Triangle diagram of syntactic unification svg.svg|thumb|Schematic triangle diagram of syntactically unifying terms ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a substitution σ]]
''Syntactic unification of first-order terms'' is the most widely used unification framework.
It is based on ''T'' being the set of ''first-order terms'' (over some given set ''V'' of variables, ''C'' of constants and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''n''-ary function symbols) and on ≡ being ''syntactic equality''.
In this framework, each solvable unification problem {{math|{{mset|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} has a complete, and obviously minimal, [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] solution set {{math|1={{mset|''σ''}}}}.
Its member {{mvar|σ}} is called the '''most general unifier''' ('''mgu''') of the problem.
The terms on the left and the right hand side of each potential equation become syntactically equal when the mgu is applied i.e. {{math|1=''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' ∧ ... ∧ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''σ'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''σ''}}.
Any unifier of the problem is subsumed&lt;ref group=note&gt;formally: each unifier τ satisfies {{math|1=∀''x'': ''xτ'' = (''xσ'')''ρ''}} for some substitution ρ&lt;/ref&gt; by the mgu {{mvar|σ}}.
The mgu is unique up to variants: if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are both complete and minimal solution sets of the same syntactical unification problem, then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; } and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; } for some substitutions {{math|1=''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} and {{math|1=''xσ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a variant of {{math|1=''xσ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} for each variable ''x'' occurring in the problem.

For example, the unification problem { ''x'' ≐ ''z'', ''y'' ≐ ''f''(''x'') } has a unifier { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }, because
:{|
|-
| align="right" | ''x''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| =
| align="center" | ''z''
| =
| align="right" | ''z''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
|, and
|-
| align="right" | ''y''
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| =
| align="center" | ''f''(''z'')
| =
| align="right" | ''f''(''x'')
| { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''z'') }
| .
|}

This is also the most general unifier.
Other unifiers for the same problem are e.g. { ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)), ''z'' ↦ ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) }, { ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)), ''y'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))), ''z'' ↦ ''f''(''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)) }, and so on; there are infinitely many similar unifiers.

As another example, the problem ''g''(''x'',''x'') ≐ ''f''(''y'') has no solution with respect to ≡ being literal identity, since any substitution applied to the left and right hand side will keep the outermost ''g'' and ''f'', respectively, and terms with different outermost function symbols are syntactically different.

===A unification algorithm===

Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;G = \{ s_1 \doteq t_1, ..., s_n \doteq t_n \}&lt;/math&gt; of potential equations,
the algorithm applies rules to transform it to an equivalent set of equations of the form
{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; }
where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct variables and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are terms containing none of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
A set of this form can be read as a substitution.
If there is no solution the algorithm terminates with ⊥; other authors use "Ω", "{}", or "''fail''" in that case.
The operation of substituting all occurrences of variable ''x'' in problem ''G'' with term ''t'' is denoted ''G'' {''x'' ↦ ''t''}.
For simplicity, constant symbols are regarded as function symbols having zero arguments.

====Occurs check====
{{main|Occurs check}}
An attempt to unify a variable ''x'' with a term containing ''x'' as a strict subterm ''x'' ≐ ''f''(..., ''x'', ...) would lead to an infinite term as solution for ''x'', since ''x'' would occur as a subterm of itself.
In the set of (finite) first-order terms as defined above, the equation ''x'' ≐ ''f''(..., ''x'', ...) has no solution; hence the ''eliminate'' rule may only be applied if ''x'' ∉ ''vars''(''t'').
Since that additional check, called ''occurs check'', slows down the algorithm, it is omitted e.g. in most Prolog systems.
From a theoretical point of view, omitting the check amounts to solving equations over infinite trees, see [[#Unification of infinite terms|below]].

====Proof of termination====
For the proof of termination of the algorithm consider a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle n_{var}, n_{lhs}, n_{eqn}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of variables that occur more than once in the equation set, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of function symbols and constants
on the left hand sides of potential equations, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''eqn''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of equations.
When rule ''eliminate'' is applied, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} decreases, since ''x'' is eliminated from ''G'' and kept only in { ''x'' ≐ ''t'' }.
Applying any other rule can never increase {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''var''&lt;/sub&gt;}} again.
When rule ''decompose'', ''conflict'', or ''swap'' is applied, {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}} decreases, since at least the left hand side's outermost ''f'' disappears.
Applying any of the remaining rules ''delete'' or ''check'' can't increase {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''lhs''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but decreases {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''eqn''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Hence, any rule application decreases the triple &lt;math&gt;\langle n_{var}, n_{lhs}, n_{eqn}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[lexicographical order]], which is possible only a finite number of times.

===Examples of syntactic unification of first-order terms===
In the Prolog syntactical convention a symbol starting with an upper case letter is a variable name; a symbol that starts with a lowercase letter is a function symbol; the comma is used as the logical ''and'' operator.
For mathematical notation, ''x,y,z'' are used as variables, ''f,g'' as function symbols, and ''a,b'' as constants.

[[File:Unification exponential blow-up svg.svg|thumb|Two terms with an exponentially larger tree for their least common instance. Its [[directed acyclic graph|dag]] representation (rightmost, orange part) is still of linear size.]]
The most general unifier of a syntactic first-order unification problem of [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|size]] {{mvar|n}} may have a size of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For example, the problem {{tmath| (((a*z)*y)*x)*w \doteq w*(x*(y*(z*a))) }} has the most general unifier {{tmath| z \mapsto a,  y \mapsto a*a,  x \mapsto (a*a)*(a*a),  w \mapsto ((a*a)*(a*a))*((a*a)*(a*a)) }}, cf. picture. In order to avoid exponential time complexity caused by such blow-up, advanced unification algorithms work on [[directed acyclic graph]]s (dags) rather than trees.{{refn|e.g. Paterson, Wegman (1978),&lt;ref name="Paterson.Wegman.1978"/&gt; sect.2, p.159}}

===Application: unification in logic programming===

The concept of unification is one of the main ideas behind [[logic programming]], best known through the language [[Prolog]]. It represents the mechanism of binding the contents of variables and can be viewed as a kind of one-time assignment. In Prolog, this operation is denoted by the equality symbol &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, but is also done when instantiating variables (see below). It is also used in other languages by the use of the equality symbol &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, but also in conjunction with many operations including &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. [[Type inference]] algorithms are typically based on unification.

In Prolog:
# A [[variable (programming)|variable]] which is uninstantiated—i.e. no previous unifications were performed on it—can be unified with an atom, a term, or another uninstantiated variable, thus effectively becoming its alias. In many modern Prolog dialects and in [[first-order logic]], a variable cannot be unified with a term that contains it; this is the so-called ''[[occurs check]]''.
# Two atoms can only be unified if they are identical.
# Similarly, a term can be unified with another term if the top function symbols and [[Arity|arities]] of the terms are identical and if the parameters can be unified simultaneously. Note that this is a recursive behavior.

=== Application: type inference ===

Unification is used during type inference, for instance in the functional programming language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. On one hand, the programmer does not need to provide type information for every function, on the other hand it is used to detect typing errors. The Haskell expression &lt;code&gt;True : ['a', 'b', 'c']&lt;/code&gt; is not correctly typed. The list construction function &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, and for the first argument &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; the polymorphic type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has to be unified with &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;'s type, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;. The second argument, &lt;code&gt;['a', 'b', 'c']&lt;/code&gt;, is of type &lt;code&gt;[Char]&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; cannot be both &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.

Like for Prolog, an algorithm for type inference can be given:

# Any type variable unifies with any type expression, and is instantiated to that expression.  A specific theory might restrict this rule with an occurs check.
# Two type constants unify only if they are the same type.
# Two type constructions unify only if they are applications of the same type constructor and all of their component types recursively unify.

Due to its declarative nature, the order in a sequence of unifications is (usually) unimportant.

Note that in the terminology of [[first-order logic]], an atom is a basic proposition and is unified similarly to a Prolog term.

==Order-sorted unification==
''[[Many-sorted logic#Order-sorted logic|Order-sorted logic]]'' allows one to assign a ''sort'', or ''type'', to each term, and to declare a sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; a ''subsort'' of another sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, commonly written as ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, when reаsoning about biological creatures, it is useful to declare a sort ''dog'' to be a subsort of a sort ''animal''. Wherever a term of some sort ''s'' is required, a term of any subsort of ''s'' may be supplied instead.
For example, assuming a function declaration ''mother'': ''animal'' → ''animal'', and a constant declaration ''lassie'': ''dog'', the term  ''mother''(''lassie'') is perfectly valid and has the sort ''animal''. In order to supply the information that the mother of a dog is a dog in turn, another declaration ''mother'': ''dog'' → ''dog'' may be issued; this is called ''function overloading'', similar to [[Overloading (programming)|overloading in programming languages]].

[[Christoph Walther|Walther]] gave a unification algorithm for terms in order-sorted logic, requiring for any two declared sorts ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; their intersection ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be declared, too: if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable of sort ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, the equation ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≐ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the solution { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'' }, where ''x'': ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christoph|last1=Walther|authorlink=Christoph Walther|title=A Mechanical Solution of Schubert's Steamroller by Many-Sorted Resolution|journal=Artif. Intell.|volume=26|number=2|pages=217–224|url=http://www.inferenzsysteme.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/media/is/publikationen/Schuberts_Steamroller_by_Many-Sorted_Resolution-AIJ-25-2-1985.pdf|year=1985|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(85)90029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After incorporating this algorithm into a clause-based automated theorem prover, he could solve a benchmark problem by translating it into order-sorted logic, thereby boiling it down an order of magnitude, as many unary predicates turned into sorts.

Smolka generalized order-sorted logic to allow for [[parametric polymorphism]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Gert|last1=Smolka|title=Logic Programming with Polymorphically Order-Sorted Types|conference=Int. Workshop Algebraic and Logic Programming|publisher=Springer|series=LNCS|volume=343|pages=53–70|date=Nov 1988|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-50667-5_58.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his framework, subsort declarations are propagated to complex type expressions.
As a programming example, a parametric sort ''list''(''X'') may be declared (with ''X'' being a type parameter as in a [[Template (C++)#Function templates|C++ template]]), and from a subsort declaration ''int'' ⊆ ''float'' the relation ''list''(''int'') ⊆ ''list''(''float'') is automatically inferred, meaning that each list of integers is also a list of floats.

Schmidt-Schauß generalized order-sorted logic to allow for term declarations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Manfred|last1=Schmidt-Schauß|title=Computational Aspects of an Order-Sorted Logic with Term Declarations|publisher=Springer|series=LNAI|volume=395|date=Apr 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an example, assuming subsort declarations ''even'' ⊆ ''int'' and ''odd'' ⊆ ''int'', a term declaration like ∀ ''i'' : ''int''. (''i'' + ''i'') : ''even'' allows to declare a property of integer addition that could not be expressed by ordinary overloading.

==E-unification==

'''E-unification''' is the problem of finding solutions to a given set of [[equations]],
taking into account some equational background knowledge ''E''.
The latter is given as a set of universal [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]].
For some particular sets ''E'', equation solving [[algorithms]] (a.k.a. ''E-unification algorithms'') have been devised;
for others it has been proven that no such algorithms can exist.

For example, if {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are distinct constants,
the [[equation]] {{tmath|x * a \doteq y * b}} has no solution
with respect to purely [[Unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification problem on first-order terms|syntactic unification]],
where nothing is known about the operator {{tmath|*}}.
However, if the {{tmath|*}} is known to be [[Commutativity|commutative]],
then the substitution {{math|{{mset|''x'' ↦ ''b'', ''y'' ↦ ''a''}}}} solves the above equation,
since
:{|
|
| {{tmath|x * a}}

|-
| {{=}}
| {{tmath|y * b}}
| {{math|{{mset|''x'' ↦ ''b'', ''y'' ↦ ''a''}}}}
| by (converse) substitution application
|}
The background knowledge ''E'' could state the commutativity of {{tmath|*}} by the universal equality
"{{tmath|1=u * v = v * u}} for all {{math|''u'', ''v''}}".

It is said that ''unification is [[Decidable problem#Decidability|semi-decidable]]'' for a theory, if a unification algorithm has been devised for it that terminates for any ''solvable'' input problem, but may keep searching forever for solutions of an unsolvable input problem.

Starting with ''G'' being the unification problem to be solved and ''S'' being the identity substitution, rules are applied nondeterministically until the empty set appears as the actual ''G'', in which case the actual ''S'' is a unifying substitution. Depending on the order the paramodulation rules are applied, on the choice of the actual equation from ''G'', and on the choice of ''R''’s rules in ''mutate'', different computations paths are possible. Only some lead to a solution, while others end at a ''G'' ≠ {} where no further rule is applicable (e.g. ''G'' = { ''f''(...) ≐ ''g''(...) }).

|}

For an example, a term rewrite system ''R'' is used defining the ''append'' operator of lists built from ''cons'' and ''nil''; where ''cons''(''x'',''y'') is written in infix notation as ''x''.''y'' for brevity; e.g. ''app''(''a''.''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''app''(''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''b''.''app''(''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') → ''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'' demonstrates the concatenation of the lists ''a''.''b''.''nil'' and ''c''.''d''.''nil'', employing the rewrite rule 2,2, and 1. The equational theory ''E'' corresponding to ''R'' is the [[Closure (mathematics)#P closures of binary relations|congruence closure]] of ''R'', both viewed as binary relations on terms.
For example, ''app''(''a''.''b''.''nil'',''c''.''d''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'' ≡ ''app''(''a''.''b''.''c''.''d''.''nil'',''nil''). The paramodulation algorithm enumerates solutions to equations with respect to that ''E'' when fed with the example ''R''.

A successful example computation path for the unification problem { ''app''(''x'',''app''(''y'',''x'')) ≐ ''a''.''a''.''nil'' } is shown below. To avoid variable name clashes, rewrite rules are consistently renamed each time before their use by rule ''mutate''; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are computer-generated variable names for this purpose. In each line, the chosen equation from ''G'' is highlighted in red. Each time the ''mutate'' rule is applied, the chosen rewrite rule (''1'' or ''2'') is indicated in parentheses. From the last line, the unifying substitution ''S'' = { ''y'' ↦ ''nil'', ''x'' ↦  ''a''.''nil'' } can be obtained. In fact,
''app''(''x'',''app''(''y'',''x'')) {''y''↦''nil'', ''x''↦ ''a''.''nil'' } = ''app''(''a''.''nil'',''app''(''nil'',''a''.''nil'')) ≡ ''app''(''a''.''nil'',''a''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''app''(''nil'',''a''.''nil'') ≡ ''a''.''a''.''nil'' solves the given problem.
A second successful computation path, obtainable by choosing "mutate(1), mutate(2), mutate(2), mutate(1)" leads to the substitution ''S'' = { ''y'' ↦ ''a''.''a''.''nil'', ''x'' ↦ ''nil'' }; it is not shown here. No other path leads to a success.

===Narrowing===

[[File:Triangle diagram of narrowing step svg.svg|thumb|Triangle diagram of narrowing step ''s'' ~› ''t'' at position ''p'' in term ''s'', with unifying substitution σ (bottom row), using a rewrite rule {{math|1=''l'' → ''r''}} (top row)]]
If ''R'' is a [[Term rewriting#Termination and convergence|convergent term rewriting system]] for ''E'',
an approach alternative to the previous section consists in successive application of "'''narrowing steps'''";
this will eventually enumerate all solutions of a given equation.
A narrowing step (cf. picture) consists in
* choosing a nonvariable subterm of the current term,
* [[#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|syntactically unifying]] it with the left hand side of a rule from ''R'', and
* replacing the instantiated rule's right hand side into the instantiated term.
Formally, if {{math|''l'' → ''r''}} is a [[Term (logic)#Structural equality|renamed copy]] of a rewrite rule from ''R'', having no variables in common with a term ''s'', and the [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] {{math|''s''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not a variable and is unifiable with {{mvar|l}} via the [[#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|mgu]] {{mvar|σ}}, then {{mvar|s}} can be '''narrowed''' to the term {{math|1=''t'' = ''sσ''[''rσ'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. to the term {{mvar|sσ}}, with the subterm at ''p'' [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|replaced]] by {{mvar|rσ}}. The situation that ''s'' can be narrowed to ''t'' is commonly denoted as ''s'' ~› ''t''.
Intuitively, a sequence of narrowing steps ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~› ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~› ... ~› ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as a sequence of rewrite steps ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ... → ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but with the initial term ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being further and further instantiated, as necessary to make each of the used rules applicable.

The [[#One-sided paramodulation|above]] example paramodulation computation corresponds to the following narrowing sequence ("↓" indicating instantiation here):

{|
|-
| ''app''( || ''x'' || ,''app''(''y'', || ''x'' || ))
|-

|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||  ↓  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||    ||  ||  ''y'' ↦ ''nil''
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''app''( || ''nil'' || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))  ||  →  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''( || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. || ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || )
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||     ||             ||                   ||           ||  ↓  ||   ||  ↓  ||  ||  ||  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''nil''
|-
|     ||         ||         ||         ||     ||                   ||                   ||     ||             ||                   ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''app''( || ''nil'' || ,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. || ''nil'' || )  ||  →  ||  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''nil''
|}

The last term, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''nil'' can be syntactically unified with the original right hand side term ''a''.''a''.''nil''.

The ''narrowing lemma''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Fay| chapter=First-Order Unification in an Equational Theory| title=Proc. 4th Workshop on Automated Deduction| year=1979| pages=161–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that whenever an instance of a term ''s'' can be rewritten to a term ''t'' by a convergent term rewriting system, then ''s'' and ''t'' can be narrowed and rewritten to a term {{math|1=''s''’}} and {{math|1=''t''’}}, respectively, such that {{math|1=''t''’}} is an instance of {{math|1=''s''’}}.

Formally: whenever {{math|1=''sσ'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|&amp;rarr;}} ''t''}} holds for some substitution σ, then there exist terms {{math|''s''’, ''t''’}} such that {{math|''s'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|~›}} ''s''’}} and {{math|''t'' {{underset|&amp;lowast;|&amp;rarr;}} ''t''’}} and {{math|1=''s''’''τ'' = ''t''’}} for some substitution τ.

==Higher-order unification==

Many applications require one to consider the unification of typed lambda-terms instead of first-order terms.  Such unification is often called ''higher-order unification''.  A well studied branch of higher-order unification is the problem of unifying simply typed lambda terms modulo the equality determined by αβη conversions.  Such unification problems do not have most general unifiers.  While higher-order unification is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Warren D.

Huet&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=695200 Gérard Huet: Higher Order Unification 30 Years Later]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gilles Dowek&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Dowek: Higher-Order Unification and Matching. Handbook of Automated Reasoning 2001: 1009–1062&lt;/ref&gt; have written articles surveying this topic.

[[Dale Miller (computer scientist)|Dale Miller]] has described what is now called ''higher-order pattern unification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dale|last1=Miller|title=A Logic Programming Language with Lambda-Abstraction, Function Variables, and Simple Unification|journal=Journal of Logic and Computation|year=1991|pages=497–536|url=http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/papers/jlc91.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subset of higher-order unification is decidable and solvable unification problems have most-general unifiers.  Many computer systems that contain higher-order unification, such as the higher-order logic programming languages [[λProlog]] and [[Twelf]], often implement only the pattern fragment and not full higher-order unification.

In computational linguistics, one of the most influential theories of [[Elliptical construction|ellipsis]] is that ellipses are represented by free variables whose values are then determined using Higher-Order Unification (HOU). For instance, the semantic representation of "Jon likes Mary and Peter does too" is  {{math| like(''j'', ''m'') &amp;and; R(''p'') }} and the value of R (the semantic representation of the ellipsis) is determined by the equation {{math| like(''j'', ''m'') {{=}} R(''j'')  }}. The process of solving such equations is called Higher-Order Unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Claire | last1 = Gardent | first2 = Michael | last2 = Kohlhase | first3 = Karsten | last3 = Konrad | author2link=Michael Kohlhase| chapter=A Multi-Level, Higher-Order Unification Approach to Ellipsis| title=Submitted to European [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (EACL)&lt;!---according to http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/cbenzmueller/papers/R8.pdf---&gt;| year=1997| volume=| pages=| publisher=| editor=| series=|citeseerx = 10.1.1.55.9018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the unification problem { ''f''(''a'',  ''b'', ''a'') ≐ ''d''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'') }, where the only variable is ''f'', has the
solutions {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''x'', ''c'')  }, {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''z'', ''c'')  },
{''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''y'', ''a'', ''c'')  }, {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''x'', ''c'')  },
{''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''z'', ''c'')  } and {''f'' ↦ λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''d''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'')  }.

[[Wayne Snyder]] gave a generalization of both higher-order unification and E-unification, i.e. an algorithm to unify lambda-terms modulo an equational theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wayne Snyder | contribution=Higher order E-unification | title=Proc. 10th [[Conference on Automated Deduction]] | publisher=Springer | series=LNAI | volume=449 | pages=573–587 |date=Jul 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victimisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''victimization''') is the process of being victimised or becoming a [[wikt:victim|victim]]. The field that studies the process, rates, incidence, effects, and prevalence of victimisation is called [[victimology]].

Peer victimisation is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behaviour of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hawker D.S.J. |author2=Boulton M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimisation and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 441–455 | doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary Victimization==
===Prevalence===
Secondary victimization (also known as post crime victimization &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  or double victimization &lt;ref&gt;Doerner, William (2012). Victimology. Burlington, MA: Elseiver, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-4377-3486-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to further victim-blaming from criminal justice authorities following a report of an original victimization. &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of victimization are high, with an estimated 5.7 million individuals experiencing at least one victimization in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics. (2016). Criminal victimization. U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these are cases of criminal offenses, the reported rates of violent victimization are disproportionately low. Less than half (42%) report any violent crime of threatened or real force, such as physical assault, battery, or weapons offenses. Additionally, under a quarter (23%) report rape, childhood, or sexual assault to the police. Further, out of the portion that does report sexual assault or rape, about half describe the experience as upsetting, frustrating, and useless.&lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to increase criminal reports of victimization, authorities and law enforcement personnel often discount individuals’ violent experiences and fail to attend to both the necessary legal actions and interpersonal actions. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
When institutions or criminal justice system personnel fail to support the victimized individual, victims are vulnerable to secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; While the appropriate and legal way to respond to primary victimization is to report the event, authorities often deny, do not believe, or blame the victim (Campbell &amp; Raja, 1999; Campbell &amp; Raja, 2005). In turn, up to 90% of victims report experiencing negative social reaction and attribute the incident as a “second rape” or “second assault” &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Research suggests that victim of sexual violence or assault are the least likely to receive support or resources following reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to perceived lack of evidence, social stigma, and overall discomfort when dealing with sexual incidences. In a study of rape victims undergoing prosecution for their assault, those who felt their detectives responded empathetically and with understanding were likelier to pursue prosecution, felt their experiences were important, and their cases deserved to be heard. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Empathetic and supportive responses from authorities could potentially improve mental and physical health in rape survivors and additionally, improve reporting rates and lessen judgmental attitudes from the criminal justice system. Because sexual violence is a sensitive subject for all parties, criminal justice personnel may avoid, ignore, or publicly misconstrue their opinions about the situation as an effort to separate themselves or cope with dangerous and uncomfortable situations. Studies suggest these misconceptions by the system may further damage individuals’ mental health and a safer world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; This could be combatted with accepting, non-accusatory perspectives, aiding in accuracy the sexual violence reports. Several authors speculate authorities’ supportive approach benefits the victim and promotes a just world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stromwall, L.A., Alfredsson, H., &amp; Landstrom, S. (2013). Blame attributions and rape: Effects of belief in a just world and relationship level. Legal and Criminological Psychology, 18, 254-261. &lt;/ref&gt; In this way, previous victims might report and seek appropriate resources in the future.

Those exposed to traumatic victimization are vulnerable to experiencing secondary victimization. If social needs such as empathy, support, and understanding are not met, individuals are prone to this phenomenon. While anybody who has experienced victimization is susceptible to secondary victimization, prevalence rates are significantly elevated for some populations. This includes females, children, racial and sexual minorities, and those sexually assaulted by an acquaintance or stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M.A., Valentine, S.E., Woodward, E.N., &amp; Pantalone, D.W. (2017). Secondary victimization of sexual minority men following disclosure of sexual assault: ‘Victimizing me all over again…’. Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy, 14, 275-288. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, those experiencing a certain type of violence are at increased likelihood to experience secondary victimization. These include physical assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence &lt;ref&gt;Laing, L. (2017). Secondary victimization: Domestic violence survivors navigating the family law system. Violence Against Women, 23, 1314-1335. &lt;/ref&gt; Notably, rape victims are at highest risk of secondary victimization from the criminal justice system, with about half who report describing the process as distressing. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting Victimization===
As a consequence of social rejections and insensitivities to acknowledging trauma or violence, individuals are increasingly apt to continue not reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt; This can be detrimental to victims’ mental health, as sexual violence often happens more than once and not reporting violence helps to maintain a repeated cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing violence is associated with negative mental and physical outcomes, including shame, emotion dysregulation, psychological stress, loss of resources, and mental health pathology. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis about sexual assault victimization and psychopathology, there was a medium-sized effect overall effect size was moderate after accounting for several mental health diagnoses including depression, anxiety, suicidality, disordered eating, and substance abuse. &lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that sexual assault victimization is significantly related to mental health distress even after controlling for other associated symptoms. Additionally, women who experience secondary victimization are likelier to have both adverse physical health and mental health implications and are also unlikely to seek services and treatment. &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Given these individuals are likely in a troubled state, pressures of reporting are cognitively taxing. To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report. This is not only harmful to the individual, but to society, in that perpetrators are thus permitted to continue committing crimes and abuse. As a consequence of victim-blaming and other negative attitudes towards victims, reported rates of criminal abuse are low and distress in victims is high. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with Criminal Justice System===
Despite high rates of secondary victimization, reporting rates are low. It is not unusual for criminal justice personnel to discourage victims from prosecuting their sexual assault cases due to victim-blaming behaviors and discounting victims’ traumatic experiences. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Wasco, S.M., Ahrens, C.E., Sefl, T., &amp; Barnes, H.E. (2001). Preventing the “Second Rape”: Rape survivors’ experiences with community service providers. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 12, 1239-1259. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt; One incident that attracts much controversy in the criminal justice system is reporting violent crimes on one’s intimate partner. Women who report rape by an intimate partner are seen as less credible by the system and law enforcement are more likely to encourage dropping the case. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal standards of obeying an intimate partner and thus encompassing rape culture are prevalent in the criminal justice system. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is a legal crime that is being reported, victims are often turned away feeling alienated, hopeless, and unworthy and have limited options for resources beyond the system. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragmented Memory===
A possible explanation of why the criminal justice system is unlikely to believe many victims is due to victims’ fragmented memory. It is not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse to also have a traumatic brain injury or other neurobiological reactions due to assault. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Campbell explains how molecular changes occur in response to trauma, and how this can influence discrepancies in victims’ reports and recollections of the event. After a traumatic incident, chemical alterations in the brain change, impacting encoding and processing the memory &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Not only do neurobiological changes affect victims’ memories, but emotion dysregulation, repression, suppression, dissociation, and avoidance of the event are also common reactions in victims &lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, E., Clark, D.M., &amp; Ehlers, A. (2001). A prospective investigation of the role of cognitive factors in persistent Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after physical or sexual assault. Behavior Research and Therapy, 39, 1063-1084. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ehlers, A., &amp; Clark, D. M. (2000). A cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38, 319–345. doi:10.1016/s0005-7967(99)00123-0&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitive and neurobiological factors are rarely considered when a victim reports an assault. &lt;ref&gt;Venema, R.M. (2016). Police officer schema of sexual assault reports. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 31, 872-899. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt;. During the time law enforcement personnel gather information about the event, they could be met with victims explaining their stories inconsistently due to a fragmented memory. Either by a neurobiological change or psychological response to particularly distressing trauma, victims may fall prey to the inability to coherently portray details of the event, thus taking away credibility and facilitating secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revictimisation==
The term '''revictimisation''' refers to a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter&lt;ref name="Finkelhor-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Finkelhor | first1 = D. | last2 = Ormrod | first2 = RK. | last3 = Turner | first3 = HA. | title = Re-victimization patterns in a national longitudinal sample of children and youth | journal = Child Abuse Negl | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–502 |date=May 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.012 | pmid = 17537508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child.  This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Assault Revictimization |journal=Research &amp; Advocacy Digest |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=1 |first=Janet|last=Anderson|publisher=The Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(96)00019-0|title=Child Sexual Abuse and its Relationship to Revictimization in Adult Women|author1=Messman Terri L. |author2=Long Patricia J. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397–420|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of revictimisation for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high.  The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include [[Domestic violence|physical abuse]] as well.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Reasons as to why revictimisation occurs vary by event type, and some mechanisms are unknown.  Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Revictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is "normal" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve, it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.&lt;ref name=messman/&gt;  One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].

== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==

In adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | url = | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635–648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.

==Self-victimisation==
{{Main|Victim playing}}
Self-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].

==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==
{{Main|Victim mentality}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of victimisation in United States==
Levels of criminal activity are measured through three major data sources: the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR), self-report surveys of criminal offenders, and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS). However, the UCR and self-report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries. The NCVS is a tool used to measure the existence of actual, rather than only those reported, crimes—the victimisation rate&lt;ref name="NCVS"&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm National Crime Victimization Survey Official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;—by asking individuals about incidents in which they may have been victimised. The National Crime Victimization Survey is the [[United States]]' primary source of information on crime victimisation.

Each year, data is obtained from a nationally represented sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimisation in the United States.  This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimisation by [[Rape]] (more valid estimates were calculated after the surveys redesign in 1992 that better tapped instances of sexual assault, particularly of [[Date rape]]),&lt;ref name=Doerner&gt;{{cite book|last=Doerner|first=William|title=Victimology|year=2012|publisher=Elseiver, Inc.|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1-4377-3486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robbery]], [[assault]], [[theft]], household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; Property crimes continue to decline.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt;

In 2010, the [[National Institute of Justice]] reported that American adolescents were the age group most likely to be victims of violent crime, while American men were more likely than American women to be victims of violent crime, and blacks were more likely than Americans of other races to be victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="NIJ2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/victims-victimization/welcome.htm | title=Victims and Victimization | date=20 September 2010 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In employment law==
Victimisation is a concept in [[employment law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= This section provides general information on employment law in the UK|publisher=UK Film Council|year=2009|url= http://www.diversitytoolkit.org.uk/workinginfilm/employmentlaw/discriminationlaw/harassment/|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yellow grease''', also termed '''used cooking oil''' ('''UCO'''), '''used vegetable oil''' ('''UVO'''), '''recycled vegetable oil''', or '''waste vegetable oil''' ('''WVO''') is recovered from businesses and industry that use the [[cooking oil|oil for cooking]].

It is used to feed livestock, and to manufacture [[soap]], make-up, clothes, rubber, and detergents.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Denis J. ''Plant lipids: biology, utilization, and manipulation''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to competition from these other industrial sectors, the [[Energy Information Administration|EIA]] estimates that less than a third of yellow grease could be spared for [[biodiesel]] production annually.&lt;ref&gt;Radich, Anthony [http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/biodiesel/ ''Biodiesel Performance, Costs, and Use'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinct from [[brown grease]]; yellow grease is typically used [[Cooking oil|frying oils]] from [[deep fryers]], whereas brown grease is sourced from [[grease interceptor|grease interceptors]].&lt;ref name='pub32'&gt;[http://www.nrbp.org/pdfs/pub32.pdf Brown Grease Feedstocks for Biodiesel].  K. Shaine Tyson, National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Available from [[Northeast Regional Biomass Program]].  Retrieved January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Yellow grease can also refer to lower-quality grades of [[tallow]] (cow or sheep fat) from [[Rendering (animal products)|animal rendering]] plants.  

The term has been in use for some time. A source from 1896 describes it as follows: "Yellow grease is made by packers. All the refuse materials of the packing houses go into the yellow grease tank, together with any hogs which may die on the packers' hands."&lt;ref&gt;Brannt, William Theodore and Schaedlerm Karl.

H.C. Baird, 1896, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;
