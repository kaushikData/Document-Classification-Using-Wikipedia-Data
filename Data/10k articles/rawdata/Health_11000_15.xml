The '''Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia''' (ANSA) is a non-profit professional organization for applied [[neuroscience]] in Australia, with members in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. 

It is established in 2007, following an amalgamation of AAAPB (Australian Association of Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback) and Australian Chapter of the ISNR (International Society for Neuronal Regulation).  

Members include clinicians and researchers. They comprise [[psychologists]], [[psychiatrists]], [[pediatricians]], behavioral [[optometrists]], speech therapists, trainers and other professionals who have a university degree, appropriate clinical training as well as registration with their professional board. 

The aim of the society is to promote expertise and high [[professional standards|standards]] in the optimization of brain functioning through the application of knowledge in [[brain science]], [[nutrition]], [[psychology]] and [[medicine]].

Many members are practitioners or researchers of [[biofeedback]] and [[neurofeedback]].  Their interests include the non-medication treatment of developmental disorders (e.g. [[ADHD]], [[dyslexia]], [[learning disorders]], [[behavioural problems]]), [[psychiatric disorders]], as well as [[performance improvement]] for the normal individuals. 

The Society maintains a close relationship with related international societies, including the [[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]], [[International Society for Neurofeedback and Research]], and the [[Biofeedback Foundation of Europe]]. 

It holds an annual Conference, Annual Workshops with invited international speakers, as well as skill training workshops during the year.

International speakers for the 2014 Annual Conference and Workshops include [[Dirk De Ridder (neurosurgeon)|Dirk De Ridder]] M.D., PhD, Robert W. Thatcher PhD., and Randy Beck PhD.

'''Audrey Juliet Arnott''' (1901–1974) was a [[medical illustrator]] who worked with the neurosurgeon [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]] at the [[London Hospital]] and followed him to Oxford when he was appointed Nuffield Professor of Surgery in 1939. She founded the Medical Artists’ Association of Great Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompsett|first=D. H.|title=The Medical Artists' Association Of Great Britain|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=28 January 1950|volume=1|issue=4647|pages=251–252|jstor=25374955|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4647.251-c}}&lt;/ref&gt; from her home in [[Wolvercote]] in 1949.

==Training==
When Audrey Arnott graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]], she was employed by Hugh Cairns as an artist. The surgeon arranged for Arnott to be trained at the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig as a medical illustrator under [[Max Brödel]], founder of the first 'Department of Art as Applied to Medicine' at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1911. Brödel taught Arnott the technique of drawing on Ross-board with [[carbon dust]], a method which Arnott later passed onto other British medical illustrators. As Arnott was the only British student of Brödel, she is credited with introducing the technique to United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="JVCM"/&gt;

==Career==
Arnott accompanied Cairns to the [[University of Oxford]] when he opened the neurosurgical department there in 1939. During her time there she produced a number of neurosurgical illustrations for Hugh Cairns, using the Ross-board and carbon dust technique taught to her by Brödel. Her illustrations have been regarded as showing the clarity of black and white photography, intricate in their anatomical, surgical, and pathological detail whilst maintaining a unique artistic style.&lt;ref name="JVCM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Reuben D.|author2=Willow J. Sainsbury|title=Audrey Juliet Arnott (1901‐1974): The Legacy of an Artist in Neurosurgery|journal=Journal of Visual Communication in Medicine|year=2009|volume=32|issue=3-4|pages=88–90|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17453050903402853|doi=10.3109/17453050903402853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Within the United Kingdom, Arnott was highly influential in the field of medical illustration, training numerous artists in the Ross-board technique, including [[Margaret McLarty]] (medical artist for the anaesthetic department). McLarty's later publication ''Illustrating Medicine and Surgery'' became a core text for medical illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLarty|first=M.|title=Illustrating Medicine and Surgery|year=1960|publisher=E&amp;S Livingstone Ltd|location=Edinburgh and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnott and McLarty, with two other illustrators, founded the Medical Artists Association of Great Britain on 2 April 1949. The foundation acted as a professional body for medical artists and raise the standard of medical art through training, education and examinations.

The '''Baum test''', (also known as the "Tree test" or, in other countries, the "Koch test") is a [[projective test]] developed by Swiss psychologist Charles Koch in 1952. It is used extensively across the world {{By whom|date=September 2017}} as a method of analyzing an individual’s [[personality]] and underlying emotional history.

Patients are asked to draw a broad-leaved tree on a standard 8.5″ × 11″ blank sheet of paper. A [[psychologist]] or a [[psychiatrist]] will then evaluate the different aspects of the tree drawing as well as the individual’s behavior /comments while completing the test.

A tree is selected as the object to be drawn because trees serve as an important element in mythologies all over the world. Additionally, trees are a nonthreatening element that allow for a wide range of adaptation. It is suggested {{By whom|date=September 2017}} that the type of tree an individual draws relates to the structure of the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] or [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] itself.

==Forms of analysis==
Two forms of analysis are used to evaluate and interpret the Baum test. The global structure analysis views the tree as a whole, such the tree’s overall size and location on the paper. The internal structure analysis focuses on the finer details of the tree. There are 59 detail oriented aspects of the tree drawing that are used to evaluate an individual's thoughts or feelings including roots, trunk, branches, crown, leaves, knots, shading, symmetry, [[archetype|archetypal]] features etc.

==Advantages and limitations==
Advantages of the Baum test are that it can be administered quickly (usually 5–10 minutes), to a wide range of individuals, and it offers the clinician an opportunity to observe the patients [[motor skills]].

Limitations of the Baum test are that it cannot be scored objectively. “One problem concerning the validity of the drawing technique is that researchers choose procedures that will no doubt result in nonsignificant findings. For example, they isolate one or a few indices from a figure drawing rating scale, taken completely out of context, and then attempt to correlate these indices with measure they view as excellent criterion variables, such as self-report inventories.”{{Cite quote|date=April 2014}} Additionally, the test typically not used on patients with very low [[IQ]]s because their drawings tend to be quite meager.

==Indications==
*Large Baum: indicates [[self-confidence]]
*Small Baum: indicates a lack of self-confidence
*Big trunk: indicates straightforwardness and liveliness
*Small trunk: indicates [[weariness]]
*Deep Roots: indicates stability
*No Roots/Shallow roots: indicates a feeling of [[social exclusion|exclusion]]
*No Branches/Small Branches: indicates unsocial behavior
*Big Branches: indicates arrogance
*Large Leaves: indicates friendliness, social ability
*Small Leaves: indicates shyness

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">'''Bird kill''' is a localized event resulting in the death of large numbers of birds at the same time.

==Scientific explanations==

Large die offs of animals are not unusual in nature, and happen for a variety of reasons including bad weather, disease, and poisonings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birds Falling From the Sky Not Unusual| date = 6 January 2011 | url = http://news.discovery.com/animals/bird-animal-die-offs-110106.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pollution and [[climate change]] adding to the stresses on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCIENCE NEWS Mass bird deaths rare, not apocalyptic: experts
| url = http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre70534t-us-deaths/|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in the US over the past 10 years 175 mass deaths events exceeding 1,000 birds occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black-bird die-off Investigation|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/science_feature/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian scientist [[Afanasiy Ilich Tobonov]] researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the [[Sakha Republic]] were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Group - Afanasiy Ilich Tobonov | url = http://sciencestage.com/g/4258311/afanasiy-ilich-tobonov.html | access-date = 2011-01-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723051250/http://sciencestage.com/g/4258311/afanasiy-ilich-tobonov.html | archive-date = 2011-07-23 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2004 thousands of tiny birds fell from the sky over [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese president]] [[Hu Jintao]]'s birthplace [[Taizhou, Jiangsu]].  The event was seen as a worrying [[omen]] for [[Hu–Wen Administration|his rule]] to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=3&amp;art_id=109890&amp;sid=31938190&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20110407&amp;fc=7 |title=Rational help at hand when omens seem bad |publisher=The Standard |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019050727/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=3&amp;art_id=109890&amp;sid=31938190&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20110407&amp;fc=7 |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 15, 2009, in New York City.  A large flock of [[Canada geese]] was struck by [[US Airways Flight 1549]], disabling both of the [[Airbus A320]]'s engines and killing an unknown number of geese.
*2009 in [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey]]. A culling with the bird poison ([[avicide]]) [[DRC-1339]] received national attention after [[USDA]] employees dispensed the substance in [[Griggstown, New Jersey]] to kill an estimated 5,000 starlings that plagued [[feed lot]]s and [[dairies]] on local farms.  When "it began raining birds" community members became alarmed, unsure whether a toxin or disease was at work.  Two property owners in the area reported collecting over 150 birds each from their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D95VF0LO0.html|title=Bird culling fallout alarms New Jersey community|date=January 27, 2009|first=Victor|last=Epstein|publisher=AP Online|via=HighBeam|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/01/dead_birds_littering_franklin.html|title=Dead birds in Franklin Township were killed on purpose |quote=But no humans or pets were ever at risk, said the USDA, contending the pesticide, known as DRC-1339, is inert once it is eaten by the birds and becomes metabolized.|date=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* December 31, 2010, in [[Beebe, Arkansas]]. 3,000 [[red-winged blackbird]]s and [[European starling]]s died. Arkansas state wildlife authorities first received reports on December 31, 2010, shortly before midnight. Further investigation revealed the birds fell over a one-mile area of Beebe, with no other dead birds found outside that concentrated zone. The birds showed signs of physical trauma, leading one ornithologist with the [[Arkansas Game and Fish Commission]] to speculate the blackbirds might have been killed by lightning, high-altitude hail or possibly fireworks. The birds were sent to laboratories in Georgia and Wisconsin for necropsies to determine the cause of death. On January 5, 2011 the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission confirmed that the incident was caused by a resident setting off professional-grade [[fireworks]], startling the birds into a panic flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Fireworks likely cause of massive Ark. bird kill |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-01-05-arkansas-dead-birds-fireworks_N.htm |quote=It was someone shooting off professional grade fireworks in a residential district, scaring the night-blind birds out of their roost into a 25-mph flight that ran them into houses, signs and even the ground, says Karen Rowe, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission ornithologist. |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-07 |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One year later a virtual reprise took place with 5,000 birds plunging to the ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">In the United States, some blind or otherwise visually-impaired people '''fold dollar bills''' in specific ways so that they can identify the denominations of the bills by feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Würdemann |first=Henry Vanderbilt |author2=Black, Nelson Miles |title=Ophthalmology: Essays, Abstracts and Reviews |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] press |year=1913 |location=Milwaukee |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BB2gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22fold+bills%22+blind&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L7OfUb9qj7j2BLiFgRA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fold%20bills%22%20blind&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some people have their own idiosyncratic systems, there is a method recommended by the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*''Leave $1 bills unfolded.''
*''Fold $5 bills lengthwise.''
*''Fold $10 bills by width.''
*''Fold $20 bills lengthwise and then by width. Or you can fold them just lengthwise and put them in a separate section of your wallet.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeping Track of Money | work = |publisher=[[American Foundation for the Blind]] |url=http://www.afb.org/section.aspx?DocumentID=2232 |accessdate=2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike the banknotes of most countries, all denominations of United States paper money are the same size, preventing the visually impaired from identifying bills by feel. This alleged lack of access for the blind led to a 2002 court case, ''[[American Council of the Blind v. Paulson]]''. In 2006, U.S. District Judge [[James Robertson (judge)|James Robertson]] ruled that the American bills gave an undue burden to the blind and denied them "meaningful access" to the U.S. currency system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

&lt;!-- Causes and Diagnosis' --&gt;
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, [[obesity]], lack of physical exercise, drinking [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]], [[hormone replacement therapy]] during [[menopause]], [[ionizing radiation]], early age at [[menarche|first menstruation]], having children late or not at all, older age, prior history of breast cancer, and family history.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCR2014&gt;{{cite book |title = World Cancer Report 2014 |date = 2014 |publisher = World Health Organization |isbn = 978-92-832-0429-9 |pages = Chapter 5.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5–10% of cases are due to genes [[Heredity|inherited]] from a person's parents,&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt; including [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] among others.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt; Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] and the [[lobules]] that supply the ducts with milk.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt; Cancers developing from the ducts are known as [[Mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinomas]], while those developing from lobules are known as [[lobular carcinoma]]s.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt; In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=WCR2014 /&gt; Some cancers, such as [[ductal carcinoma in situ]], develop from [[pre-invasive lesions]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014 /&gt; The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a [[breast biopsy|biopsy]] of the concerning lump.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt; Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective.&lt;ref name=NCI2014Pt /&gt;

[[File:Breast Cancer.png|thumb|Breast cancer]]

[[File:Breast cancer.jpg|thumb|Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump, and skin dimpling.]]

The first noticeable [[symptom]] of breast cancer is typically a [[breast lump|lump]] that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of breast cancer cases are discovered when the woman feels a lump.&lt;ref name="merck"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] |date = February 2003 |title = Breast Disorders: Breast Cancer |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |accessdate = 5 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002141649/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archivedate = 2 October 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest breast cancers are detected by a [[mammogram]].&lt;ref name="acs cancer facts 2007" /&gt; Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; can also indicate breast cancer.

Indications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit, and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Watson M |title = Assessment of suspected cancer |journal = InnoAiT |volume = 1 |issue = 2 |pages = 94–107 |year = 2008 |pmid =  |doi = 10.1093/innovait/inn001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain ("[[mastodynia]]") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other [[breast health]] issues.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acs cancer facts 2007"&gt;{{cite web |author = American Cancer Society |year = 2007 |title = Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2007 |url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf |accessdate = 26 April 2007 |format = PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410025934/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf |archivedate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eMed"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = [[eMedicine]] |date = 23 August 2006 |title = Breast Cancer Evaluation |url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3287.HTM |accessdate = 5 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212070431/http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3287.HTM |archivedate = 12 February 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inflammatory breast cancer]] is a particular type of breast cancer which can pose a substantial diagnostic challenge. Symptoms may resemble a breast inflammation and may include itching, pain, swelling, nipple inversion, warmth and redness throughout the breast, as well as an orange-peel texture to the skin referred to as ''peau d'orange''.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.

Another reported symptom complex of breast cancer is [[Paget's disease of the breast]]. This [[syndrome]] presents as skin changes resembling [[eczema]], such as redness, discoloration, or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.&lt;ref name="nci paget"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[National Cancer Institute]] |date = 27 June 2005 |title = Paget's Disease of the Nipple: Questions and Answers |url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/pagets-breast |accessdate = 6 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410035920/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/pagets-breast |archivedate = 10 April 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, what initially appears as a [[fibroadenoma]] (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a [[phyllodes tumor]]. Phyllodes tumors are formed within the stroma  (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumors are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline, or malignant.&lt;ref name="phyllodes-tumor"&gt;{{cite web |author = answers.com |title = Oncology Encyclopedia: Cystosarcoma Phyllodes |url = http://www.answers.com/topic/phyllodes-tumor |accessdate = 10 August 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100908032727/http://www.answers.com/topic/phyllodes-tumor |archivedate = 8 September 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, breast cancer presents as [[metastatic]] disease—that is, cancer that has spread beyond the original organ. The symptoms caused by [[metastatic breast cancer]] will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung and brain.&lt;ref name="pmid17158753"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lacroix M |title = Significance, detection and markers of disseminated breast cancer cells |journal = [[Endocrine-Related Cancer]] |volume = 13 |issue = 4 |pages = 1033–67 |date = December 2006 |pmid = 17158753 |doi = 10.1677/ERC-06-0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unexplained weight loss can occasionally signal breast cancer, as can symptoms of fevers or chills. Bone or joint pains can sometimes be manifestations of metastatic breast cancer, as can jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called [[non-specific symptom|''non-specific'']], meaning they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.&lt;ref name="nci metastatic"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[National Cancer Institute]] |date = 1 September 2004 |title = Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers |url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic |accessdate = 6 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827093333/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic |archivedate = 27 August 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Fewer than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting Signs and Symptoms|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PcARTQwHLpIC|page=99}}|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-58255-668-0|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[benign breast disease]]s such as [[mastitis]] and [[fibroadenoma]] of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.&lt;ref name="merck breasts"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] |date = February 2003 |title = Breast Disorders: Overview of Breast Disorders |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/overview_of_breast_disorders.html |accessdate = 5 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003004918/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/overview_of_breast_disorders.html |archivedate = 3 October 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
{{Main|Risk factors of breast cancer}}

Risk factors can be divided into two categories:
* ''modifiable'' risk factors (things that people can change themselves, such as consumption of alcoholic beverages), and
* ''fixed'' risk factors (things that cannot be changed, such as age and biological sex).&lt;ref name="Hay2013" /&gt;
The primary risk factors for breast cancer are being female and older age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors = Reeder JG, Vogel VG |title = Breast cancer prevention |volume = 141 |pages = 149–64 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18274088 |doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-73161-2_10 |series = Cancer Treatment and Research |isbn = 978-0-387-73160-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other potential risk factors include genetics,&lt;ref name="Am I at risk"&gt;{{cite web |title = Am I at risk? |url = http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-information/breast-awareness/am-i-risk/risk |publisher = Breast Cancer Care |accessdate = 22 October 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025074635/http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-information/breast-awareness/am-i-risk/risk |archivedate = 25 October 2013 |df = dmy-all |date = 2018-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of childbearing or lack of breastfeeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer |title = Breast cancer and breastfeeding: collaborative reanalysis of individual data from 47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries, including 50302 women with breast cancer and 96973 women without the disease. |journal = Lancet |volume = 360 |issue = 9328 |pages = 187–95 |date = August 2002 |pmid = 12133652 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09454-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; higher levels of certain hormones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Yager JD, Davidson NE |title = Estrogen carcinogenesis in breast cancer |journal = N Engl J Med |volume = 354 |issue = 3 |pages = 270–82 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16421368 |doi = 10.1056/NEJMra050776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.center4research.org/hormone-therapy-menopause/ |title = Hormone Therapy and Menopause |publisher = National Research Center for Women &amp; Families |vauthors = Mazzucco A, Santoro E, DeSoto, M, Hong Lee J |date = February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; certain dietary patterns, and obesity.

=== Lifestyle ===
{{See also|List of breast carcinogenic substances}}

Obesity and drinking alcoholic beverages are among the most common modifiable risk factors.

[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking tobacco]] appears to increase the risk of breast cancer, with the greater the amount smoked and the earlier in life that smoking began, the higher the risk.&lt;ref name="Smoking2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Johnson KC, Miller AB, Collishaw NE, Palmer JR, Hammond SK, Salmon AG, Cantor KP, Miller MD, Boyd NF, Millar J, Turcotte F |title = Active smoking and secondhand smoke increase breast cancer risk: the report of the Canadian Expert Panel on Tobacco Smoke and Breast Cancer Risk (2009). |journal = Tobacco Control |volume = 20 |issue = 1 |pages = e2 |date = Jan 2011 |pmid = 21148114 |doi = 10.1136/tc.2010.035931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In those who are long-term smokers, the risk is increased 35% to 50%.&lt;ref name="Smoking2011" /&gt; A lack of physical activity has been linked to about 10% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Lee IM, Shiroma EJ, Lobelo F, Puska P, Blair SN, Katzmarzyk PT |title = Effect of physical inactivity on major non-communicable diseases worldwide: an analysis of burden of disease and life expectancy |journal = The Lancet |volume = 380 |issue = 9838 |pages = 219–29 |date = 1 July 2012 |pmid = 22818936 |pmc = 3645500 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61031-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sitting]] regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from breast cancer.

[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]. Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.]]

Breast cancer, like other [[cancers]], occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.

Normal cells will commit cell suicide ([[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]) when they are no longer needed. Until then, they are protected from cell suicide by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] pathway; another is the [[Ras (protein)|RAS]]/[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]]/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently "on", rendering the cell incapable of committing suicide when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the "on" position, and the cancer cell does not commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |author1 = Adrian Lee |author2 = Carlos Arteaga |title = 32nd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium |booktitle = Sunday Morning Year-End Review |date = 14 December 2009 |url = http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813021816/http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |archivedate = 13 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of people with breast cancer and people with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases.  The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called [[hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome]].  The best known of these, the [[BRCA mutation|''BRCA'' mutations]], confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent.  Some mutations associated with cancer, such as ''[[p53]]'', ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.&lt;ref name="acs bc facts 2005-6"&gt;{{cite web |author = American Cancer Society |year = 2005 |title = Breast Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2005–2006 |url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |accessdate = 26 April 2007 |format = PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613192148/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |archivedate = 13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Dunning AM, Healey CS, Pharoah PD, Teare MD, Ponder BA, Easton DF |title = A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk |journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention |volume = 8 |issue = 10 |pages = 843–54 |date = October 1999 |pmid = 10548311 |doi =  |url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10548311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary ''BRCA'' gene mutations between carrier families.

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:En Breast cancer illustrations.png|thumb|Early signs of possible breast cancer]]

Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample—or [[breast biopsy|biopsy]]—of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.

The two most commonly used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple [[cyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Saslow D, Hannan J, Osuch J, Alciati MH, Baines C, Barton M, Bobo JK, Coleman C, Dolan M, Gaumer G, Kopans D, Kutner S, Lane DS, Lawson H, Meissner H, Moorman C, Pennypacker H, Pierce P, Sciandra E, Smith R, Coates R |title = Clinical breast examination: practical recommendations for optimizing performance and reporting |journal = CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians |volume = 54 |issue = 6 |pages = 327–344 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15537576 |doi = 10.3322/canjclin.54.6.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove a sample of the fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as [[fine needle aspiration]], or fine needle aspiration and cytology—FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. The needle aspiration may be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic using local anaesthetic if required.{{clarify|reason=does 'if required' refer to the anaesthesia?|date=July 2013}} A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.

Other options for biopsy include a [[core biopsy]] or [[vacuum-assisted breast biopsy]],&lt;ref name="pmid20130983"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Yu YH, Liang C, Yuan XZ |title = Diagnostic value of vacuum-assisted breast biopsy for breast carcinoma: a meta-analysis and systematic review. |journal = Breast Cancer Research and Treatment |volume = 120 |issue = 2 |pages = 469–79 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20130983 |doi = 10.1007/s10549-010-0750-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are procedures in which a section of the breast lump is removed; or an [[excisional biopsy]], in which the entire lump is removed. Very often the results of physical examination by a healthcare provider, mammography, and additional tests that may be performed in special circumstances (such as imaging by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) are sufficient to warrant excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and primary treatment method.

Breast cancers are classified by several grading systems. Each of these influences the [[prognosis]] and can affect treatment response. Description of a breast cancer optimally includes all of these factors.
* '''Histopathology'''. Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histological]] appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal]] or lobular carcinoma. ''Carcinoma in situ'' is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |date=10 November 2011 }}, Ch. 253, Breast Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.
* '''Stage'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|Breast cancer staging]] using the [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|TNM system]] is based on the size of the &lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;umor ('''T'''), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph node|lymph]] &lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;odes ('''N''') in the armpits, and whether the tumor has &lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;etastasized ('''M''') (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. &lt;br /&gt;The main stages are:
** Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS).
** Stages 1–3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.
** Stage 4 is [[Metastatic breast cancer|'metastatic' cancer]] that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

:Where available, [[imaging studies]] may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer. However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the person to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name="ASCOfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page =  |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = 14 August 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |archivedate = 31 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarlsonBreast"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Carlson RW, Allred DC, Anderson BO, Burstein HJ, Carter WB, Edge SB, Erban JK, Farrar WB, Goldstein LJ, Gradishar WJ, Hayes DF, Hudis CA, Jahanzeb M, Kiel K, Ljung BM, Marcom PK, Mayer IA, McCormick B, Nabell LM, Pierce LJ, Reed EC, Smith ML, Somlo G, Theriault RL, Topham NS, Ward JH, Winer EP, Wolff AC |title = Breast cancer.

* '''Receptor status'''. Breast cancer cells have [[Breast cancer classification#Receptor status|receptors]] on their surface and in their [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Chemical messengers such as [[hormone]]s bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have three important receptors: [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and [[HER2/neu|HER2]]. &lt;br /&gt;ER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. [[tamoxifen]]), and generally have a better prognosis. Untreated, HER2+ breast cancers are generally more aggressive than HER2- breast cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kumar |first = Vinay |title = Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |year = 2010 |publisher = Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier inc. |location = Philadelphia |isbn = 978-1-4160-3121-5 |page = 1090 |author2 = Abul Abbas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sotirou"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sotiriou C, Pusztai L |title = Gene-expression signatures in breast cancer |journal = N.

* '''DNA assays'''.  [[Breast cancer classification#DNA classification|DNA testing]] of various types including [[DNA microarray]]s have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells.  The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.

== Screening ==

[[File:BreastScreen Aotearoa.JPG|thumb|A mobile breast cancer screening unit in New Zealand]]

Breast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed including clinical and self [[breast exams]], [[mammography]], genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

A clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities. Clinical breast exams are performed by health care providers, while self-breast exams are performed by the person themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Screening |url = https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm |work = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate = 17 November 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151118012201/http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm |archivedate = 18 November 2015 |df = dmy-all |date = 2018-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence does not support the effectiveness of either type of breast exam, as by the time a lump is large enough to be found it is likely to have been growing for several years and thus soon be large enough to be found without an exam.&lt;ref name=USPSTFScreen2009&gt;{{cite web |title = Screening for Breast Cancer |url = http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm |work = US Preventative Services Task Force |accessdate = 24 December 2012 |date = December 2009 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130102015424/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm |archivedate = 2 January 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Kösters JP, Gøtzsche PC |title = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue = 2 |pages = CD003373 |year = 2003 |pmid = 12804462 |doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses [[X-ray]]s to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps.

== Management ==
{{Main|Breast cancer management}}

The management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the prognosis is worse or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.

Breast cancer is usually treated with [[surgery]], which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Saini KS, Taylor C, Ramirez AJ, Palmieri C, Gunnarsson U, Schmoll HJ, Dolci SM, Ghenne C, Metzger-Filho O, Skrzypski M, Paesmans M, Ameye L, Piccart-Gebhart MJ, de Azambuja E |title = Role of the multidisciplinary team in breast cancer management: results from a large international survey involving 39 countries |journal = Annals of Oncology |volume = 23 |issue = 4 |pages = 853–9 |date = August 2011 |pmid = 21821551 |doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdr352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years. Monoclonal antibodies, or other immune-modulating treatments, may be administered in certain cases of metastatic and other advanced stages of breast cancer.

=== Surgery ===

[[File:Mastectomie 02.jpg|thumb|Chest after right breast [[mastectomy]]]]

Surgery involves the physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy.

Standard surgeries include:
* [[Mastectomy]]: Removal of the whole breast.
* [[Quadrantectomy]]: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.
* [[Lumpectomy]]: Removal of a small part of the breast.
Once the tumor has been removed, if the person desires, [[breast reconstruction surgery]], a type of [[plastic surgery]], may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.
Alternatively, women use [[breast prostheses]] to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. [[Nipple prosthesis]] can be used at any time following the mastectomy.

=== Medication ===

Drugs used after and in addition to surgery are called [[Adjuvant cancer therapy|adjuvant therapy]]. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called [[neoadjuvant therapy]]. [[Aspirin]] may reduce mortality from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Holmes MD, Chen WY, Li L, Hertzmark E, Spiegelman D, Hankinson SE |title = Aspirin Intake and Survival After Breast Cancer |journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume = 28 |issue = 9 |pages = 1467–72 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20159825 |pmc = 2849768 |doi = 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.7918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment:  hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.

'''[[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormone blocking therapy]]'''
:Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. [[tamoxifen]], or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an [[aromatase inhibitor]], e.g. [[anastrozole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Ting Bao |author2 = Michelle A Rudek |title = The Clinical Pharmacology of Anastrozole |journal = European Oncology &amp; Haematology |volume = 7 |issue = 2 |pages = 106–8 |year = 2011 |pmid =  |doi =  |url = http://www.touchoncology.com/articles/clinical-pharmacology-anastrozole |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120419163101/http://www.touchoncology.com/articles/clinical-pharmacology-anastrozole |archivedate = 19 April 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[letrozole]]. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Burstein |first1 = HJ |last2 = Temin |first2 = S |last3 = Anderson |first3 = H |last4 = Buchholz |first4 = TA |last5 = Davidson |first5 = NE |last6 = Gelmon |first6 = KE |last7 = Giordano |first7 = SH |last8 = Hudis |first8 = CA |last9 = Rowden |first9 = D|last10=Solky|first10=AJ |last11 = Stearns |first11 = V |last12 = Winer |first12 = EP |last13 = Griggs |first13 = JJ |title = Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update. |journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology |date = 27 May 2014 |pmid = 24868023 |doi = 10.1200/JCO.2013.54.2258 |volume = 32 |issue = 21 |pages = 2255–69 |pmc = 4876310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Letrozole is recommended for 5 years.  Aromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group |title = Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen in early breast cancer: patient-level meta-analysis of the randomised trials |journal = The Lancet |date = 23 July 2015 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61074-1 |volume = 386 |issue = 10001 |pages = 1341–1352 |pmid = 26211827 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Petit T, Dufour P, Tannock I |title = A critical evaluation of the role of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer |journal = Endocr.

'''[[Chemotherapy]]'''
:Chemotherapy is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as "AC",  combines [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[doxorubicin]]. Sometimes a [[taxane]] drug, such as [[docetaxel]], is added, and the regime is then known as "CAT". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, [[methotrexate]], and [[fluorouracil]] (or "CMF"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.
'''[[Monoclonal antibodies]]'''
:[[Trastuzumab]], a monoclonal antibody to HER2 (a cell receptor that is especially active in some breast cancer cells), has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Jahanzeb M |title = Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer |journal = Clin. Breast Cancer |volume = 8 |issue = 4 |pages = 324–33 |date = August 2008 |pmid = 18757259 |doi = 10.3816/CBC.2008.n.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When stimulated by certain growth factors, HER2 causes cellular growth and division; in the absence of stimulation by the growth factor, the cell will normally stop growing. Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers [[overexpress]] the HER2 gene or its protein product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Entrez Gene: ERBB2 v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian) |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=2064 |accessdate = 17 November 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091026055528/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=2064 |archivedate = 26 October 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. When trastuzumab binds to the HER2 in breast cancer cells that overexpress the receptor, trastuzumab prevents growth factors from being able to bind to and stimulate the receptors, effectively blocking the growth of the cancer cells. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of people who receive it suffer significant heart damage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.herceptin.com/hcp/adjuvant-treatment/studies-efficacy/joint-analysis.jsp |title = Herceptin (trastuzumab) Adjuvant HER2+ Breast Cancer Therapy Pivotal Studies and Efficacy Data |publisher = Herceptin.com |accessdate = 8 May 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100406014305/http://www.herceptin.com/hcp/adjuvant-treatment/studies-efficacy/joint-analysis.jsp |archivedate = 6 April 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiation ===

[[File:Diagram showing how you have internal radiotherapy for breast cancer CRUK 159.svg|thumb|right|Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer]]

[[Radiotherapy]] is given after surgery to the region of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery. It may also have a beneficial effect on tumor microenvironment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Massarut S, Baldassare G, Belleti B, Reccanello S, D'Andrea S, Ezio C, Perin T, Roncadin M, Vaidya JS |title = Intraoperative radiotherapy impairs breast cancer cell motility induced by surgical wound fluid |journal = J Clin Oncol |volume = 24 |issue = 18S |page = 10611 |year = 2006 |pmid =  |doi =  |url = http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=40&amp;abstractID=34291 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122626/http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=40&amp;abstractID=34291 |archivedate = 12 January 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Belletti B, Vaidya JS, D'Andrea S, Entschladen F, Roncadin M, Lovat F, Berton S, Perin T, Candiani E, Reccanello S, Veronesi A, Canzonieri V, Trovò MG, Zaenker KS, Colombatti A, Baldassarre G, Massarut S |title = Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy impairs the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding |journal = Clin.

Conventionally radiotherapy is given ''after'' the operation for breast cancer.  Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 reduction of risk) when delivered in the correct dose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation |title = Radiation Therapy |date =  |work = Breastcancer.org |accessdate = 17 November 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117193610/http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation |archivedate = 17 November 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision).

== Prognosis ==

[[File:RecurrentbreastCA1.gif|thumb|An example of an advanced recurrent breast cancer with an ulcerating axillary mass]]

=== Prognostic factors ===

The [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the breast cancer is the most important component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title = Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher = Merck.com |accessdate = 8 May 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archivedate = 10 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an excellent prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |title = Surgery Choices for Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer |publisher = National Cancer Institute and the National Research Center for Women &amp; Families |date = August 2004 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813054115/http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |archivedate = 13 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a progressively poorer prognosis and greater risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without [[Lymphadenectomy|lymph node removal]]), chemotherapy (plus [[trastuzumab]] for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).{{mcn|date=May 2018}}
* Stage 4, metastatic cancer, (i.e. spread to distant sites) has poor prognosis and is managed by various combination of all treatments from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Ten-year survival rate is 5% without treatment and 10% with optimal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title = Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher = Merck.com |accessdate = 14 November 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archivedate = 10 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breast cancer classification#Grade|The breast cancer grade]] is assessed by comparison of the breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Elston CW, Ellis IO |title = Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I. The value of histological grade in breast cancer: experience from a large study with long-term follow-up |journal = Histopathology |volume = 19 |issue = 5 |pages = 403–10 |date = November 1991 |pmid = 1757079 |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1991.tb00229.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger women with an age of less than 40 years or women over 80 years tend to have a poorer prognosis than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Peppercorn J |title = Breast Cancer in Women Under 40 |journal = Oncology |volume = 23 |issue = 6 |pages =  |year = 2009 |pmid =  |doi =  |url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1413886 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090616191104/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1413886 |archivedate = 16 June 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological aspects ===
Not all people with breast cancer experience their illness in the same manner. Factors such as age can have a significant impact on the way a person copes with a breast cancer diagnosis. Premenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer must confront the issues of early [[menopause]] induced by many of the chemotherapy regimens used to treat their breast cancer, especially those that use hormones to counteract ovarian function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Pritchard KI |title = Ovarian Suppression/Ablation in Premenopausal ER-Positive Breast Cancer Patients |journal = Oncology |volume = 23 |issue = 1 |pages =  |year = 2009 |pmid =  |doi =  |url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/1366719?pageNumber=1 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090705230857/http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/1366719?pageNumber=1 |archivedate = 5 July 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Louis-Jacques Goussier Enzyklopädie Diderot Pl XXIX.jpg|thumb|Breast cancer surgery in 18th century]]

Because of its visibility, breast cancer was the form of cancer most often described in ancient documents.&lt;ref name=Olson9&gt;{{cite book |last = Olson |first = James Stuart |title = Bathsheba's breast: women, cancer &amp; history |publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |location = Baltimore |year = 2002 |pages = 9–13 |isbn = 978-0-8018-6936-5 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because autopsies were rare, cancers of the internal organs were essentially invisible to ancient medicine.  Breast cancer, however, could be felt through the skin, and in its advanced state often developed into [[fungating lesion]]s:  the tumor would become [[necrotic]] (die from the inside, causing the tumor to appear to break up) and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]] through the skin, weeping fetid, dark fluid.&lt;ref name=Olson9 /&gt;

The oldest discovered evidence of breast cancer is from Egypt and dates back 4200 years, to the [[Sixth Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/24/egypt-antiquities-cancer-idINKBN0MK1ZW20150324 |title = Oldest evidence of breast cancer found in Egyptian skeleton |publisher = Reuters |date = 24 March 2015 |accessdate = 25 March 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023314/http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/24/egypt-antiquities-cancer-idINKBN0MK1ZW20150324 |archivedate = 27 March 2015 |df = dmy-all |newspaper = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of a woman's remains from the necropolis of [[Qubbet el-Hawa]] showed the typical destructive damage due to [[metastatic]] spread.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt; The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] describes 8 cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were treated by [[cauterization]]. The writing says about the disease, "There is no treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The History of Cancer |work = American Cancer Society |date = 25 March 2002 |url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_the_history_of_cancer_72.asp?sitearea=CRI |accessdate = 9 October 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009011530/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_the_history_of_cancer_72.asp?sitearea=CRI |archivedate = 9 October 2006 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For centuries, physicians described similar cases in their practices, with the same conclusion.  Ancient medicine, from the time of the Greeks through the 17th century, was based on [[humoralism]], and thus believed that breast cancer was generally caused by imbalances in the fundamental fluids that controlled the body, especially an excess of [[black bile]].&lt;ref name=Olson32&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively it was seen as [[divine punishment]].&lt;ref name=Yalom&gt;{{cite book |author = Yalom, Marilyn |title = A history of the breast |publisher = Alfred A. Knopf |location = New York |year = 1997 |page = 234 |isbn = 978-0-679-43459-7 |oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 18th century, a wide variety of medical explanations were proposed, including a lack of sexual activity, too much sexual activity, physical injuries to the breast, curdled breast milk, and various forms of lymphatic blockages, either internal or due to restrictive clothing.&lt;ref name=Olson32 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aronowitz /&gt;  In the 19th century, the Scottish surgeon John Rodman said that fear of cancer caused cancer, and that this anxiety, learned by example from the mother, accounted for breast cancer's tendency to run in families.&lt;ref name=Aronowitz /&gt;

Although breast cancer was known in ancient times, it was uncommon until the 19th century, when improvements in sanitation and control of deadly [[infectious disease]]s resulted in dramatic increases in lifespan.  Previously, most women had died too young to have developed breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Aronowitz&gt;{{cite book |author = Aronowitz, Robert A. |title = Unnatural history: breast cancer and American society |edition =  |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge, UK |year = 2007 |origyear =  |pages = 22–24 |isbn = 978-0-521-82249-7 |oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, early and frequent childbearing and breastfeeding probably reduced the rate of breast cancer development in those women who did survive to middle age.&lt;ref name=Aronowitz /&gt;

Because ancient medicine believed that the cause was systemic, rather than local, and because surgery carried a high mortality rate, the preferred treatments tended to be pharmacological rather than surgical.  Herbal and mineral preparations, especially involving the poison [[arsenic]], were relatively common.

Mastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as AD 548, when it was proposed by the court physician [[Aetios of Amida]] to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]].&lt;ref name=Olson9 /&gt;  It was not until doctors achieved greater understanding of the circulatory system in the 17th century that they could link breast cancer's spread to the [[lymph nodes]] in the armpit. The French surgeon [[Jean Louis Petit]] (1674–1750) performed total mastectomies which included removing the [[axillary lymph nodes]], as he recognized that this reduced recurrence.&lt;ref name="Faguet 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faguet|first1=Guy|title=The Conquest of Cancer: A Distant Goal|date=2015|isbn=9789401791656|page=24|chapter=Chapter 2: An Historical Overview: From Prehistory to WWII. From Medieval Europe to World War II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petit's work was built on by another French surgeon, [[Bernard Peyrilhe]] (1737–1804), who additionally removed the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral muscle]] underlying the breast, as he judged that this greatly improved the prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaartinen|first1=Marjo|title=Breast cancer in the eighteenth century|date=2013|publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto|location=London|isbn=978-1-84893-364-4|page=53|chapter=Chapter 2: "But Sad Resources": Treating Cancer in the Eighteenth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish surgeon [[Benjamin Bell]] (1749–1806) advocated removal of the entire breast, even when only a portion was affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macintyre|first1=IM|title=Scientific surgeon of the Enlightenment or 'plagiarist in everything': a reappraisal of Benjamin Bell (1749-1806).|journal=The Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|date=June 2011|volume=41|issue=2|pages=174–81|doi=10.4997/JRCPE.2011.211|pmid=21677925}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their successful work was carried on by [[William Stewart Halsted]] who started performing [[radical mastectomies]] in 1882, helped greatly by advances in general surgical technology, such as [[aseptic technique]] and [[anesthesia]]. The Halsted radical mastectomy often involved removing both breasts, associated lymph nodes, and the underlying chest muscles. This often led to long-term pain and disability, but was seen as necessary in order to prevent the cancer from recurring.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt; Before the advent of the Halsted radical mastectomy, 20-year survival rates were only 10%; Halsted's surgery raised that rate to 50%.&lt;ref name=Olson1&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extending Halsted's work, [[Jerome Urban]] promoted superradical mastectomies, taking even more tissue, until 1963, when the ten-year survival rates proved equal to the less-damaging radical mastectomy.&lt;ref name=Olson102&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=102–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical mastectomies remained the standard of care in America until the 1970s, but in Europe, breast-sparing procedures, often followed by radiation therapy, were generally adopted in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt;  One reason for this striking difference in approach may be the structure of the medical professions:  European surgeons, descended from the [[barber surgeon]], were held in less esteem than [[physicians]]; in America, the surgeon was the king of the medical profession.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt;  Additionally, there were far more European women surgeons:  Less than one percent of American surgical oncologists were female, but some European breast cancer wards boasted a medical staff that was half female.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt;  American health insurance companies also paid surgeons more to perform radical mastectomies than they did to perform more intricate breast-sparing surgeries.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt;

Breast cancer staging systems were developed in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=Olson102 /&gt;

During the 1970s, a new understanding of [[metastasis]] led to perceiving cancer as a systemic illness as well as a localized one, and more sparing procedures were developed that proved equally effective.  Modern [[chemotherapy]] developed after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Lax&gt;{{cite book |author = Marc Lacroix |title = A Concise History of Breast Cancer |publisher = Nova Science Publishers |location = USA |year = 2011 |pages = 59–68 |quote =  |isbn = 978-1-61122-305-7 |oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent women who died of breast cancer include [[Anne of Austria]], the mother of Louis XIV of France; [[Mary Ball Washington|Mary Washington]], mother of George, and [[Rachel Carson]], the environmentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=26,28,229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[case-control]]led study on breast cancer epidemiology was done by [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 controls of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="isbn3-7643-6818-7"&gt;{{Cite book |author = Alfredo Morabia |title = A History of Epidemiologic Methods and Concepts |publisher = Birkhauser |location = Boston |year = 2004 |pages = 301–302 |isbn = 978-3-7643-6818-0 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=E-OZbEmPSTkC&amp;pg=PA301 |accessdate = 31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of women who had successfully completed standard treatment then demanded and received high-dose [[bone marrow transplant]]s, thinking this would lead to better long-term survival.  However, it proved completely ineffective, and 15–20% of women died because of the brutal treatment.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book |first = Gayle A. |last = Sulik |title = Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = USA |year = 2010 |pages = 200–3 |ref = harv |isbn = 978-0-19-974045-1 |oclc = 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 reports from the [[Nurses' Health Study]] and the 2002 conclusions of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] trial conclusively proved that [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] significantly increased the incidence of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

== Society and culture ==
{{See also|Breast cancer awareness|List of people with breast cancer}}

Before the 20th century, breast cancer was feared and discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful.  As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care.  When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began [[raising awareness]] of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment.  The "Women's Field Army", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the [[American Cancer Society]]) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer [[support group]], called "Reach to Recovery", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[breast cancer movement]] of the 1980s and 1990s developed out of the larger [[feminist movement]]s and women's health movement of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This series of political and educational campaigns, partly inspired by the politically and socially effective [[AIDS]] awareness campaigns, resulted in the widespread acceptance of second opinions before surgery, less invasive surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.crcfl.net/content/view/history-of-breast-cancer-advocacy.html |title = History of Breast Cancer Advocacy |author = Bob Riter |publisher = Cancer Resource Center of the Finger Lakes |accessdate = 29 June 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130623074930/http://www.crcfl.net/content/view/history-of-breast-cancer-advocacy.html |archivedate = 23 June 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pink ribbon ===
{{Main|Pink ribbon}}

[[File:Pink ribbon.svg|uprighcast|150px|thumb|The [[pink ribbon]] is a symbol to show support for breast cancer awareness]]

A [[pink ribbon]] is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, which can be made inexpensively, are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like [[Poppy day#Poppies|poppies on Remembrance Day]].  They may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that the manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=27–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pink ribbon is associated with individual generosity, faith in scientific progress, and a "can-do" attitude.  It encourages consumers to focus on the emotionally appealing ultimate vision of a cure for breast cancer, rather than on the fraught path between current knowledge and any future cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=359–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearing or displaying a pink ribbon has been criticized by the opponents of this practice as a kind of [[slacktivism]], because it has no practical positive effect.  It has also been criticized as [[hypocrisy]], because some people wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like [[patient rights]] and anti-pollution legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=366–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Landeman, Anne |date = 11 June 2008 |url = http://www.prwatch.org/node/7436 |title = Pinkwashing: Can Shopping Cure Breast Cancer? |publisher = [[Center for Media and Democracy]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605122507/http://www.prwatch.org/node/7436 |archivedate = 5 June 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=365–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and [[objectifying]] women and their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=372–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Breast Cancer Action]] launched the "Think Before You Pink" campaign, and said that businesses have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101008/pinkwashing-pink-ribbon-101009/20101009/?hub=OttawaHome Breast cancer month overshadowed by 'pinkwashing'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012151918/http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101008/pinkwashing-pink-ribbon-101009/20101009/?hub=OttawaHome |date=12 October 2010 }} 9 October 2010, Angela Mulholland, CTV.ca News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast cancer culture ===
Breast cancer culture, also known as pink ribbon culture, is the set of activities, attitudes, and values that surround and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism. 

In breast cancer culture, breast cancer therapy is viewed as a [[rite of passage]] rather than a disease.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich&gt;{{Cite news |first = Barbara |last = Ehrenreich |title = Welcome to Cancerland |newspaper = [[Harper's Magazine]] |date = November 2001 |url = http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101120135605/http://barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |archivedate = 20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To fit into this mold, the woman with breast cancer needs to normalize and feminize her appearance, and minimize the disruption that her health issues cause anyone else.  Anger, sadness, and negativity must be silenced.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

As with most cultural models, people who conform to the model are given social status, in this case as [[cancer survivor]]s.  Women who reject the model are shunned, punished and shamed.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

The culture is criticized for treating adult women like little girls, as evidenced by "baby" toys such as pink [[teddy bear]]s given to adult women.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

The primary purposes or goals of breast cancer culture are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the pre-eminent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is doing something effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emphasis ===

Compared to other diseases or other cancers, breast cancer receives a proportionately greater share of resources and attention. In 2001 MP [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Ian Gibson]], chairman of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] all party group on cancer stated "The treatment has been skewed by the [[lobbying]], there is no doubt about that. Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses."&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/oct/07/cancercare |location = London |work = [[The Guardian]] |first = Anthony |last = Browne |authorlink = Anthony Browne (UK politics) |title = Cancer bias puts breasts first |date = 7 October 2001 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161226194151/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/oct/07/cancercare |archivedate = 26 December 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breast cancer also receives significantly more media coverage than other, equally prevalent cancers, with a study by Prostate Coalition showing 2.6 breast cancer stories for each one covering [[prostate cancer|cancer of the prostate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = A Gender Gap in Cancer |date = 13 June 2007 |author = Arnst, Catherine |journal = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |issn = 0007-7135 |url = http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070612_953676.htm |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806185800/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070612_953676.htm |archivedate = 6 August 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately there is a concern that favoring sufferers of breast cancer with disproportionate funding and research on their behalf may well be costing lives elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;  Partly because of its relatively high prevalence and long-term survival rates, research is biased towards breast cancer.  Some subjects, such as [[cancer-related fatigue]], have been studied little except in women with breast cancer.

One result of breast cancer's high visibility is that statistical results can sometimes be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives—a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.&lt;ref name=Olson199&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This obscures the reality, which is that about ten times as many women will die from [[heart disease]] or [[stroke]] than from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Ave, Melanie |title = Tampabay: All May Not Be in the Pink |journal = [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date = 10 October 2006 |url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/06/Tampabay/All_may_not_be_in_the.shtml |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090824100103/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/06/Tampabay/All_may_not_be_in_the.shtml |archivedate = 24 August 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on breast cancer screening may be harming women by subjecting them to unnecessary radiation, biopsies, and surgery.  One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own.&lt;ref name=Ave&gt;{{cite news |title = The Trouble with Mammograms |date = 17 August 2009 |author = Aschwanden, Christie |newspaper = [[The Los Angeles Times]] |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/17/health/he-breast-overdiagnosis17 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204073704/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/17/health/he-breast-overdiagnosis17 |archivedate = 4 December 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screening mammography efficiently finds non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, even while overlooking serious cancers.  According to H. Gilbert Welch of the [[Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice]], research on screening mammography has taken the "brain-dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers" rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.&lt;ref name=Ave /&gt;

== Pregnancy ==

Breast cancers occur during pregnancy at the same rate as breast cancers in non-pregnant women of the same age. Breast cancer then becomes more common in the 5 or 10 years following pregnancy but then becomes less common than among the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Azim HA |first1 = Jr |last2 = Santoro |first2 = L |last3 = Russell-Edu |first3 = W |last4 = Pentheroudakis |first4 = G |last5 = Pavlidis |first5 = N |last6 = Peccatori |first6 = FA |title = Prognosis of pregnancy-associated breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 30 studies. |journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews |date = November 2012 |volume = 38 |issue = 7 |pages = 834–42 |pmid = 22785217 |doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cancers are known as postpartum breast cancer and have worse outcomes including an increased risk of distant spread of disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Schedin |first1 = P |title = Pregnancy-associated breast cancer and metastasis. |journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer |date = April 2006 |volume = 6 |issue = 4 |pages = 281–91 |pmid = 16557280 |doi = 10.1038/nrc1839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cancers found during or shortly after pregnancy appear at approximately the same rate as other cancers in women of a similar age.&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt;

Diagnosing new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt; As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as [[MRI]]s (magnetic resonance imaging), [[CT scan]]s, ultrasounds, and [[mammogram]]s with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as [[PET scan]]s are not.&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt;

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt; However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the [[first trimester]], increase the risk of [[birth defect]]s and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt;  Elective [[abortion]]s are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.&lt;ref name=yarbro /&gt;

Radiation treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of [[mastitis]]. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.&lt;ref name=yarbro&gt;{{cite book |title = Cancer nursing: principles and practice |editor1 = Connie Henke Yarbro |editor2 = Debra Wujcik |editor3 = Barbara Holmes Gobel |edition = 7 |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |year = 2011 |isbn = 978-1-4496-1829-2 |pages = 901–905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding future pregnancy among breast [[cancer survivor]]s, there is often fear of [[cancer recurrence]].&lt;ref name=Goncalves2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Gonçalves V, Sehovic I, Quinn G |title = Childbearing attitudes and decisions of young breast cancer survivors: A systematic review |journal = Human Reproduction Update |volume = 20 |issue = 2 |pages = 279–92 |year = 2013 |pmid = 24077938 |doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt039 |pmc = 3922144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many still regard pregnancy and parenthood to represent normalcy, happiness and life fulfillment.&lt;ref name=Goncalves2013 /&gt;

== Hormones ==

=== Birth control ===

In breast cancer survivors, non-hormonal [[birth control]] methods should be used as first-line options. [[Progestogen]]-based methods such as [[depot medroxyprogesterone acetate]], [[IUD with progestogen]] or [[progestogen only pill]]s have a poorly investigated but possible increased risk of cancer recurrence, but may be used if positive effects outweigh this possible risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = McNaught J, Reid RL, Provencher DM |title = Progesterone-only and non-hormonal contraception in the breast cancer survivor: Joint Review and Committee Opinion of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists of Canada |journal = J Obstet Gynaecol Can |volume = 28 |issue = 7 |pages = 616–39 |date = July 2006 |pmid = 16924781 |doi =  10.1016/S1701-2163(16)32195-8|url =  |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menopausal hormone replacement ===

In breast cancer survivors, it is recommended to first consider non-hormonal options for [[menopausal]] effects, such as [[bisphosphonate]]s or [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s (SERMs) for osteoporosis, and [[vaginal estrogen]] for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If hormone replacement is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with an [[intrauterine device with progestogen]] may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20160407214503/https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html Management of the menopause after breast cancer], from the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]].

=== Breast cancer cell lines ===
{{See also|List of breast cancer cell lines}}

A considerable part of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]] studies performed with [[cell lines]] derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating [[stroma (animal tissue)|stromal]] cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard [[growth medium|media]]. The first breast cancer cell line described, [[BT-20 (cell line)|BT-20]], was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from [[pleural effusion]]s. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by [[fibroblasts]] and other tumor stroma cells.
Many of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely [[MCF-7]], [[T-47D]], and [[MDA-MB-231]], account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a [[Medline]]-based survey.

=== Molecular markers ===

==== Transcription factors ====

[[NFAT]] transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation. Indeed, NFAT1 (NFATC2) and NFAT5 are pro-invasive and pro-migratory in breast carcinoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Jauliac S, López-Rodriguez C, Shaw LM, Brown LF, Rao A, Toker A |title = The role of NFAT transcription factors in integrin-mediated carcinoma invasion. |journal = Nature Cell Biology |volume = 4 |issue = 7 |pages = 540–4 |date = July 2002 |pmid = 12080349 |doi = 10.1038/ncb816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Yoeli-Lerner M, Yiu GK, Rabinovitz I, Erhardt P, Jauliac S, Toker A |title = Akt blocks breast cancer cell motility and invasion through the transcription factor NFAT. |journal = Molecular Cell |volume = 20 |issue = 4 |pages = 539–50 |date = 23 November 2005 |pmid = 16307918 |doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.10.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and NFAT3 (NFATc4) is an inhibitor of cell motility.&lt;ref name="Fougère 2292–301"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Fougère M, Gaudineau B, Barbier J, Guaddachi F, Feugeas JP, Auboeuf D, Jauliac S |title = NFAT3 transcription factor inhibits breast cancer cell motility by targeting the Lipocalin 2 gene. |journal = Oncogene |volume = 29 |issue = 15 |pages = 2292–301 |date = 15 April 2010 |pmid = 20101218 |doi = 10.1038/onc.2009.499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21178">'''Capital punishment''' was used from the creation of the modern [[Serbian state]] in 1804. On 26 February 2002, [[Serbian Parliament]] adopted amendments striking the [[death penalty]] from the Criminal Code. The last execution, by [[execution by shooting|shooting]], took place on 14 February 1992, and the last death sentences were pronounced in 2001. Serbia is bound by the following international conventions prohibiting capital punishment (dates of ratification are given in parentheses): [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (6 September 2001), Protocols No. 6 and No. 13 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (3 March 2004). According to Article 24 of the [[Serbian constitution]] (2006): „Human life is inviolable. There shall be no death penalty in the Republic of Serbia“.

==History==

===Serbia, 1804–1914===

In the first decades of the 19th century, the death penalty was widely used in Serbia for a variety of offenses: murder, theft, political crimes, infanticide and even for extramarital sexual relations.

Until 1858, different modes of execution were in use: shooting, hanging, breaking on the wheel, „lethal gauntlet“ (a double file of men facing each other and armed with birch rods with which to strike at a person who is made to run between them) and decapitation; in the very beginning, there were a few instances of impalement. Until 1842, murderers were subject to „mirror“ punishments, meaning that a murderer was to be killed in an identical manner in which he killed the victim (often with the same weapon). In addition, the bodies of executed offenders were almost always publicly displayed on wheels and kept there for a set period of time or until „complete decay“. In 1858, shooting became the only legal mode of execution, while the practice of displaying the bodies was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Živanović|first=Toma|title=Zakonski izvori krivičnog prava Srbije od 1804. do 1865 [Statutory sources of Serbia’s criminal law from 1804 to 1865]|year=1967|location=Belgrade|pages=431–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the first Serbian Penal Code, passed in 1860, the death sentences were to be executed in public, by shooting, while the executed body was to be buried immediately at the place of execution. The Code included sixteen capital offenses: various forms of murder and robbery leading to death, as well as treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaznitelni zakonik za Knjažestvo Srbiju, 1860 [Penal Code for the Princedom of Serbia, 1860]|url=http://www.smrtnakazna.rs/Portals/0/SrbijaPropisi/Kaznitelni%20zakonik%201860.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1863, however, the death penalty was re-introduced for theft and certain other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Izmene Kaznitelnog zakonika, 1863 [Amendments to the Penal Code, 1863], Art. 223|url=http://www.smrtnakazna.rs/Portals/0/SrbijaPropisi/Izmene%20i%20dopune%20krivi%C4%8Dnog%20zakonika%20iz%201861.%20i%201863.%20godine.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The death penalty for theft was finally abolished only in 1902. In 1905, executions in Belgrade ceased to be public (the offenders were shot furtively in places not frequented by public), but they remained public (until 1930) in other towns and in the country, where thousands of spectators gathered for the spectacle.&lt;ref name="jankovic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|location=Belgrade|isbn=978-86-519-1232-3|pages=244–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular statistics on capital punishment began to be kept in 1889. Before that, reliable data exist for some years only. For example, in 1844 there were 62 death sentences (and 50 executions), in 1857 – 87 (10), 1868 – 64 (36) and in 1887 – 34 (23). In 1883, the year of a massive rebellion against the government (''Timočka buna''), 117 persons (mostly rebels) were sentenced to death and 47 executed. According to the official statistics, in the 25 years from 1889 to 1914 there were 600 death sentences and 344 executions.

===Yugoslavia, 1918–1941===

When Yugoslavia was created in 1918, different legal systems remained in force in different parts of the new country. In the north-western provinces (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina), executions were by hanging in an enclosed space with restricted public attendance. In the remainder of the country (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia), executions were by shooting and in public. When a single Penal Code was introduced for the whole country (1929), hanging remained the only legal mode of execution, with the exception of sentences passed by military courts, which were executed by shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|location=Belgrade|isbn=978-86-519-1232-3|pages=Ch. 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimes punished by death were mostly murder and robbery leading to death, as well as terrorism. The terrorists sentenced to death were mainly the communists and the Croatian, Macedonian and Albanian separatists.

According to the official statistics, there were 459 death sentences and 232 executions in Serbia from 1920 to 1940 (on average, 22 sentences and 11 executions per year). In the same period, in the whole of Yugoslavia there were 904 sentences and 291 executions (43 and 14 per year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistički godišnjaci Kraljevine SHS / Jugoslavije [Statistical Yearbooks of the Kingdom SHS / Yugoslavia]|year=1921–1941|location=Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hangings were performed by state executioners: [[Alois Seyfried]] (1918-1922), Florian Mausner (1922-1928) and Karlo Dragutin Hart (1928-1941).

===Yugoslavia, 1945–1991===

In the first years after World War II, death sentences were passed in large numbers daily on collaborationists and war criminals, but also on the „enemies of the people“, i.e. all those who opposed the new communist regime. There are no reliable data, but it seems likely that in Yugoslavia until 1951 there were as many as 10,000 death sentences, a majority of which were executed. In the same period, there must have been several thousands of death sentences and executions in Serbia. In addition to political offenses, capital crimes included the theft of the government property, as well as aggravated murder and robbery. Until 1959, executions were either by shooting or by hanging, as determined by the sentence of the court in each individual case, although hangings were considered as an aggravated form and were used less frequently. In the first post-war years, executions of major war criminals were often public. After 1950, the number of death sentences fell sharply. According to the official statistics, from 1950 to 1958 there were 229 death sentences in Yugoslavia (ca. 29 p.a.) and 122 in Serbia (ca. 15 p.a.). No official data were published on executions, but it is safe to assume that about two thirds of all death sentences were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|location=Belgrade|pages=Ch. 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1959 reforms resulted in a less strict system of criminal justice. Number of capital offenses was reduced and capital punishment was abolished for property offenses. Hanging was abolished and the only legal mode of execution remained shooting, performed by a platoon of eight policemen, only half of whom had rifles loaded with live ammunition. Executions could not be performed publicly. From 1959 to 1991, there were, on average, two or three executions per year in Yugoslavia and about two in Serbia (over 70% of all death sentences in Yugoslavia were passed by courts in Serbia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|pages=Ch. 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia after 1991===

From April 1992, Serbia was a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which consisted of two federal units – Serbia and Montenegro. From 1991 to 2002, Serbian courts passed 19 death sentences, none of which had been executed. On 14 February 1992, Johan Drozdek was executed in Sombor. He was sentenced to death in 1988 for rape and murder of a six-year-old girl.

== Abolition ==

===Early attempts===

In 1826, poet [[Sima Milutinović Sarajlija]] (1791–1847) wrote to Prince [[Miloš Obrenović]], advising him to abolish the death penalty. The Prince never received the letter and nothing came out of the poet’s project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karadžić|first=Vuk|title=Sabrana dela [Collected Works], XXII|year=1969|location=Belgrade|pages=227–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the drafting of the Penal Code in 1858, a law professor and a judge Jovan Filipović (1819–1876) proposed an abolition of capital punishment, arguing that it was unconstitutional under the then Serbian constitution. His proposal was rejected by a majority vote in the Drafting Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|location=Belgrade|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1881, deputies of the [[People's Radical Party]] made two motions to completely abolish the death penalty in the Serbian Parliament, but both were rejected by a majority vote. A similar motion, although restricted to an abolition for political crimes only, was made in the Parliament in 1887 and was also rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Ivan|title=Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002  [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]|year=2012|location=Belgrade|pages=172–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee appointed to draft a new constitution for Serbia in 1888 held a debate on the death penalty, but the motion to abolish it was rejected.{{fact|date=June 2017}} Another parliamentary debate was held in 1906, with the same result. Among those who spoke against capital punishment was the then minister of justice, [[Milenko Vesnić]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

In the parliamentary debates on the [[Vidovdan Constitution|draft constitution]] for the newly created Yugoslavia in 1921, the leftist parties ([[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communists]] and [[Yugoslav Republican Party|Republicans]]), as well as several smaller parties from Slovenia and Croatia, called for an abolition of the death penalty, but the majority decided to keep it in the constitution. In 1926, women’s organizations in Yugoslavia, headed by the Popular Union of Women (''Narodni ženski savez''), demanded abolition of capital punishment "for women as well as for men".{{fact|date=June 2017}}

Marxists scholars, gathered around the ''Praxis'' journal, proposed an abolition of the death penalty in 1963.{{fact|date=June 2017}} In 1980, a Belgrade lawyer [[Srđa M. Popović]] submitted a petition to the Yugoslav authorities to abolish the death penalty.{{fact|date=June 2017}} A Society Against the Death Penalty was founded in Belgrade in 1981, but the authorities refused to allow it. In 1983, more than a thousand Yugoslav citizens, mostly from Slovenia, signed a petition to the federal parliament calling for an abolition of capital punishment.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

===Partial abolition, 1992===

Constitution of FR Yugoslavia (which consisted of Serbia and Montenegro), adopted on 25 April 1992, abolished capital punishment for federal crimes (including genocide, war crimes, political and military offenses), but the federal units kept the right to prescribe capital punishment for crimes under their jurisdiction (murder and robbery).

===Final abolition, 2002===

On 26 February 2002, the Serbian parliament amended Serbia's Penal Code by deleting from it all references to capital punishment. As was stressed in the parliamentary debate, a paramount motive for this abolition was the intention of the then [[FR Yugoslavia]] to join the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smrtnakazna.rs/sr-latn-rs/teme/abolicija2002.aspx | title=Kako je Narodna skupština ukinula smrtnu kaznu u Srbiji 2002. godine? | publisher=SPSK | date=27 February 2013 | accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the abolition, there were 12 people in Serbia under the sentence of death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smrtnakazna.rs/sr-latn-rs/bazaosudjenika.aspx SPSK database]&lt;/ref&gt; Their sentence was commuted to 40 years in prison.

In 2006, new [[Constitution of Serbia]] was adopted. Article 24 of the Constitution explicitly forbids enactment of capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kurir.rs/crna-hronika/1499631/pravda-za-ubice-evo-kako-je-ukinuta-smrtna-kazna-u-srbiji | title=PRAVDA ZA UBICE: Evo kako je ukinuta smrtna kazna u Srbiji! | publisher=Kurir | date=7 August 2014 | accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

In the Fall of 2001, shortly before the Serbian abolition, a study of attitudes to the death penalty, based on a poll of 926 citizens, found the respondents to be equally divided: 43% were for the death penalty and 43% were against it, with 14% undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolić|first=Borko|title=Preživela kazna [An Obsolete Punishment]|year=2002|location=Belgrade|isbn=86-7202-051-0|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequent polls, taken every year since 2007 on a representative sample of around 1,000 citizens, confirm this result. Those for and those against capital punishment remain equally divided with minor year-to-year variations, like a seesaw: one year a majority of a few per cent would be for, and the next against the death penalty (see Table below).

'''Deep sleep therapy''' ('''DST'''), also called '''prolonged sleep treatment''' or '''continuous [[Unconsciousness|narcosis]]''', is a [[psychiatric]] treatment in which drugs are used to keep patients unconscious for a period of days or weeks.

==History==
Induction of [[sleep]] for psychiatric purposes was first tried by [[Scotland|Scottish]] psychiatrist Neil Macleod at the turn of the 20th century. He used [[bromide]]{{which|date=June 2018}} sleep in a few psychiatric patients, one of whom died. His method was adopted by some other physicians but soon abandoned, perhaps because it was considered too toxic or reckless. In 1915, Giuseppe Epifanio tried barbiturate-induced sleep therapy in a psychiatric clinic in [[Italy]], but his reports made little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Edward (1996) "The beginning of psychopharmacology: deep sleep therapies". ''European Psychiatry'' '''11''': 236s&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronarcosis]] was also developed and used for various psychiatric disorders, involving current passed through the brain to induce deep sleep.

Deep sleep therapy was popularised in the 1920s by Swiss psychiatrist [[Jakob Klaesi]], using a combination of two [[barbiturates]] marketed as Somnifen by the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]].&lt;ref&gt;Windholz G. [http://hpy.sagepub.com/content/4/13/83.abstract "Sleep as a cure for schizophrenia: a historical episode"], ''History of Psychiatry'' 4.13, March 1993, pp. 83&amp;ndash;93, doi 10.1177/0957154X9300401304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shorter97&gt;Shorter, Edward. ''A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac'', New York: Wiley, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-471-15749-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 203}} Klaesi's method became widely known and was used in some mental hospitals in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=sargant72&gt;Sargant, William; Slater, Eliot; assisted by Kelly, Desmond. ''An introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'' (Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp 100-110}} It was adopted and promoted by some leading psychiatrists in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[William Sargant]] in the United Kingdom and by [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], a North American psychiatrist of Scottish origin practising in [[Canada]], some of whose research was funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) as part of their [[Project MKULTRA]].&lt;ref name=shorter97/&gt;{{rp|pp 206-207}}

Sargant wrote in his standard textbook ''An introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many patients unable to tolerate a long course of [[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], can do so when anxiety is relieved by narcosis ... What is so valuable is that they generally have no memory about the actual length of the treatment or the numbers of ECT used ... After 3 or 4 treatments they may ask for ECT to be discontinued because of an increasing dread of further treatments. Combining sleep with ECT avoids this ... All sorts of treatment can be given while the patient is kept sleeping, including a variety of drugs and ECT [which] together generally induce considerable memory loss for the period under narcosis. As a rule the patient does not know how long he has been asleep, or what treatment, even including ECT, he has been given. Under sleep ... one can now give many kinds of physical treatment, necessary, but often not easily tolerated. We may be seeing here a new exciting beginning in psychiatry and the possibility of a treatment era such as followed the introduction of anaesthesia in surgery.&lt;ref name=sargant72/&gt;{{rp|pp. 89-96}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Australian Chelmsford scandal==
Deep sleep therapy was also practised (in combination with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) and other therapies) by [[Harry Bailey]] between 1962 and 1979 in [[Pennant Hills, New South Wales]], at the Chelmsford Private Hospital. As practised by Bailey, deep sleep therapy involved long periods of [[barbiturate]]-induced unconsciousness. It was prescribed for various conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to [[clinical depression|depression]] to [[obesity]], [[premenstrual stress syndrome]] and [[substance dependence|addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Garton S. [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170047b.htm Bailey, Harry Richard (1922-1985)]. ''Australian dictionary of national biography'' (online edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resultant deaths===
Twenty-six patients died at Chelmsford Private Hospital during the 1960s and 1970s. After the failure of the agencies of medical and criminal investigation to tackle complaints about Chelmsford, a series of articles in the early 1980s in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and television coverage on ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' exposed the abuses at the hospital, including 24 deaths from the treatment.  That forced the authorities to take action, and the [[Chelmsford Royal Commission]] was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill J.; Haupt R. The last victim of the 'beautiful hospital'. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 2 August 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]], founded by the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1969, was an advocate for victims; it received documents from the hospital, copied by a nurse, "Rosa".&lt;ref&gt;Bromberger, Brian; Fife-Yeomans, Janet. ''Deep Sleep: Harry Bailey and the Scandal of Chelmsford'', Simon &amp; Schuster 1991, page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Sydney psychiatrist Brian Boettcher had convened a meeting of doctors working at Chelmsford and found there was little support for deep sleep therapy (Bailey did not attend). However, the treatment continued to be used into 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson E. (2003) "Psychiatric abuse at Chelmsford Private Hospital, New South Wales, 1960-1980s", in Coleborne C. and MacKinnon D. ''Madness in Australia: histories, heritage and the asylum''. Queensland: 121-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Legal action on behalf of former patients was &lt;!-- removed "and is still being" - last mentioned case is 1997 --&gt; pursued in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=WalterHCA&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1992|litigants=Walton v Gardiner |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TweedaleNSWSC&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|168|1997|litigants=Susan Jane Tweedale v Dr John Tennant Herron |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HartNSWSC&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|176|1996|litigants=Hart v Herron |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient testimony===
In her book ''First Half'', [[Toni Lamond]] described what it was like when she was admitted there in 1970. She had an addiction to [[prescription drug]]s and a friend told her about Bailey and he became her psychiatrist.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was given a semi-private room.  On the way to it I saw several beds along the corridors with sleeping patients.  The patient in the other bed in my room was also asleep. I thought nothing of it at the time. Although it was mid-morning, the stillness was eerie for a hospital that looked to be full to overflowing.  I was given a handful of pills to take and the next thing I remember was Dr Bailey standing by the bed asking how I felt. I told him I'd had a good night's sleep. He laughed and informed me it was ten days later and, what's more, he had taken some weight off me. I was checked out of the hospital and this time noticed the other patients were still asleep or being taken to the bathroom while out on their feet.&lt;ref&gt;Lamond, Toni. ''First Half'', Pan Books, Sydney, 1990, {{ISBN|0 330 27185 7}}, p 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2011 controversy===
In New South Wales in 2011, following the publication of a story in the ''Sydney Morning Herald'',&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Nicky with Corderoy, Amy. [http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/ect-patients-under-anaesthetic-for-two-days-20110617-1g7ur.html ECT patients under anaesthetic for two days], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, representing the Minister for Health, in answer to a parliamentary question on notice, made a statement on the use of court-ordered prolonged sedation with ECT:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Prolonged sedation is used on rare occasions with the administration of ECT where there has been a clinical indication to combine the two procedures, such as in complex cases when the risk to the patient and others from severe mental illness is extreme and other treatments have been unable to safely contain this risk. The primary purpose of the sedation is to keep the patient and staff safe from the patient's severe aggression and to control agitation. The primary purpose of the ECT is to treat the underlying mental illness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9535">'''Emergency medical services in [[Israel]]''' are provided by the [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA) organization, supplemented in some areas by [[Hatzalah]], and the [[Palestinian Red Crescent Society]].

==Organization==

===Land Ambulance===
[[Image:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|Armoured Mobile Intensive Care Unit]]
MDA and United Hatzalah are the nationally recognized EMS organizations of the State of Israel.
MDA consists of approx. 14,000 volunteers and 1850 employees, Paramedics and first responders. The organization operates 95 stations with a fleet of over 728 ambulances.  The majority of the fleet consists of [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS) ambulances. These are supplemented by [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) ambulances, [[Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance|mobile intensive care unit]]s (MICU) and a variety of first responders. In an unusual feature, [[armored ambulance]]s are not uncommon nationwide.   The system is highly dependent on volunteers, many of whom are from outside of Israel.  As a recognized [[national aid society]], according to the [[Geneva Conventions]] MDA may become an auxiliary arm of the [[Israeli Defence Force]] during wartime.  
Most major stations also include special units for responding to mass-casualty incidents like natural disasters or terrorist attacks.  The system, for the most part, used to conform to the Franco-German (as opposed to the Anglo-American) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German  emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= 10.1017/s1049023x00000650|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies was not uncommon.  As of 2015 MDA no longer employs physicians on its ALS/MICU ambulances, volunteer physicians may still be encountered in the field but employee physicians' main task is to provide on-line medical support through a special hot-line.
United Hatzalah consists of 3,200 volunteers, that provide completely free services. The United Hatzalah volunteers utilize various vehicles, including ambucycles, e-bikes, ambuboats, and etc. to reach the patients in their most vital time of need. They are Israel's first on the scene, first responders. Across Israel, United Hatzalah has a response time of 3 minutes, and in Jerusalem a response time of 90 seconds. United Hatzalah is known not only for their fast response times, but also their inclusiveness. United Haztalah has hundreds of Arab, Christian and Druze volunteers, coming together for the sake of saving lives. United Hatzalah offers many services, including EMS response, the world's first Psychotrauma Unit which treats emotional injuries at the scene of traumatic incidents, and the Ten Kavod program, which provides free weekly medical care to at risk seniors, including survivors of the Holocaust.
In addition, emergency ambulance service is supplemented by a variety of private carriers who are tasked with interfacility transfers only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ambulanceisrael.com/?page_id=5 | title=Ambulance Israel website| accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Ambulance===
[[Image:IAF-AS-565.jpg|thumb|Prior to 2008, air ambulance service was provided by the military.]]
Air ambulance service was provided by [[Israeli Air Force]] [[MEDEVAC]] [[helicopters]], however, in 2008 civil HEMS was introduced by Magen David Adom in partnership with a private company called Lahak Aviation Ltd, utilizing four [[Germany|German]]-made [[MBB Bo 105]]s staffed with MDA paramedics.  Lahak deployed them throughout the country in order to improve response times in peripheral areas. Previous attempts to integrate independent helicopter service in the 1970s were unsuccessful due to high cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=740a002d-49f9-4da1-99e7-660482976627|title=Rotorhub website|accessdate=2008-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-emergency and repatriation air ambulance service is normally provided by a variety of private charter carriers such as Arrow Aviation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrowaviation.biz/medical-flights.php?lang=en|title=Air Ambulance website|accessdate=2011-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113718/http://www.arrowaviation.biz/medical-flights.php?lang=en|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==

===Vehicles===
[[Image:Mda motorcycle.JPG|thumb|MDA First Responder]]
Most of the fleet is made up of regular size vans staffed by "medics" (Hovesh) and "advanced medics" (Hovesh Bachir) as well as an additional Hovesh or a first responder, and advanced life support ambulances, staffed by paramedics; mobile intensive care units, staffed by paramedics, respond only to the most medically serious cases.  The vehicles compare in general terms with American or European ambulances, however compliance with either the [[KKK 1822]] or [[CEN 1789]] standard is not compulsory.  In addition, first responders will often proceed to calls in their own vehicles, and could be anything from a private car to a motor scooter.

[[United Hatzalah]] was the first organization in Israel to create motorcycles equipped with life-saving equipment, Ambucycles. Ambucycles enable the EMT rider to beat traffic and congestion, allowing for United Hatzalah's quick 3 minute and less response time.  Currently, United Hatzlah has a fleet of 500 Ambucycles.

===Training and staffing===

As previously stated, the MDA uses a broad range of staff from First Responders to Paramedics, and both volunteers and paid staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ellis DY, Sorene E |title=Magen David Adom: The EMS in Israel|journal=Resuscitation|volume=76|year=2008|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=19976417|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.07.014|pages=5–10|pmid=17767990|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First responders typically receive 60 hours of training to prepare them for their roles.  Paid employees are required to be certified at the Hovesh level, which requires approximately 170–200 hours of training.  The next step is the Hovesh Bachir (EMT-I) which requires a further four weeks of training or a part-time 180 additional hours of training.  Those certified at the Hovesh level (EMT-B) are permitted to operate AEDs and to start IVs.([[Automated external defibrillator|AED]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-ems.com/il.htm|title=International EMS website|accessdate=2008-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129090730/http://international-ems.com/il.htm|archivedate=2009-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paramedics may be trained over a period of 15 months, with nine months of didactic and hospital clinical time, and a six-month preceptorship with a qualified paramedic on a mobile intensive care unit ambulance.  Increasingly, however, paramedics are choosing another option; obtaining a three-year B.EMS degree in Emergency Medicine from Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva or Zefat Academic College in Zefat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Levy G, Goldstein L, Erez Y, Levite R |title=Physician versus Paramedic in the Setting of Ground Forces Operations: Are They Interchangeable?|journal=Military Medicine|volume=March 2007|pages=2|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3912/is_200703/ai_n18755588/pg_2|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an unusual move aimed at raising revenue to offset operating costs, MDA has begun to market its expertise at emergency care and system organization on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdais.org/e/316/3665.htm|title=MDA Training website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have achieved some success in this endeavour, assisting the nation of [[Chile]] with the development of a national EMS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Mashav%20%E2%80%93%20International%20Development/Publications/1999/Operating%20a%20National%20Emergency%20Medical%20Service%20Net|title=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispatch===
Ambulances are dispatched from regional dispatch centres, except during wars or other emergencies when service is provided from a national dispatch centre.  This centre uses dispatch technologies such as Automatic Vehicle Locating ([[Automatic vehicle location|AVL]]) and decision-support software that are comparable with U.S. and European systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-89862917.html|title=Jerusalem Post article|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The national emergency number for an ambulance in Israel is 101.  This number is answered by MDA around the clock.

===Response times===
According to 2011 figures, the average MDA ambulance response time in Israel is 9 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=שימוש במודל אופטימיזציה לקביעת נקודות הזנקה של אמבולנסים|url=http://www.igudbit.org.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=3189&amp;CategoryID=420|website=Israeli Insurance Companies Association's Research Institute|trans-title=An optimization model for the determination of the placement of ambulance dispatch stations|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional symbiosis''' is when an individual has the limited capacity to be aware of, respect, appreciate, and comprehend the subjectivity of another. This occurs in the phase of early development when a child is completely dependent, and both physically and emotionally closely bonded with their mother. Emotional symbiosis is a very common occurrence as it originates from the early childhood treatment of babies. People who have emotional symbiosis tend to put others down in order to make themselves feel as if they have all of the right answers. Emotional symbiosis is usually handed down through generations and can have a negative impact on one's family life.

== Average psychological stages of life ==

=== 1. Infant – Basic Trust vs. Mistrust ===

In [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory]], he believes that once babies are born, the first phase that they have to go through is figuring out whether the people that they are around are trustworthy or untrustworthy. Babies begin to trust the people that are around them by giving them their basic needs – care, food, and attention. Once infants have a bond with a person that has fulfilled their needs, they begin to put their trust into that individual.

=== 2. Toddler – Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt ===

Once infants begin to form into toddlers, they begin to test out their freedoms and the extent that they should go with their freedoms. For example, a baby may want to play with the scissors on the ground, but once a parent snatches those scissors away from them, they begin to realize what they are expected to touch and not to touch. Also, they feel shameful because they notice the unhappy expressions that are on their parent's faces.

=== 3. Preschool/Early Childhood – Initiative and Guilt ===

As children began to grow into their early childhood phase, they begin to take charge of their actions and see how far they can go until someone stops these actions. A child may shred paper on the ground and laugh, but once they get caught, they will feel guilty because they know that they were not supposed to do that certain action. Again, in this phase, children try to find out the extent that they can go until someone stops them.

=== 4. School Age/Play – Industry vs. Inferiority ===

As a child begins to grow, they fully realize that they are children are expected to act in a certain type of manner. A question that children may ask themselves in this phase is, "Can I make it in the world of people and things?". Children typically began to realize how small they are in the world during this phase, and how much they are able to achieve on their own.

=== 5. Adolescence – Identity vs. Role Confusion ===

In this phase, peer influence really begins to take control of an adolescent's mind. Children began to wonder, "where do I truly belong?", and the way that most children find out who they really are is through peer influences, which can be positive influences or negative.

=== 6. Young Adulthood – Intimacy vs. Isolation ===

When an individual is transforming into a young adult, a common question in their mind is, essentially, "can I love?". In this phase, an individual begins to wonder if there is someone for them in the world, if they will ever find love, or if love just isn't for them. Also, they wonder if it's better to be in a relationship, single, or just completely be alone.

=== 7. Adulthood – Generativity vs. Stagnation ===

In this stage, an individual wonders whether or not they want to contribute to the society. In '''Generativity''', the individual would want to set an example for the generations to come, and leave their mark on society. On the other hand, a person who chooses '''Stagnation''' would care less for the society and the generations who are coming. People who are in favor of Stagnation are usually self-absorbed and would rather focus on their own well being.

=== 8. Old Age – Ego Integrity vs. Despair ===

In this final stage of life, people began to figure out whether they are mentally prepared to move onto the next stage of life, whatever they choose to believe in. The other alternative is to stay as strong as they possibly can to remain on Earth and make these last moments of life count. When an individual is in Despair, they focus on death more than the last moments that they have on Earth. On the other hand, a person who chooses to have ego integrity chooses to make the best of their life, and they have more confidence for what's ahead of them in the future.

=== Separation-individuation theory of child development ===

This theory, created by [[Margaret Mahler]], explains how infants begin to get self-absorbed in 3 phases. These phases are the normal autistic phase, normal symbiotic phase, and the separation-individuation phase.
==== Normal autistic phase ====

This phase shows that infants are usually self-absorbed, because they spend most of them time sleeping and crying, and spending less time actually trying to figure out the world that they are living in and the people they are around.

==== Normal symbiotic phase ====

In the normal symbiotic phase, infants grow a very close connection with themselves and their mother. This relationship is very essential to them, and they focus on this relationship more than they focus on the outside world. During this phase, the infant realizes that it is living in order to please its mother.

==== Separation-individuation phase ====
This is the phase where an infant begins to separate from its mother in order to find out its purpose in the world. This phase is divided into 3 subcategories that go further in depth into how infants begin to grow into an individual.

===== 1. Hatching (first months) =====
 – In this phase, infants begin to have a certain alertness about the outside world, and they're wanting to look at the world in a more enthusiastic way.

===== 2. Practicing (9–16 months) =====
 – In this phase, usually, infants begin to crawl and look for ways to explore their surroundings.

===== 3. Rapprochement (15–24 months) =====
 – In this phase, the infant wants to further explore the world, but wants to have the mother's attention throughout their exploration. If the mother doesn't pay attention to the child's enthusiasm to observe their surroundings, the infant may feel abandoned or anxious.

During the war, she created two courses at [[McGill University Faculty of Education]]&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt; and was asked to work in [[Toronto]] as a professor in 1917.&lt;ref name="uoft"/&gt; While in Toronto, she worked at the [[Military School of Orthopaedic Surgery and Physiotherapy]] and co-created a diploma in physiotherapy at the [[University of Toronto]] with her second husband.&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

Outside of education, Graham co-founded the [[Canadian Association of Massage and Remedial Gymnastics]] in 1920, which was later renamed to the [[Canadian Physiotherapy Association]]. During World War II, she established a military committee for the CPA and was named an honourary president in 1961.&lt;ref name="uoft"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Graham was previously married with two children when her first husband died in 1922. She later married again in 1929 and had a child together.&lt;ref name="uoft"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enid Gordon Graham nominated to the Historical Sites and Monuments Board of Canada |url=http://www.physicaltherapy.utoronto.ca/news-events/enid-gordon-graham-nominated-historical-sites-monuments-board-canada/|website=Physical Therapy University of Toronto |accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
In 1979, Graham was posthumously honoured by the Canadian Physiotherapy Association with the creation of the [[Enid Graham Memorial Lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#PTHistory: Enid Graham |url=http://www.physicaltherapy.utoronto.ca/news-events/pthistory-enid-graham/|website=Physical Therapy University of Toronto|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Graham was named a [[Person of National Historic Significance]] of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham, Enid Gordon (1894-1974) National Historic Person|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=14312 |website=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a memorial dedicated to her was unveiled at the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enid Gordon Graham Memorial Plaque|url=https://physiotherapy.ca/enid-gordon-graham|website=Canadian Physiotherapy Association|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''environmental impact of paint''' is diverse. Traditional [[painting]] materials and processes can have harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including those from the use of [[lead]] and other additives.  Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so waste is minimized, and use of environmentally preferred paints, coating, painting accessories, and techniques.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] &lt;!-- ratings are some of the --&gt; standards &lt;!-- that --&gt; can be applied.

==Issues==

===Low-VOC and other environmentally preferred paints===
[[Volatile organic compound]]s are gases emitted by various solids or liquids, many of which have short- and long-term adverse health effects.  Solvents in traditional paints often contain high quantities of VOCs.  Low VOC paints improve indoor air quality and reduce urban smog.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  The beneficial characteristics of such paints include low odor, clean air, and safer technology, as well as excellent durability and a washable finish.

Low-VOC paint types include latex (water-based), recycled latex (water-based), [[acrylic paint|acrylic]], and milk paint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cms/groups/pan/@pan/@sustainableblding/documents/web_informational/dpds_007583.pdf Seattle Public Utilities Sustainable Building Program Pages:4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/construction-demand-boosts-local-eco-friendly-paints-2017-03-10|title=Engineering News - Demand for ecofriendly paint expected to rise as building outlook improves|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The labels of paint cans can be checked for the following information:

* To be considered  low-VOC, the paint should contain &lt;50&amp;nbsp;g/l of VOC.
* To be considered zero-VOC, the paint should contain &lt;5 g/l of VOC.
* Solid content usually ranges from 25–45%, higher solid percentages indicate less VOCs.&lt;ref&gt;[Loux, Renee(2008), Easy Green Living The ultimate guide to simple, ecofriendly choices for you and your home. Pages:311]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, items containing toxic ingredients have registration numbers with either the:
#US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] '''(EPA)'''
#[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] '''(OSHA)'''
#[[United States Department of Transportation]] '''(DOT)'''

===Antifouling paint===
{{main|Anti-fouling paint}}
Antifouling paint (or bottom paint) is used to protect the hulls of boats from [[fouling]] by marine organisms. Antifouling paint protects the surface from corrosion and prevents drag on the ship from any build-up of marine organisms. These paints have contained [[organotin]] compounds such as [[tributyltin]], which are considered to be toxic chemicals with negative effects on humans and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pic.int/incs/crc3/n14)/English/K0654009%20CRC3-14.pdf |title=Draft Decision Guidance Document for Tributyltin Compounds |last=Secretariat for the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade |date=26 November 2006 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2008-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016222937/http://www.pic.int/incs/crc3/n14%29/English/K0654009%20CRC3-14.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tributyltin compounds are moderately to highly [[persistent organic pollutant]]s that bioconcentrate up the marine predators' food chain.  One common example is it leaching from marine paints into the aquatic environment, causing irreversible damage to the aquatic life. Tributyltin has also been linked to obesity in humans, as it triggers genes that cause the growth of fat cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | author=Staff | date=2008-12-03
 | title=Persistent Pollutant May Promote Obesity
 | publisher=Science daily | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081201081921.htm | accessdate=2008-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

Tributyltin is harmful to some marine organisms, including the [[dog whelk]], it causes dog whelks to suffer from [[imposex]]; females develop male sexual characteristics such as a penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0025-326X(95)00120-C |author1=Dan Minchin |author2=Eberhard Stroben |author3=Jörg Oehlmann |author4=Barbara Bauer |author5=Colm B. Duggan |author6=Michael Keatinge | title = Biological indicators used to map organotin contamination in Cork Harbour, Ireland | year = 1996 | journal = Marine Pollution Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes them to become infertile or even die. In severe cases, males can develop egg sacs.

Alternatives include [[biomimetic antifouling coating]]s.

===Heavy metals===
[[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metal]]s are used in paints and have raised concerns due to their toxicity at high levels of exposure and since they build up in the [[food chain]].
;Lead
{{main|Lead paint}}
Lead paint contains [[lead]] as pigment. Lead is also added to paint to speed drying, increase durability, retain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. Paint with significant lead content is still used in industry and by the military. For example, leaded paint is sometimes used to paint roadways and parking lot lines. Lead, a poisonous metal, can damage nerve connections (especially in young children) and cause blood and brain disorders. Because of lead's low reactivity and solubility, [[lead poisoning]] usually only occurs in cases when it is dispersed, such as when sanding lead-based paint prior to repainting.

;Chromium
[[Primer (paint)|Primer paint]] containing [[hexavalent chromium]] is still widely used for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]] refinishing applications. [[Zinc chromate]] has been used as a pigment for artists' paint, known as [[zinc yellow]] or yellow 36. It is highly toxic and now rarely used.

==Mitigation==
As a response to the environmental and health concerns, some paint manufacturers now offer [[environmentally friendly]] alternatives. Also, in some countries, [[paint recycling]] is carried out on surplus paints and resold.

Products like [[ECOBOND]] LBP are available to treat lead.  Ecobond can chemically change lead to make it less leechable and, therefore, easier on the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3053">The term [[farm assurance]] was first used in [[Scotland]] in the late 1980s to describe new [[Product certification|certification]] schemes established by farmers, meat processors, consumers and supporting agencies, in response to emerging consumer concerns about food production. Organisations involved included the [[National Farmers Union of Scotland]], [[Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers]], the [[Scottish Consumer Council]], [[Scottish Enterprise]], [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|Highlands and Islands Development Board]], the [[Meat and Livestock Commission]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College]]. These schemes introduced independent, on-farm auditing of [[animal welfare]], environmental care and staff competence.  

The first farm assurance scheme was the Scottish Pig Industry Initiative, established in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfqc.co.uk/farm_schemes/quality_meat_scotland_qms_assurance_schemes_-_pigs |title= Quality Meat Scotland Assurance Scheme – Pigs |publisher=Scottish Food Quality Certification |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Farm Assured Scotch Lamb and Scottish Quality Cereals.  Food produced through these schemes carry Scotch and Scottish branding (e.g. Scotch Beef).  Other farming sectors in Scotland quickly followed. Scottish [[farmed salmon]] producers established similar assurance schemes (Scottish Quality Salmon and Shetland Quality Salmon) during the same period, followed by farmed trout (Scottish Quality Trout).  Farmers in England established their own (and sometimes UK-wide) farm assurance schemes in the second half of the 1990s, these eventually being encompassed within [[Assured Food Standards]] which operates the "Red Tractor" mark.   The rest of Europe took up farm assurance in the late 1990s (e.g. EurepGap) with many other parts of the world adopting farm assurance in the early 2000s (e.g. GlobalGap).   

The individuals who established farm assurance in Scotland included Maitland Mackie (SPII Chair), Jim Royan (FASL Chair), John Ross (NFUS President), John MacNaughton (SQBLA Chair), Alistair Donaldson (MLC Scotland Director), Brian Simpson (SQBLA Chief Executive), Ian Duncan Miller (livestock farmer), Alan Stevenson (SAMW), David Jack (cereal farmer), David Taylor (Scottish Enterprise), George Russell (Scottish Enterprise) and Peter Brown (HIDB then SPII &amp; FASL Chief Executive).

== Scottish Food Quality Certification ==
Scottish Food Quality Certification is an independent company which monitors Scottish farm produce.  Founded in 1995 it was the world's first farm and food certification business accredited to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Guide 65. By the late 1990s SFQC certified approximately 15,000 farms (circa 90% of Scottish farm output).

== Health status ==
A new measure of expected [[human capital]] calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in September 2018. [[Finland]] had the highest level of expected human capital: 28·4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Stephen |last2=et |first2=al |title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alcohol consumption ===
The total annual alcohol consumption has risen from 7.6 litres (in 1985) to 10.0 litres of 100% alcohol equivalent per capita in 2010. There has been a small reduction in alcohol consumption in the recent years. Alcohol use is highest in the Northern Finland with 10,9 liters and lowest at the Åland Islands with 5,7 liters per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stakes.fi/tilastot/tilastotiedotteet/2011/Tr16_11.pdf |title=Alkoholijuomien kulutus 2010 |work=Terveyden ja Hyvinvoinnin Laitos |year=2011 |language=Finnish |accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the consumption is average to other western countries, binge drinking with especially teenagers and becoming intoxicated has remained as a characteristic of Finnish drinking habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paihdelinkki.fi/Articles/111-alcohol-use-in-finland |title=Alcohol use in Finland |work=National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (Stakes) |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424014822/http://www.paihdelinkki.fi/Articles/111-alcohol-use-in-finland |archivedate=2008-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland has a national alcohol programme to reduce the [[long-term effects of alcohol]]. The [[World Health Organization]] has published a [[list of countries by alcohol consumption]].

=== Smoking rates ===
{{See|Smoking in Finland}}

[[File:Smokers-as-a-percentage-of-adult-pop.jpg|thumb|300px|The percentage of Finish adults who smoked in 2011.]]
[[Smoking]] among adults has shown a marked decline over the past thirty years in most OECD countries. Much of this decline also in Finland can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. [[Smoking in Finland]] has reduced, and now the smoking rates among adults in Finland in 2009 stood at 18.6%, lower than the OECD average of 22.3%.&lt;ref name = "oecd2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/44/40904932.pdf |title=How Does Finland Compare |work=OECD Health Data 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug usage ===
[[Substance abuse|Drug use]] is not a major public health problem in Finland. The most commonly used drug is [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. According to a study from 2008, the percentage of the population aged 15 to 69 who had at some point in their lives tried cannabis was 13%; 3% of the population had used cannabis within the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/7445c896-5bc1-4bbc-b9e3-f41be4fa94e5 |title=Drug Situation in Finland 2010 |work=National Institute for Health and Welfare |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obesity ===
Overweight and obesity are common in Finland. Half of the adults are overweight, and every fifth adult is obese. The weight in men has increased since 1970’s, in women since 1980’s. Among the Nordic countries Finland ranks the highest in a percentage of adults who are overweight. In comparison to other European countries, Finland is slightly above the average but overweight is still more common in South Europe and Great Britain. Overweight among children and adolescents has also become widespread. The number of overweight 12- to 18-year-olds has nearly tripled in the past four decades. 10% of boys and 15% of girls in preschool were overweight in a follow-up from 2007 to 2009&lt;ref name = "Lihavuuden yleisyys Suomessa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thl.fi/en/tutkimus-ja-asiantuntijatyo/hankkeet-ja-ohjelmat/kansallinen-lihavuusohjelma-20122015/lihavuus-lukuina/lihavuuden-yleisyys-suomessa |title=Lihavuuden yleisyys Suomessa |language=Finnish |work=THL |accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===

[[HIV/AIDS]] is not a major [[public health]] concern in Finland. The [[prevalence]] among adult population on 2009 was 0.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-aids-europe.htm |title=European HIV and AIDS statistics |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HIV/AIDS in Europe]] is much more common than in Finland, and the countries very near to Finland have much higher prevalence rates, due to increased travel HIV/AIDS rates in Finland may rise. It had the lowest rate of death from communicable diseases in Europe (9 per 100,000) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncommunicable diseases===

The most significant [[public health]] problems are currently circulatory diseases, cancer, muscoloskeletal diseases and mental health problems. Emerging problems are [[obesity]], chronic lung diseases and type 2 [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name = "hit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/80692/E91937.pdf |title=Finland - Health system review 2008|work=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300 000 Finns are diagnosed with diabetes. Approximately 200 000 suffer from type 2 diabetes unknowingly and many more have prediabetes. The number of people with diabetes are estimated to double in 10 years. Most of the incidences could be prevented with healthy life styles, i.e. sufficient level of physical activity, obtaining normal weight and eating healthy.&lt;ref name =Diabetes &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thl.fi/fi/aiheet/tietopaketit/diabetes |title=Diabetes |work=THL |language=Finnish |accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major causes of deaths in Finland are cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumors, dementia and alzheimers disease, respiratory diseases, alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.fi/til/ksyyt/2009/01/ksyyt_2009_01_2011-02-22_kat_002_en.html |title=Causes of Death 2009 |work=Statistics Finland |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the leading causes of death among men aged 15 to 64 were alcohol related deaths, ischaemic heart disease, accident, suicides, lung cancer and cerbrovascular diseases.&lt;ref name ="Leading causes of death among men aged 15 to 64 in 2010" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ksyyt/2010/ksyyt_2010_2011-12-16_kuv_001_en.html |title=Leading causes of death among men aged 15 to 64 in 2010 |work=Official Statistics of Finland |accessdate=2014-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among women the leading causes were breast cancer, alcohol related deaths, accidents, suicides, ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer.&lt;ref name ="Leading causes of death among women aged 15 to 64 in 2010" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ksyyt/2010/ksyyt_2010_2011-12-16_kuv_002_en.html |title=Leading causes of death among women aged 15 to 64 in 2010 |work=Official Statistics of Finland |accessdate=2014-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proportional mortality.jpg|thumb|Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, both sexes)]]

===Mental health===

[[Suicide]] mortality in Finland has generally been one of the highest in Europe, but it has reduced to 18 per 100 000 population in
2005. One reason for this may be the large national suicide prevention project which was carried out between 1986 and 1996.&lt;ref name = "hit"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] has compiled a [[list of countries by suicide rate]]. There is a high level of education of mental health workers in Finland and several effective mental health programs have been conducted within at-risk groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stm.fi/en/pressreleases/pressrelease/-/view/1887214#en |title=The OECD: Finland must make mental health services more widely accessible |publisher=STM |date= |accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moldova]]n state has a [[universal health care]] system. 

== Overview ==
The Republic of Moldova became independent in 1991. Since that time the country has become a parliamentary republic and has embarked on an ambitious programme of economic reform. Agriculture and food processing dominate the economy and the country is dependent on imports for its energy needs. Economic transition has caused great socioeconomic hardship in the country and the health status of the population has fallen. There has been a steep rise in the death rate and there has been large-scale labour migration – currently 40% of the working age population works abroad and remittances account for 30% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care in Moldova known dynamic development in the past years, the hospitals being equipped with ultra-modern equipment, the new surgical blocks and general medical departments being built in Chisinau - capital city. The birth rate is at one and a half children per woman.&lt;ref name="UNDP Human Development Indicators Moldova"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moldova (Republic of): Human Development Indicators |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/MDA |publisher=[[Human Development Report]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public expenditure on health was 4.2% of the GDP and private expenditure on health 3.2%.&lt;ref name="UNDP Human Development Indicators Moldova"/&gt;  There are about 264 physicians per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="UNDP Human Development Indicators Moldova"/&gt;  Health expenditure was 138 US$ (PPP) per capita in 2004. In 2011, accordingly to World Bank, the  health expenditures per capita was at about 223 US$.&lt;ref name="UNDP Human Development Indicators Moldova"/&gt;

== Health system ==
The reform of health financing in the Republic of Moldova began in earnest in 2004 with the introduction of a mandatory health insurance (MHI) system. Since then, MHI has become a sustainable financing mechanism that has improved the technical and allocative efficiency of the system as well as overall transparency. This has helped to further consolidate the prioritization of primary care in the system, which has been bas ed on a family medicine model since the 1990s. Hospital stock in the country has been reduced since independence as the country inherited a Semashko health system with excessive infrastructure, but there is still room for efficiency gains, particularly through the consolidation of specialist services in the capital city. The rationalization of duplicated specialized services, therefore, remains a key challenge facing the Moldovan health system. Other challenges include health workforce shortages (particularly in rural areas) and improving equity in financing and access to care by reducing out of pocket (OOP) payments. OOP spending on health is dominated by the cost of pharmaceuticals and this is currently a core focus of reform efforts. &lt;ref&gt; UNICEF. Media Center.

== Health status ==
===Main causes of death===
The Republic of Moldova has a double epidemiological burden as rates of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases have steadily increased since independence. The main causes of death in the Republic of Moldova are diseases of the circulatory system followed by cancer and diseases of the digestive system. Many of these deaths can be attributed to very heavy alcohol and tobacco consumption – 57.6% of total male mortality and 62.3% of female mortality in 2010 could be attributed to smoking-related causes while 18.8% of male mortality and 13.7% of female mortality were related to alcohol consumption. Though incidence of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis has decreased over the last five years, this remains a very significant overall cause of mortality in the Republic of Moldova (118.95 per population of 100 000 men and 89.82 per population of 100 000 women in 2010). &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Main causes of death. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
The economic and social crises have negatively influenced the population's mental health: a continuous increase in the incidence of mental health disorders has been registered (500.22 per 100 000 general population in 2005 and 576.13 per 100 000 general population in 2009).&lt;ref&gt; Gapminder.

Mental health. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis===
However, the key challenges in communicable disease control in the Republic of Moldova are tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS. Incidence of TB has been rising since 1990 and has more than doubled, reaching 182 per 100 000 population in 2010, the most dramatic increase being registered in children. The TB mortality rate increased from 16.9 per 100 000 people in 2000 to 23 in 2010, and rates in prisons are even much higher. &lt;ref&gt; World Health Organization. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child health===
Moldova is among the few countries in the world which reached its Millennium objective of reducing child mortality, registering a mortality rate of 13.4 to 1,000 live births in 2011 in children under 5 (compared to 23.3 in 2000). The most frequent causes of young children’s deaths in Moldova are accidents, intoxications, traumas, as well as diseases of the respiratory apparatus – causes which can be prevented if parents and caregivers would supervise children better.  &lt;ref&gt; UNICEF. Moldova.
https://www.unicef.org/moldova/media_20438.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infant mortality'''
The infant mortality rate has been falling steadily since the mid-1990s reaching 11.8 per 1000 live births in 2010, which is close to average for countries of the CIS (11.7 per 1000 live births in 2010), but still more than double the European Union average of 4.2 per 1000 live births in 2010. Maternal mortality levels have fluctuated widely, reaching a low of 16 per 100 000 births in 2006 and 21 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2013. This is almost double the average for countries of the European Union, which was 6.1 in 2010. However, actual numbers are low (18 in 2010, 7 in 2009) and as there are only around 40 000 births annually each tragic death increases the maternal mortality rate substantially. &lt;ref&gt; World Health Organization.Infant mortality. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Child immunization'''
Child immunization levels have been consistently high in the Republic of Moldova for all vaccine-preventable diseases, and in 2010, 97.1% of children were immunized against measles, 97.9% of infants were vaccinated against TB, 97.4% against polio and 97.6% against hepatitis B. The combined vaccination
for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) covered 89.8% of infants in 2010, and vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b covered 61.2% of infants. &lt;ref&gt;  World Health Organization. Immunization. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;Sexually transmitted infections sharply increased following independence, with syphilis showing one of the biggest increases (71.51 per 100 000 population in 2008). &lt;ref&gt; World Health Organization.

== Life expectancy   ==
Despite the Republic of Moldova being the poorest country in the WHO European Region, life expectancy estimates are 2–5 years higher than similar estimates for considerably richer countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), namely 69.13 years in 2010. Mortality rates are particularly high for the working age population – and the reduction of life expectancy through death before 65 years of age was 12 years for men and 6.4 years for women in 2010. This has contributed to a significant and growing gender gap in life expectancy: 64.86 for males and 73.5 years for females in 2010. This is also reflected in disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALE), which was 58 years for men and 63 years for women in 2007. &lt;ref&gt; World Health Organization. Life expectancy. Moldova. http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/republic-of-moldova/data-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergency aid ==
The largest national emergency aid service is concentrated and is being in service within Chisinau - the capital region of Moldova. Nowadays in Chisinau operate 60 ambulance municipal cars, instead of 92 how is required and a douzen cars of private emergency service - Calmed. Everyday there are registered and served 800 emergency calls within Chisinau and more than 2000 emergency calls within the whole Moldova per day. The core of emergency system in Chisinau is National Scientific and Practical Centre for Emergency Medicine, having 620 beds, enrolling 3138 of personnel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12480">A '''hearing protection devices''', also known as a '''HPD''', is an [[ear protection]] device worn in or over the ears while exposed to hazardous [[noise]] to protect against [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. HPDs reduce (not eliminate) the level of the noise entering the ear. HPDs can also protect against other effects of [[Health effects from noise|noise exposure]] such as [[tinnitus]] and [[hyperacusis]]. There are many different types of HPDs available for use, including [[earmuffs]], [[Earplug|earplugs]], electronic hearing protection devices, and semi-insert devices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Types ==
[[File:Serre tête.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Earmuff hearing protection device.]]

=== Earmuffs ===
[[File:Types of Earplugs.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Different styles of earplugs are pictured. Left, pre-molded earplugs. Center, formable earplugs. Right, roll-down foam earplugs.]]

[[Earmuffs|Earmuff]] style hearing protection devices are designed to fit over the outer ear, or [[Auricle (anatomy)|pinna]]. Earmuff HPDs typically consist of two ear cups and a head band. Ear cups are usually lined with a sound-absorbing material, such as foam. The cups should be fit so that the center of the ear canal aligns with the ear canal opening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The soft cushions seal around the [[Pinna (anatomy|pinna]] of the ears. The head band, centered at the top of the head, applies force/pressure to seal the ear cups over the ears.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Earplugs ===
[[Earplug]] style hearing protection devices are designed to fit in the [[ear canal]]. Earplugs come in a variety of different subtypes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Pre-molded earplugs''' have a preformed shape and a push-to-fit design. 
* '''Formable earplugs''' are pliable and take the form of an individual's ear canal. 
* '''Roll-down foam earplugs''' are one of the most commonly used earplugs, and are made from slow recovery foam which expands after it has been "rolled-down" and inserted in the ear canal, creating a tighter seal. 
* '''Custom Earplugs''' are made individually for each user following ear impressions. Typically custom earplugs are purchased from an [[Audiology|audiology clinic]] or hearing healthcare professional. 

=== Electronic hearing protection devices ===
Some HPDs reduce the sound reaching the [[eardrum]] through a combination of electronic and structural components. Electronic HPDs are available in both [[Earmuffs|earmuff]] and custom [[earplug]] styles. Electronic microphones, circuitry, and receivers perform [[Active noise control|active noise reduction]], also known as [[Active noise control|noise-cancelling]], in which a signal that is 180-degrees out-of-phase of the noise is presented, which in theory cancels the noise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation: In Occupational, Recreational, Educational, and Home Settings|last=Rawool|first=Vishakha Waman|publisher=Thieme|year=2011|isbn=1604062576|location=|pages=136-173|chapter=Chapter 6: Hearing Protection and Enhancement Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bouchon ER25 - Elacin.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Custom earplug hearing protection devices.]]
Some electronic HPDs, known as Hearing Enhancement Protection Systems,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; provide hearing protection from high-level sounds while allowing transmission of other sounds like speech. Some also have the ability to amplify low-level sounds. This type may be beneficial for users who are in noisy environments, but still need access to lower level sounds. For example, [[soldier]]s who need to protect their hearing but also need to be able to identify enemy forces and communicate in noise, [[Hunting|hunters]] who rely on detecting and localizing soft sounds of [[wildlife]] but still wish to protect their hearing from recreational [[firearm]] blasts, as well as users with pre-existing [[hearing loss]] who are in noisy environments may all benefit from Hearing Enhancement Protection Systems.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Electronic HPDs require the use of [[Zinc–air battery|batteries]] and are typically more expensive than non-electronic types. 

=== Semi-insert devices (canal caps) ===
Canal caps are similar to earplugs in that they consists of soft tip that is inserted into the opening of the ear canal. Some styles are inserted slightly into the ear canal while others sit in place at the opening of the ear canal. In this case, the tips or caps are connected by a lightweight band which also serves to hold them in position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hygiene and care ==
In order to prevent irritation or infection of the ear, HPDs should be cleaned on a regular basis. Before using any HPD, it should be inspected for damage or dirt to ensure that it is safe to use. Single-use, disposable earplugs are available in addition to reusable options.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Most reusable earplugs can be cleaned using mild soap and warm water between uses and should be replaced every 2-4 weeks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howardleight.com/assets/attachments/391/care-maintenance.pdf?1441738269|title=Care/Maintenance of Earplugs and Earmuffs|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Howard Leight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earmuffs|Earmuff]] cups and cushions should be cleaned regularly and be replaced if they become cracked or otherwise compromised. Ear cushions can last from 3-8 months depending on use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Use of a clean, protective case to store your HPDs when not in use is recommended to prevent damage or contamination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Any damage to a HPD can compromise its integrity, thus reducing its effectiveness. Damaged HPDs should not be used.

== Recommended use ==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2018}}
Use of hearing protection devices is recommended by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Audiology|audiologists]] and other hearing healthcare professionals when exposure to noise meets or exceeds 85 [[A-weighting|dB-A]] as an 8-hour [[Time-weighted average (PEL)|time-weighted average]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This level of noise may be encountered in both [[Occupational noise|occupational]] and recreational settings. HPDs are recommended for use in settings where it is difficult to control the noise level, and the person exposed to the noise cannot be removed from the environment. 

The amount of protection from noise can vary based on the physical fit of the device. Hearing protection devices with accurate placement (an airtight seal) and/or accurate insertion (deep into the ear canal) will provide the most attenuation of noise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In occupational settings in the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) regulations dictate whether employees are required to wear hearing protection devices or participate in a [[hearing conservation program]]. 

== Noise reduction ratings ==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2018}}
Hearing protection device manufacturers are required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to label HPDs with a Noise Reduction Rating, or NRR. The NRR indicates the effectiveness of the HPD to reduce the level of noise, measured in [[decibel]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The higher the NRR, the greater the reduction of noise. 

The NRR is measured by manufacturers using [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) specified procedures in a laboratory environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The NRR tends to overestimate the amount of protection the HPDs provide in real-world conditions. These differences are most likely attributed to inaccurate insertion depth of earplugs. Because the actual amount of attenuation is typically less than the labeled NRR, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]]/OSHA suggest "derating" or reducing the NRR when using it to evaluate how much noise attenuation the user can expect from the HPD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] proposed new procedures for measuring the NRR for hearing protection devices in 2009, which would yield NRRs closer to those obtained in real-world conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, these proposed changes have yet to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since NRRs can overestimate the attenuation of the HPD, procedures have been developed in order to determine the actual attenuation of the device as it is worn. These tests for checking attenuation values summarize the real-world attenuation in a [[personal attenuation rating (PAR)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The PAR is unique to the HPD tested and the individual wearing the protection. When obtaining a PAR, it is recommended to test both ears individually as there may be asymmetry between ears. This asymmetry can be caused by anatomical differences between ears or improper fit of the HPD and could lead to a unilateral threshold shift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A PAR can be reported as C-weighted values, [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] values, or attenuation values for specific frequencies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William|date=Winter 2013|title=Comparing Personal Attenuation Ratings for Hearing Protector Fit-test systems|url=http://www.caohc.org/updatearticles/winter2013.pdf?version=012914|journal=CAOHC Update|volume=25|pages=6-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAR can then be used to determine if the HPD is providing adequate attenuation so that an individual's noise exposure does not exceed the recommended limits set forth by regulatory agencies such as the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Regulations and standards ==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2018}}
===United States===
* [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (1983; 29 CFR 1910.95)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9735|title=1910.95(a)|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Labor|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires the use of HPDs in occupational settings when the noise exposure levels are equal to or above an 8-hour [[Time-weighted average (PEL)|time-weighted average]] of 90 [[A-weighting|dB-A]].

'''Hypoplastic right heart syndrome''' is a [[Congenital heart disease|congenital heart defect]] in which the [[right atrium]] and [[right ventricle]] are underdeveloped. This defect causes inadequate blood flow to the lungs and thus, a blue or cyanotic infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypoplastic right heart syndrome|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2922/hypoplastic-right-heart-syndrome|website=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Common symptoms include a grayish-blue (cyanosis) coloration to the skin, lips, fingernails and other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="chd-uk.co.uk"/&gt; Other pronounced symptoms can be rapid/difficulty breathing, poor feeding, cold hands or feet, or being inactive and drowsy. "In a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, if the natural connections between the heart's left and right sides (foramen oval and ductus arteriosus) are allowed to close, he or she may go into shock." Signs of shock can include cool or clammy skin, a weak or rapid pulse, and dilated pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/basics/symptoms/con-20031294?reDate=25042015, 1998-2015.

The Notch-signaling pathway is involved in multiple processes during heart development, along with Wnt signaling.[6] Cardiomyocyte differentiation, patterning of the different cardiac regions, valve development, ventricular trabeculation, and outflow tract development have all been shown to depend on the activity of specific Notch-signaling elements.[6] The importance of Notch signaling in human disease is evident from the discovery that many mutations in components of this pathway are inherited in several genetic and acquired disorders, though one cannot acquire hypoplastic right heart syndrome.[6] Some of the mutations are thought to be on chromosome 2.[9] Other deletions are thought to be chromosomal arms 9q34 and 20p12, which contain NOTCH1 and JAG1 and deletion of band q22 or q24.[6] Wnt signaling also plays a role along with Notch 1,2 and JAG in the formation of cardiac tissues and heart development.[2]  When there are mutations in the Notch and Wnt pathways, Notch and Wnt are either not signaled or inhibited.[2] These pathways have to signal proteins and other pathways, like Tbx2, 3 and 20, Bmp2, 10, and Hey1 and 2 which play a major role in different parts of the heart developing. When these proteins and other pathways aren’t signaled or are inhibited abnormalities form[6]

==Pathogenesis==
When the right side of the heart is more underdeveloped than the left side, this is known as hypoplastic right heart syndrome. HRHS is known for the pulmonary atresia valves, the tricuspid valve, and the hypoplastic pulmonary artery fail to form properly. HRHS also causes the right ventricle to be a fair amount smaller than the left side.&lt;ref name="chd-uk.co.uk"&gt;CHD-UK, Hypoplastic Right heart Syndrome (HRHS), http://www.chd-uk.co.uk/types-of-chd-and-operations/hypoplastic-right-heart-syndrome-hrhs/, 2007-2015. Web. 25 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In people with hypoplastic right heart syndrome, the heart is not able to adequately pump blood to the lungs. The result of this is an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood to be circulated to the body. The severity of underdevelopment varies for each individual. A special team of pediatric cardiologists is required to develop a treatment plan.
===Anatomy===
A healthy heart has four [[Heart valve|valves]], separated by flaps that open and close to control blood flow between the chambers. When the heart beats, oxygen-poor blood enters the [[right atrium]]. The blood then flows into the [[right ventricle]], where it enters the [[pulmonary artery]] to travel to the lungs for oxygen. Oxygen-rich blood returns to the [[left atrium]], where it then travels into the [[left ventricle]]. The left ventricle pushes the oxygenated blood into the [[aorta]] to be circulated to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hhw/contraction.html Heart Contraction and Blood Flow]. [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart is a mesoderm-derived organ; Mesoderm is the middle germ layer of an embryo, whose formation is regulated by various genes. Initially, the most important is expression of Nkx2.5, CR1, pitx2, anf and mhc2a, is responsible for differentiation of the types of cardiomyocytes to determine which part of the heart they go to.[5] In a later in differentiation, activation of  hand1, hand2 and other genes was revealed to help in development. [5] Expression of these genes expression is regulated by various processes, including transcription and growth factors, as well as proteins like fibrillin, Wnt,  BMP2, BMP 4, BMP5, BMP7,  which aid in different heart development features like the valves and septum, and other substances, such as retinoid and folic acid.[5] 
Crucial steps in heart formation are development of the ventricles and atrium formation, as well as septation and valve formation. Any disturbances of such processes may lead to various congenital heart diseases and defects that could be initiated by various genetic, epigenetic or environmental factors. The most common heart malformations from genetic or epigenetic problems are: stenosis of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, which is a narrowing of the vessels, atrial and/or ventricular septal defect, tricuspid atresia, hypoplastic left and right heart.  When you have hypoplastic right or left heart more than one of these problems occur together [5]


==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}

==Treatment==
There is no cure for hypoplastic right heart syndrome. A three-stage surgical procedure is commonly used to treat the condition. The surgeries rearrange the blood flow within the heart and allow the left ventricles to do the work for the underdeveloped right side of the heart. The three surgeries are spread out over the patients first few years of life. The first procedure, usually either the [[Norwood procedure]] or [[BT shunt]], is typically done within the first few days or weeks of life. The second procedure, called the [[Glenn procedure]], is usually performed between four and twelve months of age. The last surgery, known as the [[Fontan procedure]], is typically performed around the age of 18 months and older. These surgeries change the blood flow to the lungs so that there is always oxygenated blood.  
In a stage 1 Norwood procedure for hypoplastic right heart, the main pulmonary artery is separated from the left and right portions of the pulmonary artery and joined with the upper portion of the aorta.[7] The proximal pulmonary artery is  connected to the aortic arch, while the narrowed segment of the pulmonary trunk is repaired. An aortopulmonary shunt is created to connect the aorta to the main pulmonary artery to provide pulmonary blood flow to the lungs.[7]  The Glen procedure disconnects the superior vena cava from the heart and connects it to the right pulmonary artery so deoxygenated blood from the upper body goes directly to the lungs.[10] The Fontan procedure, done usually after the patient is two years old, disconnects the inferior vena cava from the heart and connects it directly with the other pulmonary artery so that deoxygenated blood from the lower body then is sent directly to the lungs.[1]

==Follow-up care==
With a series of operations or even a heart transplant, a newborn can be treated but not be cured. Young individuals who have undergone reconstructive surgery must refer to a cardiologist who is experienced in congenital heart diseases,&lt;ref name="chop.edu"&gt;Reviewed by David J. Goldberg, MD, About Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-hlhs/about#.VSppX7PnF_sY, 2013-2015. Web. 12 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "Children with HLHS are at an increased level for developing endocarditis." Kids that have been diagnosed with HRHS must limit the physical activity they participate in to their own endurance level.&lt;ref&gt;American Heart Association, Single Ventricle Defects, http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/CongenitalHeartDefaects/AboutCongenitalHeartDefects/Single-Ventricle-Defects_UCM_307037_Article.jsp, 2015. Web. 12 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prevalence==
Hypoplastic right heart syndrome is more common than [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] with in the United States alone it occurs in 1 in 2,500 births as opposed to the latter that occurs in 1 in 4,300 births.&lt;ref name="pmid15164412"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paulick J, Tennstedt C, Schwabe M, Körner H, Bommer C, Chaoui R |title=Prenatal diagnosis of an isochromosome 5p in a fetus with increased nuchal translucency thickness and pulmonary atresia with hypoplastic right heart at 14 weeks |journal=Prenat.

This rare anomaly requires prenatal diagnosis since it needs immediate and emergency treatment. Pregnant women whose pregnancy is complicated with this anomaly should be referred to a level 3 hospital with pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiothoracic surgical team.[3]

It can be associated with [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9476678"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma J, Friedman D, Schiller M, Flynn P, Alonso ML |title=Aortic stenosis in hypoplastic right heart syndrome, associated with interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 |journal=Int.

{{nihongo|'''Isshin-ji'''|一心寺}} is a [[Jōdo-shū|Pure Land]] [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] in [[Osaka]], Japan. Starting in the [[Meiji period]], thirteen [[Japanese sculpture|images]] have been formed, each incorporating the ashes of tens of thousands of devotees. The annual burial ceremony on 21 April in turn draws tens of thousands of worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/tennoji/page/0000000235.html |script-title=ja:一心寺の定例納骨法要 |trans-title=The regular burial ceremony at Isshinji |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Osaka|Osaka City]] |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918015727/http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/tennoji/page/0000000235.html |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Isshin-ji is said to have been founded in 1185 by [[Hōnen]]. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] camped at the compound in 1614/15 during the [[Siege of Osaka|Siege]] of [[Osaka Castle]] and became a patron of the temple after his victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isshinji.or.jp/profile_history.html |script-title=ja:一心寺　歴史 |trans-title=Isshinji – History |language=Japanese |publisher=Isshinji |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kobori Masakazu|Kobori Enshū]] designed the temple's tea room or ''[[chashitsu]]'' in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/kensetsu/page/0000009757.html |script-title=ja:一心寺 (いっしんじ) |trans-title=Isshinji |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Osaka|Osaka City]] |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular [[Kabuki]] actor [[Ichikawa Danjūrō VIII]] was buried in the grounds in 1854 and from that time large numbers of [[Japanese funeral#Cremation|urns]] were deposited there. By the mid-1880s there were over fifty thousand and, in part due to limitations of space, in 1887 the head priest commissioned sculptors skilled in [[casting]] to create a statue of [[Amida Nyorai|Amida]], combining the ashes with [[resin]]. Bombing during the [[Pacific War]] destroyed the temple and the six statues completed by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Power in Japanese Buddhist Art, 1600–2005 |author=Graham, Patricia J |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8248-3126-4 |pages=192–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nōkotsudō was the first structure to be rebuilt, in 1957, in order to house the images; this was followed by the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Hondō]] in 1966, Guest Centre (Nissōden) in 1977, and the [[Nenbutsu]] [[Dō (architecture)|dō]] in 1992. The [[Mon (architecture)|main gate]], with two bronze guardian statues ([[Nio|Kongōrikishi]]), was added in 1997, and was constructed with steel, reinforced concrete, and glass. The Sanzen Butsudō of 2002, designed to resemble a church, features a large mural of [[Amida Nyorai|Amida]], [[Kannon]], and [[Seishi]] [[Raigō|appearing]] to welcome the dying. It is claimed that this painting is the largest [[tempera]] mural in the world.&lt;ref name="Faith"/&gt; The hall is used for services, [[Marriage in Japan|weddings]], and as a theatre for the local experimental troupe.&lt;ref name="Faith"&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Power in Japanese Buddhist Art, 1600–2005 |author=Graham, Patricia J |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8248-3126-4 |pages=238–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isshinji.or.jp/faq.html |script-title=ja:ようこそうお参りくださいました |trans-title=Isshinji – FAQ |publisher=Isshinji |language=Japanese |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of {{nihongo|''okotsu butsu''|お骨佛}} (''lit.'' 'bone Buddhas') may be traced to a four-metre [[polychrome]] statue of [[Jizo#In Japan|Jizō]] dating to 1700, formed by the priest Shingan (1647–1706) from crushed bones mixed with clay and dedicated at the temple of Daien-ji in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], where it still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Power in Japanese Buddhist Art, 1600–2005 |author=Graham, Patricia J |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8248-3126-4 |pages=98f}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|Hōnen-ji|[[:ja:法然寺|法然寺]]}} in [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]] and {{nihongo|Shōjōkei'in|[[:ja:清浄華院|清浄華院]]}} in [[Kyoto]] have since followed Isshin-ji's example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Power in Japanese Buddhist Art, 1600–2005 |author=Graham, Patricia J |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8248-3126-4 |pages=195, 299}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first six sculptures were lost in the war, a further seven have since been formed with collection underway for the fourteenth; all are of Amida:&lt;ref name="Okotsu"/&gt;

[[St. Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava|St. Martin's Cathedral]] is known especially for previously being the [[#Coronations|coronation church]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and since it was built over an old [[cemetery]], it contains [[catacombs]] of unknown length and several [[crypt]]s containing the [[sepulchre]]s of many significant historical figures, up to six meters beneath the church.

Over the centuries, the cathedral's [[sepulchre]]s filled with many significant figures, such as ecclesiastic dignitaries, presidents of the historic [[Pozsony county]] as well as [[Jozef Ignác Bajza|J. I. Bajza]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bratislava-info.net/atrakcie_info.php?id=003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slovakia.culturalprofiles.net/?id=5890&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the first Slovak [[novel]], but also with dozens of bishops, cannons, French priests fleeing the [[French revolution]] and many people outside the Catholic church.

The '''Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health''' (LRCBH), officially the '''Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health''', opened on May 21, 2010 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] that is operated by the [[Cleveland Clinic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/cleveland_clinic_to_manage_lou.html Cleveland Clinic to manage Lou Ruvo Brain Institute in Las Vegas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219151134/http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/cleveland_clinic_to_manage_lou.html |date=2009-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed by the [[starchitect|world-renowned architect]] [[Frank Gehry]].

==History==
Keep Memory Alive (also known as KMA) was founded by [[Larry Ruvo]], senior managing partner of Southern Wines and Spirits, in memory of his father, Lou Ruvo, a victim of Alzheimer's Disease, together with his wife Camille, [[MGM Mirage|Mirage Resorts]] CEO [[Bobby Baldwin]] (who also lost his father to Alzheimer's Disease), and Bobby Baldwin's wife Donna.  KMA supports the mission of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and has held several star-studded galas, attended by celebrities and notables from around the world. It has become one of Las Vegas' most important [[Charitable organization|charity]] initiatives and a key participant in the nation fight against [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Since its inception, the event has raised more than $20 million towards achieving its goal – the realization of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.  Funds committed by such supporters as the Spector Family Foundation, the Roland and Terri Sturm Foundation, Steinberg Diagnostics, the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] and [[America Online]] will be utilized for the construction and operation of this state-of-the-art facility.  The Center is planned to become a national resource for the most current research and scientific information for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's|Huntington 's Diseases]], Multiple Sclerosis and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)]] as well as focusing on prevention, early detection and education.

==Design==
The ceremonial groundbreaking of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health occurred on February 9, 2007. Dignitaries who attended the groundbreaking ceremonies for the $70 million project included founder Larry Ruvo, [[Frank Gehry]], [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]] and [[John Ensign]]; [[U.S. Representative]] [[Shelley Berkley]], [[Jon Porter]] and [[Dean Heller]], Gov. [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]], Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]], former Gov. [[Kenny Guinn]], Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[John Cusack]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsilometes, John [http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/do/2007/jan/14/566689985.html John Katsilometes on the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute's groundbreaking, Las Vegas Sun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121040443/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/do/2007/jan/14/566689985.html |date=2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegaspopular.com/2007/02/09/kevin-spacey-teri-hatcher-and-other-celebs-gather-in-vegas-to-raise-10-million/ Kevin Spacey, Teri Hatcher and Other Celebs Gather in Vegas to Raise $10-Million for Lou Ruvo Brain Institute] Vegas Popular, February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center operates as an outpatient treatment and research facility in downtown Las Vegas on land deeded to Keep Memory Alive, the fund raising arm of LRCBH, by the City of Las Vegas as part of its {{convert|61|acre|abbr=on}} [[Symphony Park]].  The Center is approximately {{convert|65000|sqft|abbr=on}} and includes 13 examination rooms, offices for health care practitioners and researchers, a "Museum of the Mind," and a community auditorium. The Center will also serve as the headquarters for Keep Memory Alive, the Las Vegas Alzheimer's Association and the Las Vegas Parkinson's Disease Association.

The '''Lowermoor Water Treatment Works''' supplies [[drinking water]] to the north [[Cornwall]] water distribution network. Raw water is obtained from the [[Crowdy Reservoir]], which is 3/4 mile to the north east, and which is filled predominantly by run-off and drainage from surrounding moorland. The works were constructed in 1973.&lt;ref name="subgroupreport"&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Closedconsultations/DH_4112044 Subgroup report on the Lowermoor water pollution incident. Department of Health 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Camelford water pollution incident]], water treatment was being carried out by [[South West Water]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">The '''Mental Health Act 2001''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the Irish Parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], which sets out the legal procedures for admissions and treatment in approved centres. It aims to protect the rights of everyone using the [[mental health]] services. It aims to ensure the patient's best interest is the most important aspect of mental health. The Act says that the patient has the right to receive good quality mental health care, and mental health services should be properly run and regulated. Under the act, mental health workers are obliged  to ensure the patient is treated in a way that respects their rights. The Mental Health Act 2001 was enacted by the [[Oireachtas]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on 8 July 2001.  Most of the important provisions came into force on 1 November 2006.  Some less important sections came into force in 2002.

The Act provides for the involuntary civil admission of patients on grounds of mental disorder.  It also establishes the Mental Health Commission and the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services.  It establishes three-person [[Mental Health Tribunal]]s which review the detention of patients on a regular basis.A patient has the right to attend their own tribunal. It also outlines the voluntary admission policy. Patients can leave the hospital at any time if they are under voluntary status. If staff feel that they may be a harm to themselves or to others they can hold them for up to 24 hours, and they will be reviewed by two consultant [[psychiatrists]].&lt;ref&gt;Mental Health Commission (homepage)(online) available from: http://www.mhcirl.ie/ [accessed 17/12/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institute of Virology, Pune''' is an [[India]]n [[virology]] [[research institute]], and one of the [[Translational science]] cells part of  [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR).&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/insprofile/Compilation-Inst-centre-units.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously known as 'Virus Research Center' and was founded in collaboration with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. It has been designated as a WHO H5 reference Laboratory for SE Asia region &lt;ref&gt;[http://icmr.nic.in/pinstitute/niv.htm National Institute of Virology, Pune] [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virus Research Center (VRC), Pune came into existence in 1952 under the joint auspices of the ICMR and the Rockefeller Foundation, as a part of the global programme of investigations on the arthropod-borne group of viruses. In view of its expanded scope and activities, the VRC was redesignated as the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in 1978.

The NIV is identified today as the [[WHO Collaborating Centres|WHO Collaborating Center]] for arboviruses reference and hemorrhagic fever reference and research. NIV is also the National Monitoring Center for Influenza, Japanese encephalitis, Rota, Measles and Hepatitis.

==History==
The National Institute of Virology is one of the major Institutes of the [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR). It was established at Pune, Maharashtra State in 1952 as Virus Research Centre (VRC) under the auspices of the ICMR and the Rockefeller Foundation (RF), USA. It was an outcome of the global programme of the RF for investigating the Arthropod Borne viruses. Since the studies on arboviruses and their arthropod vectors involve most of the basic principles and techniques of general virology, entomology and zoology, these viruses were also considered to be an ideal group, to begin with, for intensive training and research in virology. The RF withdrew its support in 1967 and since then the institute has been funded by the ICMR.

The institute was designated as one of the collaborating laboratories of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1967 and it started functioning as the regional centre of the WHO for South-East Asia for arbovirus studies from 1969. Since 1974, it has been functioning as a WHO collaborating centre for arbovirus reference and research. In 1995 it has been redesignated as the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research and Rapid Diagnosis of Viral Diseases. NIV is also the National Centre for Hepatitis and Influenza. The field unit of NIV at Bangalore is one of the centers under National Polio Surveillance Program conducting surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis cases from Karnataka as a part of Global Polio Eradication Programme of the WHO South-East Asia region since 1997.

The institute conducts an M.Sc. in Virology and a PhD course, under the aegis of the [[University of Pune]].

==Achievements==
Research areas include Cell repository, Electron microscopy, Rickettsioses, Hepatitis, Influenza and related viruses, Clinical virology, Biochemistry, Virus registry, and Biostatistics. The research activities of the Institute are coordinated by a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) consisting of eminent scientists.

On the recommendation of the SAC, the VRC acquired its status of national importance and was renamed as the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in 1978. Subsequently, studies on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Rotavirus gastroenteritis, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, Rabies, Herpes sirnplex, Buffalo pox, Measles, and Poliomyelitis were also initiated.

A Microbial Containment Complex (MCC) having P-3 biosafety levels for handling microorganisms of highly infectious nature is being established at Pashan, 11&amp;nbsp;km off the main laboratory at Pune. The laboratory will provide a National Containment facility for the safe handling of hazardous pathogens.

'''Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test''' (PASAT) is a [[neuropsychological test]] used to assess capacity and rate of information processing and sustained  and divided attention.&lt;ref&gt;Spreen O., Strauss E.: A Compendium of Neuropsychological Tests; ²1998; New York, Oxford University press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally the test was known as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT). The subjects are given in the version used as part of the  [[Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite]] a number every 3 seconds and are asked to add the number they just heard with the number they heard before. This is a challenging task that involves [[working memory]], attention and arithmetic capabilities. Versions with numbers presented every 2 seconds are also available. The original version presented the numbers every 2.4 seconds with 0.4 decrements for subsequent trials. The PASAT was originally developed for use in evaluating patients with [[head injury]].&lt;ref&gt;Gronwall DM. Paced auditory serial-addition task: a measure of recovery from concussion. Percept Mot Skills. 1977 Apr;44(2):367–373&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage in this population was supposed to be minimal practice effects. This test has been widely used in other conditions besides [[traumatic brain injury]].

==Multiple sclerosis==
It has become widely used in the testing of patients with [[multiple sclerosis]] as patients with this disease frequently have an impaired performance on this test. The PASAT was included in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite &lt;ref&gt;Fischer S. et al. (2001) Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, New York; The National Multiple Sclerosis Society http://pasat.us/PDF/MSFC_Manual.pdf seen Oct 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as a cognitive measure. However, the use of the PASAT in [[clinical trial]]s in MS it has shown to be problematic as there are significant practice effects over repeated measures; typically the effect of treatment is reflected by a larger improvement on the test compared to the [[Experimental control|control group]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6987">'''Patricia Katherine Kuhl''' is a [[Professor]] of [[Speech and language pathology|Speech and Hearing Sciences]] and co-director of the Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences at the [[University of Washington]].  She specializes in [[language acquisition]] and the neural bases of [[language]], and she has also conducted research on [[language development]] in [[autism]] and [[speech recognition|computer speech recognition]]. Kuhl currently serves as an associate editor for the [[academic journal|journals]] ''[[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]]'', ''[[Neuroscience]]'', and ''[[Developmental Science]]''.

==Biography==
Kuhl received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[speech science]] from [[St. Cloud State University]] in 1967, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in speech science from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1971, and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] in speech science and [[psychology]] in 1973.  She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[Central Institute for the Deaf]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1976.  Since 1977, she has been employed as a professor of [[Speech and language pathology|Speech and Hearing Sciences]] at the [[University of Washington]], with adjunct appointments in the departments of [[Linguistics]], [[Psychology]], [[Otolaryngology]], [[Neuroscience]], and [[Education]].  She serves as a co-director of the UW Institute for Brain and Learning Sciences, an interdisciplinary scientific research center on human [[learning]], with her husband, [[Andrew Meltzoff]].

==Research==
Kuhl is internationally recognized for her research on early [[language acquisition|language]] and [[neural development|brain development]], and studies that show how young [[children]] [[learn]]. Kuhl’s work has played a major role in demonstrating how early exposure to language [[synaptic plasticity|alters the brain]]. It has implications for [[critical period hypothesis|critical periods]] in [[child development|development]], for [[bilingual education]] and [[reading readiness]], for [[developmental disabilities]] involving language, and for research on [[speech recognition|computer understanding of speech]].

===Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory===
Kuhl has proposed the [[Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory]] to account for the developmental change by which infants' ability to [[phonological awareness|discriminate]] [[phonemes|speech sounds]] becomes increasingly specific to their [[native language]] as they age. The model shows that infants use their computational abilities to "crack" the [[speech|speech code]] and that infants' [[social skills]] play an important role in learning.

===Recognition===
Kuhl was one of six scientists invited to the White House in 1997 to make a presentation at [[Bill Clinton|President]] and [[Hillary Clinton|Mrs. Clinton's]] Conference on Early Learning and the Brain. In 2001, she was invited to make a presentation at [[George W. Bush|President]] and [[Laura Bush|Mrs. Bush’s]] White House Summit on Early [[cognitive development|Cognitive Development]]: Ready to Read, Ready to Learn.

Kuhl's work has been widely covered by the [[Media (communication)|media]]. She has appeared in the [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]] television series "The Baby Human"; the [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]] series "The Mind"; "The Power of Ideas" on [[PBS]]; and "The Secret Life of the Brain," also on PBS. She has discussed her research findings on early learning and the brain on [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], [[Good Morning America]], [[CBS Evening News]], [[NBC Nightly News]], NHK, [[CNN]], and in [[The New York Times]], [[Time Magazine|Time]], [[TED (conference)]], and [[Newsweek]].

Kuhl is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Rodin Academy]], and the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].  She has also been elected a fellow in the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[Cognitive Science Society]], and the [[Association for Psychological Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows|url=http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/fellows/|website=Cognitive Science Society|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhl was awarded the [[ASA Silver Medal|Silver Medal]] of the [[Acoustical Society of America]] in 1997, the [[Kenneth Craik Research Award]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 2005, and the Gold Medal from the acoustics branch of the [[American Institute of Physics]] in 2008. She received the [[University of Washington]]'s Faculty Lectureship Award in 1998, and she was awarded the [[University of Minnesota]]’s Outstanding Achievement Award in 2007.

In 2018 she received the [[APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Psychology]] from the [[American Psychological Association]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/about/awards/scientific-contributions.aspx?tab=3|title=APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions|publisher= APA|accessdate= 2 December 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{ WAP assignment | course = Wikipedia:Australia Education Program/Courses/Health Informatics C – Electronic Health Records (Dennis Wollersheim) | university = La Trobe University | term = 2013 Q1 | project = }}
The '''Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record''' ('''PCEHR''') is a shared electronic health summary set up by the Australian government with implementation overseen by the [[National Electronic Health Transition Authority]] (NEHTA). The purpose of the PCEHR is to provide a secure electronic summary of people's medical history&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title=e-Health Part 1: current state of play.|journal=Australian Nursing Journal|date=1/8/12|year=2012|volume=20|issue=2|page=20|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=742e0050-6d55-4716-b2d7-cd911bb9f733%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=6|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will eventually include information such as current [[medications]], [[adverse drug reaction]]s, [[allergies]] and [[immunisation]] history in an easily accessible format. This PCEHR is stored in a network of connected systems with the ability to improve the sharing of information amongst [[health care providers]] to improve patient outcomes no matter where in Australia a patient presents for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spriggs|first=Merele|author2=et. al|title=Ethical Questions Must be Considered for Electronic Health Records|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|year=2012|volume=38|issue=9|pages=535–539|doi=10.1136/medethics-2011-100413|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/38/9/535.abstract|pmid=22573881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a PCEHR?|url=http://www.nehta.gov.au/ehealth-implementation/what-is-a-pcehr|publisher=NEHTA|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently an [[opt-in]] system with a unique '''individual healthcare identifier''' ('''IHI''') being assigned to participants and the option of masking and limiting information available for viewing controlled by the patient or a nominated representative.

== Rationale ==

Currently it is reported that on average, each Australian has 22 health system interactions annually, be that [[General practitioner]] (GP) visits, specialists, or prescriptions. All of these interactions are held in individual, separate, paper-based records making the entire health picture of an individual difficult to ascertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PCEHR|url=http://www.swsml.com.au/site/pcehr|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported that up to 10% of hospital admissions are due to adverse drug events, 18% are due to medical errors relating to lack of adequate available patient information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's Health|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442453139|publisher=AIHW|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 25% of clinicians time is spent collecting information regarding the patient than actually treating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For your Information|publisher=Australian Audit Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facts combined with the ageing Australian population, vast geographic expanse, and ever increasing population, have necessitated the implementation of the PCEHR in an effort to bring the medical record into the 21st century.

== Implementation ==

As part of the 2010/11 Australian federal budget the Hon. [[Nicola Roxon]] (Minister for Health and Aging) announced the PCEHR as a "key building block of the National Health and Hospitals Network".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records for All Australians|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/budget/publishing.nsf/Content/budget2010-hmedia09.htm|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system went live on 1 July 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personally controlled electronic health records|url=http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/content/pcehr#.UZCuocpvd1B|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
The system is based on the XDS (Cross Enterprise Document Sharing) Profile published by [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise]] (IHE). However, the usual IHE Patient Management system (PIX/PDQ) has been replaced by the National Health Identity (HI) Service. In addition the usual authentication and security IHE profiles have been replaced by, or significantly modified to work with, existing infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===== National Authentication Service for Health Public Key Infrastructure (NASH PKI) =====

National Authentication Service for Health [[Public Key Infrastructure]] is a certificate that authenticates healthcare professionals accessing the eHealth records system. These certificates can be loaded onto smart cards which are then used in combination with the healthcare professionals HPI-I to log on to patients who have a PCEHR using the patients IHI. This system also facilitates secure electronic communications with other healthcare provider organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASH|url=http://www.nehta.gov.au/our-work/nash|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PKI allows users to know:
*who sent the message
*the message hasn't been altered between sending and receiving it.
*the sender can't dispute the message they created and sent 
*that only the person the message is directed to can open it&lt;ref name=medicareaustraliaPKI&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Key Infrastructure|url=http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/vendors/pki/index.jsp|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits allow users to securely and confidently relay patient information to trustworthy sources.

For the PKI to work there must be a '''Chain of Trust''' on your computer. This Chain of Trust is composed of three certificates, namely:
# Medicare Australia Root CA
# Medicare Australia Organisation CA
# Medicare Australia Organisation CA2&lt;ref name=medicareaustraliaPKI/&gt;

The PKI Certificates are based on the Australian Gatekeeper framework and met the [[International Organisation for Standardization]] (ISO) Health Informatics-Public Key Infrastructure technical specification (ISO/TS 17090).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Key Infrastructure|url=http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/vendors/pki/index.jsp|publisher=Medicare|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costs ====

It was budgeted to cost $466.7m but had surpassed this to $766m before the actual launch date with the final figure still to be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Stephen|title=Political capital: The electronic health record challenge|journal=The Australian Journal of Pharmacy|date=April 2012|volume=93|issue=1103|pages=18–19|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/166493149?l-decade=52&amp;q&amp;c=article&amp;versionId=181449905|accessdate=13 May 2013|issn=0311-8002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast a recent study published by Deloitte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Budget 2012–13: Health initiatives &amp; expenditure Aged care support, NDIS, dental, Health and Hospital Fund (HHF) projects, PCEHR and PHIAC|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_AU/au/insights/browse-by-job-title/coos/326ec186ecfb7310VgnVCM1000001956f00aRCRD.htm|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; projected the PCEHR to save approximately $11.5&amp;nbsp;billion over the 2010 to 2025 period. This consists of approximately $9.5&amp;nbsp;billion in net direct benefits to the Australian Government and $2.0&amp;nbsp;billion in net direct benefits to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expected benefits of the national PCEHR system|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/pcehr-benefits#.UYta3spvd1B|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Take-up ====

{{As of|2013|02|17|post=,}} 1233 healthcare organisations had registered for the PCEHR with NEHTA CEO Peter Fleming estimating 98% of GP-specific software was PCEHR compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Kate|title=Half a million PCEHR registrations still achievable: DoHA|url=http://www.pulseitmagazine.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1317:half-a-million-pcehr-registrations-still-achievable-doha&amp;catid=16:australian-ehealth&amp;Itemid=328|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=Pulse+IT|date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 7-month mark 56,761 patients had registered with the 12-month target at 500,000 patients. This target figure was still considered achievable according to the DoHA deputy secretary Rosemary Huxtable who had released this information to a Senate Estimates committee.

On 16 August 2012 the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, the then Minister for Health announced the ''Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012 (PCEHR)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00063|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was amended in late 2015 to be known as the ''My Health Records Act 2012'' (Cth)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2012A00063|title=My Health Records Act 2012 (Cth)|last=|first=|date=6 March 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients can read in full everything that is added to their eHealth record. They may choose to include additional information in their own local clinical information system that is not included in the eHealth record. In any event, patients have a right under the [[Privacy Act 1988]] (Cth) to access the personal information that healthcare professionals hold about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehealth.gov.au/internet/ehealth/publishing.nsf/Content/faqs-hcp-managing|title=Managing a patient's eHealth record|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2015 the ''My Health Records Act 2012'' (Cth) was amended to reflect that  representatives  of  persons  who  require  decision-making  support related to the Act must support   the   person   to   make   decisions,  or   make   decisions   on   their   behalf, reflecting the individual's "will and preferences". This reflects the principle that people with disability or varied capacity have an equal right to have their decisions respected. &lt;ref&gt;This followed Recommendation 4-8 of the [https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/equality-capacity-disability-report-124 Australian Law Reform Commission, ''Equality, Capacity and Disability in Commonwealth Laws'', Report No 124 (2014)].

==== PCEHR Jurisdictional Advisory Committee (PCEHR JAC) ====

The PCEHR Act established the PCEHR Jurisdictional Advisory Committee (PCEHR JAC) to advise the System Operator on matters relating to the interests of the Commonwealth, States and Territories in the PCEHR system. The PCEHR JAC meets at least four times per year, or more frequently as agreed between the System Operator and the Chair.
The PCEHR JAC has nine members, a member to represent the Commonwealth and a member to represent each State and Territory.&lt;ref name=yourhealthGovernance&gt;{{cite web|title=PCEHR Governance|url=http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/pcehr-governance#.UaFQlJy1tOQ|accessdate=26 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513091436/http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/pcehr-governance#.UaFQlJy1tOQ|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== PCEHR Independent Advisory Council (PCEHR IAC) ====

The PCEHR Independent Advisory Council (PCEHR IAC) was established under the PCEHR Act to advise on the operation and participation in the PCEHR system, clinical, privacy and security matters relating to PCEHR system operations. The PCEHR IAC meets at least four times per year.&lt;ref name=yourhealthGovernance/&gt;

== Registration ==

'''Patients''' are able to opt into the PCEHR by providing personal details such as full name, date of birth, Medicare/Department of Veteran Affairs number, and sex.
Currently there are several mediums for consumers to register via:
* Online&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* By Telephone
* In writing
* In person (by visiting a [[Department of Human Services (Australia)|Department of Human Services]] centre offering [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] services)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General consumer FAQs|url=http://www.ehealth.gov.au/internet/ehealth/publishing.nsf/Content/faqs-consumer-gen#anchor18|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity Verification Code (IVC) ===

If a consumer registers over the phone, in writing, or in person an identity verification code IVC is issued to enable access to the e-Health record online for the first time. After this first log, or post 30 days from issuance the IVC becomes obsolete.   
There are four steps in the registration process:
# Read the essential information
# Create a new or log into your australia.gov.au account
# Verify your identity
# Set up your e-Health record &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prepare to register|url=http://www.ehealth.gov.au/internet/ehealth/publishing.nsf/content/before_you_register|publisher=Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare Identifiers Service (HI Service) ===

The Healthcare Identifiers Service (HI Service) was established by the federal, state and territory governments to create unique identifiers for healthcare providers and individuals seeking healthcare. It was designed and implemented by Medicare Australia under the control of the NEHTA.
The HI Service allocates three types of Healthcare Identifiers:&lt;ref name=AboutHIService&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Healthcare Identifiers Service|url=http://ehealthinfo.gov.au/healthcare-identifiers/56-healthcare-identifiers-an-important-first-in-ehealth|publisher=eHealth|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-date=27 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427142302/http://ehealthinfo.gov.au/healthcare-identifiers/56-healthcare-identifiers-an-important-first-in-ehealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Identifiers for Healthcare Professional|url=http://www.ehealthinfo.gov.au/assets/Healthcare%20Identifiers%20for%20Healthcare%20Professionals.pdf|publisher=eHealth|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-date=27 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427142401/http://www.ehealthinfo.gov.au/assets/Healthcare%20Identifiers%20for%20Healthcare%20Professionals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Individual healthcare identifier (i.e., who received the service)
: The Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) is a unique 16 digit reference number that is used to identify individuals within the healthcare system.
: The healthcare provider can retrieve a registered patients IHI via the Healthcare Identifier Service by entering in the correct name, DOB, and Medicare number which will automatically retrieve the patients unique IHI from the system. This then links the patients with their PCEHR, allowing the healthcare provider to view all the uploaded material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an individual healthcare identifier?|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/faq/health/965|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Health Provider Identifier-Individual (i.e., who provided the service)
: The Health Provider Identifier-Individual (HPI-I) is allocated to healthcare providers involved in providing patient care. Healthcare providers belonging to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) have automatically been registered for their HPI-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Identifiers|url=http://www.amsant.org.au/index.php/healthcare-identifiers|publisher=AMSANT|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique number allows healthcare providers to access patients PCEHR and also acts as a tracking tool of who has accessed what, what edits were made etc.
; Health Provider Identifier-Organisation (i.e., where the service was provided)
: The Health Provider Identifier-Organisation (HPI-O) is a unique code for organisations that provide healthcare services. An HPI-O may be linked to several HPI-I's, but an organisation can not have more than one HPI-O.&lt;ref name=AboutHIService/&gt;

== Incentives ==

=== eHealth Practice Incentives Program (ePIP) ===

The eHealth Practice Incentives Program (ePIP)aims to encourage GP's to adopt and embrace the latest technology and developments within the eHealth industry as they occur. 
GP's are only eligible for ePIP if they are already registered in the Practice Incentives Program (PIP) administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services (Human Services) on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing(DoHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Incentives Program (PIP)|url=http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/incentives/pip/index.jsp|publisher=Medicare|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five further requirements for this incentive:

The '''Prescriptive authority for psychologists (RxP) movement''' is a movement among certain psychologists to give [[medical prescription#Who can write prescriptions|prescriptive authority]] to [[psychologist]]s with 2 years of postdoctoral training, or Continuing Education training in clinical [[psychopharmacology]] and related sciences, followed by 1 – 2 years of supervised prescribing, or a Certificate from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] program, or the Board Certified Diploma from the Prescribing Psychologists Register (FICPP or FICPPM) to enable them, according to state law, to prescribe [[psychotropic]] medications to treat [[mental disorders|mental and emotional disorders]].  This approach is a non-traditional medical training focused on the specialized training to prescribe for mental health disorders by a psychologist. It includes rigorous didactics and supervised practicuums. Legislation pertaining to prescriptive authority for psychologists has been introduced over 180 times in over half of the United States.  It has passed in five states, due largely to substantial lobbying effort by the American Psychological Association.  Prior to RxP legislation and in states where it has not been passed, this role is played by [[psychiatrists]], who possess a medical degree and thus the authority to prescribe medication (whose numbers are at a critical shortage), and by primary care physicians who can prescribe psychotropics but lack extensive training in psychotropic drugs and in diagnosing and treating psychological disorders.  According to the [[American Psychological Association]], the professional organization of psychologists, the movement is a reaction to the growing public need for mental health services, particularly in under-resourced areas where patients have little or no access to psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Currently, in states where RxP legislation has been passed, psychologists who seek prescriptive authority must possess a doctoral level degree ([[PhD]]/[[PsyD]]) and a license to practice independently, with five years of clinical experience working with patients as a health care provider, and complete a [[post-doctoral]] Master of Science degree or any of the training programs from the Department of Defense, the Prescribing Psychologists' Register Diplomate Certification, or a post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology degree. A Preceptorship of one year of supervised work experience working directly with a licensed prescribing health professional for 100 patient supervision, makes the training a total of approximately 4 years.  The medications the psychologist may then prescribe are limited to those indicated for mental and emotional health problems.

Psychologists' involvement in [[pharmacotherapy]] exists on a continuum, with psychologists serving as prescribers, collaborators, and information providers in the medical decision-making process.  Currently, psychologists may prescribe in five states, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico and Louisiana, as well as in the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, the U.S. military and Guam. When psychologists act as collaborators, they lack the authority to make the final decision to prescribe; however, they may assist in the process by recommending clinically desirable treatment effects, certain classes of medications, specific medications, dosages, or other aspects of the treatment regimen.  Psychologists also provide information that may be relevant to the prescribing professional.  Psychologists may express concerns about treatment, refer patients for medication consults, direct patients to referral or information sources, or discuss with patients how to address their concerns about medication with the prescriber.&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association 2011"&gt;American Psychological Association (2011).  Practice guidelines regarding psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues.  ''[[American Psychologist]]'', 66(9), 835-849. doi: 10.1037/a0025890&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first bill seeking to authorize prescription privileges to psychologists was introduced in Hawaii in 1985 under Hawaii State Resolution 159. The bill allowed licensed psychologists in the state of Hawaii to administer and prescribe psychotropic medication for the treatment of nervous, mental, and organic brain disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Fox, R.E., DeLeon, P.H., Newman, R., Sammons, M.T., Dunivin, D.L., Backer, D.C.. (2009).  Prescriptive authority and psychology: A status report.  American Psychologist, 64(4), 257-268.&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 88 prescriptive authority bills have been introduced in 21 jurisdictions since then.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1988, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] approved a pilot project to train psychologists in issuing psychotropic medications "under certain circumstances". [[Guam]] became the first [[U.S. territory]] to approve RxP legislation in 1999. [[New Mexico]] became the first state to approve RxP legislation in 2002, and [[Louisiana]] followed in 2004. In 2014, Illinois became the third state to approve RxP legislation. In 2016 Iowa became the fourth state to grant prescriptive authority.  In 2017 Idaho became the fifth state to grant prescriptive authority.  Five other states have introduced RxP bills that are under discussion but have yet to be approved.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State of New Mexico]] was the first to enact a [[Psychologists prescribing law]], which is still in effect. [[Louisiana's legislature]] established medical psychology as a separate and distinct healthcare profession and transferred the regulation of their practice of medical psychology to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners.  At this time, the entire practice of psychology (for medical psychologist) including psychotherapy and psychological testing was also transferred to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, effectively making Louisiana the only state in the U.S. where, for some psychologists, a medical board has authority over the regulation of the entire practice of psychology.  Because of this, several national organizations, including the American Psychological Association and the [[Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards]] have expressed concern over a practice of psychology being regulated by another profession (i.e., medicine).  The Louisiana Psychological Association has strongly echoed such concerns. However, the Louisiana Academy of Medical Psychologists, a Political Action Committee representing medical psychologists in that state, strongly endorsed this change of regulation by another profession.

==APA Guidelines==
In December 2011, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) published a list of practice guidelines that apply to all prescribing activities, with some also applicable to collaborating and information providing activities.  The list is categorized according to the area of psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues (general, education, assessment, intervention and consultation).  The following list summarizes the guidelines by section.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;American Psychological Association (2011).  Practice guidelines regarding psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues.  American psychologist, 66(9), 838-839. doi: 10.1037/a0025890&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;*General&lt;/big&gt;
* Guidelines 1 through 3 encourage psychologists to act within the scope of their practice with regards to prescribing psychotropic medications, which includes seeking consultation before recommending certain medications; emphasize that psychologists' evaluate their own views and opinions towards prescribing medications in light of how it may affect communication with patients; and expect that psychologists involved in medication prescription or collaboration be wary of developmental, age, educational, sex, gender, language, health status, and cultural factors involved in populations a psychologist may serve, with regards to pharmacotherapy.
&lt;big&gt;*Education&lt;/big&gt;
* Guidelines 4 through 6 require that psychologists attain a level of education specific to pharmacotherapy in order to serve their clients; expect that psychologists be wary of potential adverse side effects of psychotropic medications; and ask that psychologists that prescribe or collaborate with regards to medication prescription be aware of helpful technological resources that are available.
&lt;big&gt;*Assessment&lt;/big&gt;
* Guidelines 7 through 9 require that psychologists familiarize themselves with procedures for monitoring the physiological and psychological effects of medications; expect that psychologists who prescribe medications consider other physiological disorders or underlying diseases that the patient may have that could affect the effectiveness of medications; and encourage psychologists to consider issues about patient adherence and concerns about medications.
&lt;big&gt;*Intervention and Consultation&lt;/big&gt;
* Guidelines 10 through 15 require that psychologists employ a biopsychosocial approach when prescribing medications and that they also use informed consent procedures, act in the best interest of the patient, and consider current research; emphasize that psychologists be wary of commercial influences regarding medications; and encourage psychologists to consider the patient's interpersonal behaviors.
&lt;big&gt;*Relationships&lt;/big&gt;
* Guidelines 16 and 17 expect that psychologists maintain appropriate relationships with other providers of psychological services and biological interventions.

== Supporting arguments ==
There are several core arguments put forth by RxP advocates, including the following:
* Other non-physicians have prescription privileges, such as [[pharmacist]]s, [[optometrist]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s, and [[physician assistant]]s. Some advocates have asserted that the latter three professions receive less training in clinical pharmacology, therapeutics, and psychopharmacology than many clinical psychologists.&lt;ref name="ericson"&gt;Ericson, Robert. (02/09/2002 ). [http://www.abqjournal.com/opinion/guest_columns/guest02-09-02.htm Prescription Privilege Based on Proven Model]. ''Albuquerque Journal''. Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The statistics point to multiple content areas in which the other professions, such as Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners, Physicians are relatively deficient in comparison to pharmacologically trained psychologists’ preparation.&lt;ref name="muse"&gt;Muse, M., &amp; McGrath, R. (2010). Training comparison among three professions prescribing psychoactive medications: psychiatric nurse practitioners, physicians, and pharmacologically trained psychologists. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 66(1), 96-103. doi:10.1002/jclp.20623.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The training model is supported by a complete lack of legal complaint after eight years regarding the practice of the initial ten psychologists trained by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name="ericson"/&gt; Legal complaints differ from legal suits, as military personnel cannot sue for redress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Feres v. United States]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Access to medication would be improved in jurisdictions with long waiting times to see a psychiatrist or other qualified physician.&lt;ref name="heiby"&gt;Heiby, E., DeLeon, P., and Anderson, T. (2004). A Debate on Prescription Privileges for Psychologists. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 35(4),'' 336.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prescriptive authority would be enhanced by the psychologist's doctoral training in the science of psychology, assessment, and psychotherapy.  This training is more extensive than that received by the average physician.  In addition, the training program for psychologists would provide twice as much pharmacology training than nurse practitioners and physician assistants receive .&lt;ref name="heiby"/&gt;
* It would address the fact that many lack access to psychiatrists (especially in rural areas).&lt;ref name="nappp"&gt;NAPPP. (2006). ''[http://www.nappp.org/rxpbill.php NAPPP Sponsors Prescriptive Authority Legislation].'' Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, Craig. (2006). Prescriptive Authority for Psychologists Working in the Public Sector: Is it Needed? ''Public Service Psychology, 31(1),'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It would create a clearer distinction between doctoral and masters-level practitioners,&lt;ref name="nappp"/&gt; and between doctoral and post-doctoral level practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Medical psychology]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In circumstances in which the psychologist decided not to collaborate with medical colleagues, it could allow the psychologist control of the entire treatment process.  In some cases, this might reduce or eliminate complications arising from interprofessional collaboration and potentially save clients money.&lt;ref name="nappp"/&gt;
* Psychologists with prescriptive authority would add competence to the overall mental health system by adding a resource for general practitioners who need professional consultation regarding psychological disorders and psychotropic medications when a psychiatrist is unavailable.&lt;ref name="holloway"&gt;Holloway, Jennifer. (2004). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/gaining.html Gaining prescriptive knowledge]. ''Monitor on Psychology, 35(6), 22&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychopharmaceutical training allows psychologists to provide better advocacy for their clients.&lt;ref name="holloway"/&gt;

According to a survey assessing the views of psychology interns, residents, and psychologists published in the journal [[Professional Psychology: Research and Practice]], significant support exists regarding the APA's prescriptive authority initiative.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Proponents of the prescriptive authority initiative believe that it would improve the economic stability of the profession, provide better opportunities to underserved populations, and enhance psychologists' clinical skills through a better understanding of biopsychosocial interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, T.J., Ax, R.K, Liss, M., Resnick, R.J., Moody, S.. (2007).  Prescriptive authority and preferences for training.  Professional psychology: Research and practice, 38(1), 104-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Support for the prescriptive authority initiative also appears higher amongst those with [[PsyD]]s and early-career psychologists than those with PhDs and mid- and late-career psychologists.  Demographically, females and Caucasians expressed more willingness to seek prescription privileges.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Also, those who attended a clinical or counseling graduate program, received a PhD degree, and those employed in a [[university counseling center]], medical school hospital, or independent practice tend to demonstrate higher levels of support for the initiative.  In terms of training, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed believe training should begin at the graduate level, but prior to completion of a doctorate. Additionally, respondents preferred that training occur on a part-time basis, be completed within two to two and a half years and cost $12,000-$18,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Today, evidence exists to indicate a continual and growing level of support for the American Psychological Association's prescriptive authority initiative.  Such support reflects psychologists' willingness to open their minds to learning about psychotropic medications, incorporating pharmacological treatment with therapy, and adapting to the demands of a rapidly changing health care world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Opposition==
{{Off topic|date=March 2011}}

Prescriptive authority for psychologists has been controversial, even within the healthcare community.which has created entire organizations dedicated to objecting to prescriptive authority for clinical psychologists.  Specifically, critics within the medical profession have expressed concern that they have no medical training.  The current RxP model explicitly states that this movement includes no medical training, But this can be accomplished with an abbreviated master's degree in [[psychopharmacology]], typically from a post-doctoral education program at a professional school. This would culminate in substantially fewer years and hours compared to [[physician assistant|Physicians assistants]] and [[nurse practitioner]]s, who are granted full prescriptive authority, and can elect to specialize in psychiatry, and unlike the majority of psychologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2010/03/as-nps-push-for-expanded-practice-rights-physicians-push-back/|title=As NPs push for expanded practice rights, physicians push back - The DO|date=2010-03-19|work=The DO|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Rich|date=2006-03-03|title=Psychiatrists Proactive in Scope-of-Practice Battles|url=https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.41.5.0017|journal=Psychiatric News|language=en|doi=10.1176/pn.41.5.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The strongest opposition to date has come from current psychiatrists who point out that psychologists (even after attending additional training) lack the proper general medical knowledge obtained in medical school and residency necessary to effectively and safely manage patients' care  (while exposing any patient to undue risk).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.com/07PoliticalActivities/rxp1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists opposing prescriptive authority fear caseload pressures that might press increasing numbers of psychologists to respond to patients' needs via only one treatment modality (pharmacology), as do many psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Progeny Testing''' is a test of the value for [[selective breeding]] of an individual's [[genotype]] by looking at the [[Offspring|progeny]] produced by different matings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everythingbio.com/glos/definition.php?word=progeny+testing progeny testing : Definition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progeny Testing ==
It is used in the [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] of both [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, but is most commercially important in [[animal breeding]] to determine the true breeding value of an animal esp. males which are used extensively for propagation of best germplasm. The extensive use of artificial insemination in domestic animals has helped in increasing the selection intensity on the male animals. This selection tool is usually used for characters that are sex-limited, expressed after death(meat characteristics) and usually with low heritability, for example milk or egg production in females. A bull for example cannot be assessed for milk production, however the performance of its female offsprings can be used to determine the use of the animal for future crosses. 
A progeny test is performed by mating the male with a number of females to produce many progenies in different environment and over a long time period involving different seasons to nullify the impact of season, management, environment in  breeding value estimation. The average performance of the offspring is then found, giving a measure of the male's respective value to the breeder.

In animals the progeny testing could be conducted in a large herd or involving associated herds or in the field in farmers place. The field based progeny testing is highly  required when the selected bulls are to be distributed in a large area, to many farmers in different environments. Conducting a field based progeny testing esp. in small holder production systems of Asia and Africa require huge resources both financial and infrastructural - a large AI network, robust and dynamic data collection and analysis system. Usually the breeding companies conduct progeny testing of their bulls so that they can be commercially promoted. But when the breeding organisations are Government controlled (eg.India), the onus of conducting the testing also lies with them if required genetic improvement is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nddb.org/English/Services/AB/Pages/Progeny-Testing.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528191331/http://www.nddb.org/English/Services/AB/Pages/Progeny-Testing.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''pulled elbow''', also known as a '''radial head subluxation''',&lt;ref name=Kru2017/&gt; is when the [[ligament]] that wraps around the [[radial head]] slips off.&lt;ref name=Bro2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browner|first1=EA|title=Nursemaid's Elbow (Annular Ligament Displacement)|journal=Pediatrics in Review|date=August 2013|volume=34|issue=8|pages=366–7; discussion 367|doi=10.1542/pir.34-8-366|pmid=23908364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a child will hold their arm against their body with the elbow slightly bent.&lt;ref name=Bro2013/&gt; They will not move the arm as this results in pain.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; Touching the arm, without moving the elbow, is usually not painful.&lt;ref name=Bro2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
A pulled elbow typically results from a sudden pull on an extended arm.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; This may occur when lifting or swinging a child by the arms.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; The underlying mechanism involves slippage of the [[annular ligament of radius|annular ligament]] off of the head of the radius followed by the ligament getting stuck between the radius and [[humerus]].&lt;ref name=Bro2013/&gt; Diagnosis is often based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; [[Radiography|Xrays]] may be done to rule out other problems.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology--&gt;
Prevention is by avoiding potential causes.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; Treatment is by [[reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]].&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; Moving the forearm into a [[pronation|palms down position]] with straightening at the elbow appears to be more effective than moving it into a [[supination|palms up position]] followed by [[flexion|bending]] at the elbow.&lt;ref name=Kru2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krul|first1=M|last2=van der Wouden|first2=JC|last3=Kruithof|first3=EJ|last4=van Suijlekom-Smit|first4=LW|last5=Koes|first5=BW|title=Manipulative interventions for reducing pulled elbow in young children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=28 July 2017|volume=7|pages=CD007759|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007759.pub4|pmid=28753234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bexkens|first1=R|last2=Washburn|first2=FJ|last3=Eygendaal|first3=D|last4=van den Bekerom|first4=MP|last5=Oh|first5=LS|title=Effectiveness of reduction maneuvers in the treatment of nursemaid's elbow: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=January 2017|volume=35|issue=1|pages=159–163|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2016.10.059|pmid=27836316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bro2013/&gt; Following a successful reduction the child should return to normal within a few minutes.&lt;ref name=Bro2013/&gt; A pulled elbow is common.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; It generally occurs in children between the ages of 1 and 4 years old, though it can happen up to 7 years old.&lt;ref name=OA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursemaid's Elbow|url=https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/nursemaids-elbow|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|accessdate=4 December 2017|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include:
* The child stops using the arm, which is held in extension (or slightly bent) and palm down.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|104158|Radial Head Subluxation Joint Reduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minimal swelling. 
* All movements are permitted except supination.
* Caused by longitudinal traction with the wrist in pronation, although in a series only 51% of people were reported to have this mechanism, with 22% reporting falls, and patients less than 6 months of age noted to have the injury after rolling over in bed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Cause==
This injury has also been reported in babies younger than six months and in older children up to the preteen years. There is a slight predilection for this injury to occur in girls and in the left arm. The classic mechanism of injury is longitudinal traction on the arm with the wrist in pronation, as occurs when the child is lifted up by the wrist. There is no support for the common assumption that a relatively small head of the radius as compared to the neck of the radius predisposes the young to this injury.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Pathophysiology==
The distal attachment of the annular ligament covering the radial head is weaker in children than in adults, allowing it to be more easily torn. The older child will usually point to the dorsal aspect of the proximal forearm when asked where it hurts. This may mislead one to suspect a buckle fracture of the proximal radius.&lt;ref name="emedicine.medscape.com"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|803026|Nursemaid Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no tear in the soft tissue (probably due to the pliability of young connective tissues).&lt;ref name="emedicine.medscape.com"/&gt;

The forearm contains two bones: the radius and the ulna. These bones are attached to each other both at the proximal, or elbow, end and also at the distal, or wrist, end. Among other movements, the forearm is capable of pronation and supination, which is to say rotation about the long axis of the forearm. In this movement the ulna, which is connected to the humerus by a simple hinge-joint, remains stationary, while the radius rotates, carrying the wrist and hand with it. To allow this rotation, the proximal (elbow) end of the radius is held in proximity to the ulna by a ligament known as the annular ligament. This is a circular ligamentous structure within which the radius is free, with constraints existing elsewhere in the forearm, to rotate.The proximal end of the radius in young children is conical, with the wider end of the cone nearest the elbow. With the passage of time the shape of this bone changes, becoming more cylindrical but with the proximal end being widened.

If the forearm of a young child is pulled, it is possible for this traction to pull the radius into the annular ligament with enough force to cause it to be jammed therein. This causes significant pain, partial limitation of flexion/extension of the elbow and total loss of pronation/supination in the affected arm. The situation is rare in adults, or in older children, because the changing shape of the radius associated with growth prevents it.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is often based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt; [[Radiography|Xrays]] may be done to rule out other problems.&lt;ref name=OA2014/&gt;

==Treatment==
To resolve the problem, the affected arm is moved in a way that causes the joint to move back into a normal position. The two main methods are hyperpronation and a combination of supination and flexion. Hyperpronation has a higher success rate and is less painful than a supination-flexion maneuver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bexkens|first1=R|last2=Washburn|first2=FJ|last3=Eygendaal|first3=D|last4=van den Bekerom|first4=MP|last5=Oh|first5=LS|title=Effectiveness of reduction maneuvers in the treatment of nursemaid's elbow: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=2 November 2016|pmid=27836316|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2016.10.059|volume=35|issue=1|pages=159–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kru2017"/&gt;

'''Qadhi Saeed Almurooshid''' (Arabic:قاضي سعيد المروشد), born 16 January 1971, is an Emirati businessman and a former member of the Government of [[Dubai]]. He currently serves as a member of several Dubai boards and as chairman of Al Murooshid Investment LLC.

== Early life and education ==

After completing his formative education in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Almurooshid continued his studies in the United States, where he graduated from [[Salem Teikyo University]], West Virginia in 1994 with a bachelor's in business administration and marketing.

== Department of Economic Development (1994–2001) ==

Following his graduation, Almurooshid returned to Dubai where he took his first position in the public sector in the [[Department of Economic Development (Dubai)|Department of Economic Development]]. Working within the compliance department he quickly rose to become the head of the newly established Commercial Protection Unit (CPU), and soon after, the head of the Corporate Service Centre. During his time with the CPU, Almurooshid worked closely with major corporations where he earned a reputation for his effective campaigning against issues such as piracy and counterfeit goods.

With a primary focus on supporting international companies and brands successfully establish themselves in the UAE; Almurooshid was part of the team that helped to cultivate a business friendly environment for corporations arriving in the region. Working not only among companies, but also sectors, Almurooshid was also key in establishing initiatives such as the [[Dubai Shopping Festival]] (DSF) in 1996 and Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS). In 1998 he was appointed as head of compliance, and became responsible for overseeing a team of seventy.

Almurooshid references his time with the economic department as an inspirational period of his development that helped to shape his on going career, and indeed, the department has been the foundry for many Emirati business figures and government officials.

== Executive Council of the Government of Dubai ==

Almurooshid was one of the first members of the Executive Council of Dubai, established under Law No.3 issued in 2003 by the royal decree of His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Prime Minister and Vice President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, in order address the Emirate's security, public services and economic and social progress. Almurooshid served as a founding member and vice chairman of the Executive Council’s Social Committee, member of the Budgetary Committee and member of the Safety and Justice Committee from 2007 till 2010.

== Dubai Health and Medical Services (DOHMS) (2002–2007) ==

Almurooshid was officially appointed director general of the Dubai Health and Medical Services (DOHMS) on 9 March 2002. As director general, Almurooshid, focused his administration towards increasing the integration of technology into national medical services as well as ensuring sufficient medical care for all, in line with the vision of His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], and under the directive of His Highness [[Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Deputy Ruler of Dubai and President of DOHMS.

=== Dubai Cord Blood &amp; Research Centre (2006) ===

Established in 2006, Almurooshid’s team opened the Dubai Cord Blood &amp; Research Centre on 6 June 2006 making it the first and only centre of its kind in the United Arab Emirates. As a licensed government entity, the centre was established to support the ongoing development of stem cell research as well as developing a more substantial registry of stem cells for the country.

=== Rashid Hospital Trauma Centre (2006) ===

Since taking the position as director general of DOHMS, Almurooshid led his team in the creation and development of [[Rashid Hospital]] Trauma Centre, the only fully integrated emergency department and regional facility dedicated to emergency and trauma care in the MENA region. With 130 beds, it operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and receives approximately 180,000 cases per annum, catering for a variety of acute emergencies such as medical, surgical, cardiac and neurology. The facility is also equipped with ten ambulance bays, two helipads, four state of the art resuscitation units, six operating theatres and the first STAT scanner in the region, and has an active emergency medicine residency training programme in support of the educational objectives of His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].

== Dubai Health Authority (DHA)(2007–2012) ==

In June 2007, the issue of Law No.13 by the royal decree of His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] transformed the DOHMS into the [[Dubai Health Authority]] (DHA). A separate decree thenselected Almurooshid as the most suitable candidate to again lead Dubai’s health care programme under the direction of His Highness [[Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum]], Crown Prince of Dubai and chairman of the Executive Council of the Government of Dubai, and was subsequently appointed as director general of the [[Dubai Health Authority]].

=== Primary Health Care Facilities ===

Almurooshid’s tenure as director general emphasised the realisation of the vision of His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] to provide primary health care for all citizens of the UAE. To this end, three primary healthcare centres, strategically placed to offer the maximum amount of coverage to their respective communities and costing approximately $19 million each were established in [[Nad Al Hammar]], [[Al Mizhar]] and [[Al Barsha]]. Today, the DHA has 14 primary healthcare centres, or one centre for every 30,000 individuals in the Emirate.&lt;ref name=PHC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubib.com/news/29326_dubai-diabetes-centre-winsbest-physical-environment-award-at-hospital-build-2012 |title=Dubai Diabetes Centre winsbest physical environment award at Hospital Build 2012 |publisher=Dubib.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dubai Diabetic Centre (2012) ===

Diabetes is a widespread issue in the United Arab Emirates with an estimated 20% of the population suffering from the disease. In response to this, during his tenure as the director general of DOHMS, Almurooshid signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Joslin Diabetes Center]] and Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joslin.org/news/dept_of_health_and_medical_services_and_emaar_healthcare_group_join.html |title=Department of Health and Medical Services and Emaar Healthcare Group Join Hands with Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians &amp;#124; Joslin Diabetes Center |publisher=Joslin.org |date=2007-06-10 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work together to set up an advanced diabetes centre in the [[Latifa Hospital]] in Dubai.

In June 2012, Almurooshid then announced the launch of a project for a new, state-of-the-art facility at Dubai Diabetic Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/New_Dubai_Diabetes_Centre_to_provide_the_most_comprehensive_treatment_in_diabetes_care_and_management-ZAWYA20120612092349/ |title=New Dubai Diabetes Centre to provide the most comprehensive treatment in diabetes care and management |publisher=Zawya |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering two and a half times the capacity of the existing centre to 20,000 square feet. Located on 2 December St, additional features included a paediatric endocrinology service, offering a more ‘child friendly’ experience to children under the age of 18 who suffer from the disease.

The centre also provided extensive podiatry, which is recognised as a highly important aspect of diabetes management. Almurooshid also introduced a new training programme for ten primary health care physicians from the DHA, bolstering the authority’s capacity for diabetes care and management.

=== Al Jalila Children’s Specialty Hospital (2008, estimated completion 2014) ===

Considered by Almurooshid as one of the most important projects overseen by his administration, the [[Al Jalila Children’s Specialty Hospital]]&lt;ref name="PHC"/&gt; was ordered by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum as a gift to the children of the UAE to celebrate his daughter Al Jalila’s first birthday on Tuesday 2 December 2008. The Dubai hospital covers a built up area of 76,500 square metres and is equipped with 200 beds and facilities such as a paediatric trauma, heart and transplant centres, coupled with surgical departments, outpatient facilities, dialysis equipment and oncology care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dha.gov.ae/En/media/news/pages/dhacommencessecondphaseconstructionofaljalilachildren%E2%80%99sspecialityhospital.aspx |title=DHA commences second phase construction of Al Jalila Children’s Speciality Hospital |publisher=Dha.gov.ae |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Al Jalila Hospital has been recognised as the first facility of its kind in the region, designed on the basis of extensive research and visits to globally renowned paediatric facilities in order to ensure that visiting children will be made to feel more at ease and less intimidated by their surroundings.

=== Establishment and restructuring of Dubai's ambulatory services ===

Dubai’s ambulatory services were restructured again by Almurooshid under the directive of Law No. 15 of 2010, issued by His Highness [[Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Ruler of Dubai, as Dubai Corporation for Ambulance Services (DCAS).

The following year Rashid, Dubai and Al Wasl hospitals, were acknowledged with the same credentials.

One of the more remarkable acknowledgements from the JCI came in 2010 when the Airport Medical Centre, located at Terminal 3 of [[Dubai International Airport]] was given accreditation for ambulatory standards, making it the first airport clinic to receive such recognition. Almurooshid presented the award to His Highness [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], president of [[Dubai Aviation City Corporation]] and chairman of [[Emirates Airline]].

}}The '''Radboud University Medical Center''' (Dutch: ''Radboudumc''), is the teaching hospital affiliated with the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], in the city of [[Nijmegen]] in the eastern-central part of the [[Netherlands]].

The Radboud University Medical Center was founded in 1956. It changed its name to ''UMC St Radboud'' and transformed to a complete new organization in 1999 by a merger of the ''Academisch Ziekenhuis Nijmegen'' (AZN) (Academic Hospital of Nijmegen) and the medical faculty of the ''Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen'' (Catholic University of Nijmegen), now the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. Thus, it is a semi-independent medical university and hospital, which is not directly linked to the Radboud University. In 2013 the hospital changed its name to ''Radboudumc'' in Dutch and ''Radboud University Medical Center'' in English. 
 
It is one of the largest and leading hospitals of The Netherlands, providing supraregional tertiary care for residents of a large part of the eastern section of The Netherlands.

The medical center has about 1,000 beds, employs about 10,000 employees, and offers educational services to about 3,000 students in the following academic courses:
* Medicine
* Biomedical Sciences
* Dentistry
* Molecular Mechanisms of Disease
* Cognitive Neurosciences

==Research==
The medical center's infrastructure consists of several technology centers and three research institutes:
* Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences
* Radboud Institute for Health Sciences 
* The Donders Center for Medical Neuroscience within the Donders Center for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and several technology centers

The scientists perform cross-disciplinary research regarding 18 clinically relevant research themes.

The '''roentgen equivalent man''' (or '''rem''')&lt;ref name=EPA2&gt;{{cite web|title=RADInfo Glossary of Radiation Terms|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|website=EPA.gov|url=https://www.epa.gov/enviro/radinfo-glossary-radiation-terms|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite|date=December 11, 2015|title=The First Line of Defense|first1=Jim|last1=Morris|first2=Jamie Smith|last2=Hopkins|work=Slate|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/nuclear_weapons_plants_are_killing_the_people_who_once_guarded_them_a_center.html|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an older, [[CGS]] unit of [[equivalent dose]], [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], and [[committed dose]] which are measures of the health effect of low levels of [[ionizing radiation]] on the human body. 

Quantities measured in rem are designed to represent the [[stochastic]] biological risk of ionizing radiation; primarily [[radiation-induced cancer]]. These quantities are derived from [[absorbed dose]], which in the CGS system has the unit [[rad (unit)|rad]] which is also an older unit. There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem; the conversion depends on [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE).

The rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01&amp;nbsp;[[sievert]], which is the more commonly used [[SI unit]] outside the United States. A number of earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the [[roentgen unit]], which was named after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], a German scientist who discovered [[X-ray]]s. The acronym is now a misleading historical artifact, since 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity. Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem.

One rem carries with it a 0.05% chance of eventually developing cancer.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause [[acute radiation syndrome]] (ARS), possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated. Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms. The [[absorbed dose]], measured in [[rad (unit)|rad]], is the best indicator of ARS.&lt;ref name="remdef"&gt;''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Revised ed., US DOD 1962&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|592–593}}

A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the '''millirem''' ('''mrem'''), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and [[background radiation|background]] sources.

==Usage==
The rem and millirem are [[CGS units]] in widest use among the American public, industry, and government.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation: Risks and Realities|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=000003JH.txt|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 May 2012|author1=Office of Air and Radiation |author2=Office of Radiation and Indoor Air|page=2|format=PDF|date=May 2007|quote=In the United States, we measure radiation doses in units called rem. Under the metric system, dose is measured in units called sieverts. One sievert is equal to 100 rem.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International System of Units|SI]] units are the norm outside of the United States, and they are increasingly encountered within the US in academic, scientific, and engineering environments.

The conventional units for dose rate is mrem/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mrem/yr or rem/yr, where they are understood to represent the total amount of radiation allowed (or received) over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual total exposure limits. There is no exact conversion from hours to years because of leap years, but approximate conversions are:
:1 mrem/h = 8766 mrem/yr
:0.1141 mrem/h = 1000 mrem/yr 
The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units|year=1950|publisher=US Department of Commerce|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:8 h = 1 day
:40 h = 1 week
:50 week = 1 yr
Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,
:1 mrem/h = 2000 mrem/yr
:0.5 mrem/h = 1000 mrem/yr

The US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) strongly discourages Americans from expressing doses in rem, in favor of recommending the SI unit.&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)|year=2008|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|location=Gaithersburg, MD|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/sp811/index.cfm|edition=2008|accessdate=28 November 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YWY1pd2K?url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html|id=SP811|page=10|archivedate=12 June 2008|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIST recommends defining the rem in relation to the SI in every document where this unit is used.&lt;ref name="fedreg63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hebner|first=Robert E.|title=Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States|journal=Federal Register|date=1998-07-28|volume=63|issue=144|page=40339|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-07-28/pdf/98-16965.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For US industries and US firms that do not require the sole use of SI, however, the unit rem is often preferred.

== Health effects ==
Ionizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. The deterministic effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of high doses (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~10&amp;nbsp;rad or &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~10&amp;nbsp;rad/h or &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h). A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose. To avoid confusion, deterministic effects are normally compared to absorbed dose in units of rad, not rem.

Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] at a rate of 0.055% per rem (5.5%/Sv).&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2–4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2|last1=Icrp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peck |first1=Donald J.|title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk |url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx|publisher=Image Wisely |accessdate=18 May 2012 |author2=Samei, Ehsan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book|first=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|title=Effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes|year=2008|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-142263-4|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much less data, and much more controversy, regarding the possibility of [[cardiac]] and [[teratogenic]] effects, and the modelling of [[internal dose]].&lt;ref name="ECRR2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=European Committee on Radiation Risk|title=2010 recommendations of the ECRR : the health effects of exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation|year=2010|publisher=Green Audit|location=Aberystwyth|isbn=978-1-897761-16-8|url=http://www.euradcom.org/2011/ecrr2010.pdf|edition=Regulators'|editor=Busby, Chris|accessdate=18 May 2012|display-editors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721220541/http://www.euradcom.org/2011/ecrr2010.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 100 mrem (1 mSv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt;  For comparison, radiation levels inside the US [[United States Capitol]] are 85 mrem/yr (0.85 mSv/yr), close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP" &gt;{{cite web|last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program|title=Radiation in the Environment|url=http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/projmain.html|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20&amp;nbsp;yr&amp;nbsp;× 85&amp;nbsp;mrem/yr&amp;nbsp;× 0.001&amp;nbsp;rem/mrem&amp;nbsp;× 0.055%/rem =&amp;nbsp;~0.1%) That "existing risk" is much higher; an average person would have a one in ten chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation.

==History==
The concept of the rem first appeared in the literature in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cantrill|first1=S.T|author2=H.M. Parker|title=The Tolerance Dose|date=1945-01-05|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA322447|accessdate=14 May 2012|publisher=US Atomic Energy Commission|location=Argonne National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given its first definition in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nucleonics|year=1947|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition was refined in 1950 as "that dose of any ionizing radiation which produces a relevant biological effect equal to that produced by one [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] of high-voltage x-radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=H.M.|title=Tentative Dose Units for Mixed Radiations|journal=Radiology|year=1950|volume=54|issue=2|pages=257–262|doi=10.1148/54.2.257|pmid=15403708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using data available at the time, the rem was variously evaluated as 83, 93, or 95 erg/gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elda E.|title=Units of Radiation and Radioactivity|journal=Public Health Reports|date=March 1952|volume=67|issue=3|pages=293–297|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2030726/pdf/pubhealthreporig01075-0073.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2012|doi=10.2307/4588064|pmc=2030726|pmid=14900367|jstor=4588064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the introduction of the [[rad (unit)|rad]] in 1953, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) decided to "continue" the use of the rem. The US [[National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] noted in 1954 that this effectively implied an increase in the magnitude of the rem to match the rad (100 erg/gram).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Permissible Doses from External Sources of Radiation|publisher=US Department of Commerce|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2059%20Addendum.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|page=31|date=24 September 1954|series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook|volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRP officially adopted the rem as the unit of [[equivalent dose]] in 1962 to measure the way different types of radiation distribute energy in tissue, and began recommending values of [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) for various types of radiation.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In practice, the unit of rem was used to denote that an RBE factor had been applied to a number which was originally in units of rad or roentgen. In 1977 the rem was redefined by the ICRP as 0.01 [[sievert]] or 0.01 J/kg, with the intention that the sievert would come to replace the rem.

The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) adopted the sievert in 1980, but never accepted the use of the rem. The US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) recognizes that this unit is outside the SI, but temporarily accepts its use in the US with the SI.&lt;ref name="fedreg63" /&gt; The rem remains in widespread use as an industry standard in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Radiation Effects'', 2nd edition, 2002, Andrew Holmes-Siedle and Len Adams&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission still permits the use of the units [[curie]], rad and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ryan''''' is a 2004 [[animated documentary]] created and [[Film director|directed]] by [[Chris Landreth]] about Canadian animator [[Ryan Larkin]], who had lived on [[skid row]] in [[Montreal]] as a result of [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]]. Landreth's chance meeting with Larkin in 2000 inspired him to develop the film, which took 18 months to complete. It was co-produced by Copper Heart Entertainment and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and its creation and development is the subject of the NFB documentary ''Alter Egos''. The film incorporated material from [[archive]] sources, particularly Larkin's works at the NFB.

The film is an animated interpretation of an [[interview]] of Larkin by Landreth, and includes interviews with Larkin's previous partner and coworkers, as well as Landreth. Development of the characters was partially inspired by the [[plastination|plastinated]] human bodies of the [[Body Worlds]] exhibition. The distorted and disembodied appearance of the film's characters is based on Landreth's use of [[psychological realism]] to portray emotion visually, and expression is modelled by use of [[straight ahead animation]]. The animation was created at the Animation Arts Centre of [[Seneca College]] in [[Toronto]]. Some of the animation was based on ''cords'', mathematical equations modelling the physical properties of curves and used to animate filamentous objects in the film. The visual effects of the film has been described by reviewers and [[Film criticism|film critics]] as difficult to describe and having a distinctive visceral style.

''Ryan'' won over 60 awards, including the 2004 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CGR0T9-Qho Short Film Oscars:2005 Oscars]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[25th Genie Awards|25th Genie Award]] for Best Animated Short. It was presented and won awards at many [[film festival]]s, including [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], &lt;!-- [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], --&gt; and [[CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival|Worldwide Short Film Festival]]. It also won Jury awards at [[SIGGRAPH]] and the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], and honourable mention at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

As a result of the film's popularity, Larkin became famous once again and received requests for his animation services. He began work with Laurie Gordon on an animated film ''Spare Change'' about his panhandling on the streets of Montreal, and created several [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] for [[MTV Canada]]. Larkin died in 2007, and ''Spare Change'' was completed by Gordon and released in 2008. Landreth received offers to produce [[feature film]]s, but instead chose to continue producing animated short films, releasing ''[[The Spine (film)|The Spine]]'' in 2009.

==Background==
Larkin was a Canadian animator who had worked at the National Film Board of Canada in the 1960s and 1970s, producing several celebrated works.{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}} Best known for his film ''[[Walking (film)|Walking]]''{{sfn|Waugh|2006|p=451}} composed of animated vignettes of people walking, Larkin was considered one of the best animators of his generation.{{sfn|Louguet|Maheu|2011|p=256}} In 1969, the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' referred to him as the "[[Frank Zappa]] or [[George Harrison]] of animation".{{sfn|Slade|1969|p=71}} In the 1970s, unable to cope with his success and the pressure to develop more works, and facing a [[Writer's block|creative block]], he became addicted to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=130}}{{sfn|Louguet|Maheu|2011|p=256}} By 1978, he was broke and no longer working for the NFB.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} He worked as a commercial animator and painter for the next ten years,{{sfn|Dixon|2008}}{{sfn|Stone|2007}} but by the late 1980s he was living in the streets of Montreal.{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=77}} He continued to draw and sculpt.{{sfn|Dixon|2008}}

[[Chris Robinson (writer)|Chris Robinson]] first learned of Larkin in 2000 after his name was mentioned in a discussion by staff member Lesya Fesiak, who had heard about Larkin [[Begging|panhandling]] in Montreal from a friend.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}} Fesiak and Robinson, who is the director of the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]], drove to Montreal to meet Larkin in June 2000,{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=31}} where they found him panhandling near [[Schwartz's]] on [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]].{{sfn|Dixon|2007}}{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}} At the time, he resided at the [[Old Brewery Mission]]{{sfn|Dixon|2005}}{{sfn|Whyte|2006|p=A3}} and spent his days "wandering around town" visiting art galleries, museums, and libraries.{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=37}} He always had a notepad with him for drawing.{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=37}} They offered him dinner at a nearby bar, where he recounted his life story, which Robinson found "comical and heartbreaking, pathetic and inspiring".{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}} Before leaving, Robinson invited Larkin to Ottawa to watch a few entries for that year's film festival.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}}

Landreth met Larkin at the suggestion of Robinson. Landreth had been taking part in the festival's selection committee when a fourth member of the committee dropped out. Robinson asked Larkin to take the missing committee member's place, and personally drove him to Ottawa in July 2000.{{sfn|Singer|2004}}{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=39}} Committee members Landreth, Pjotr Sapegin, and Andrei Svislotksi, in addition to Larkin, reviewed the commissioned films competition entries.{{sfn|Teninge|2000}} Nobody on the selection committee knew of Larkin's identity at the time,{{sfn|Stone|2007}} and Landreth found his presence on the committee to be odd.{{sfn|Hutsul|2005|p=F1}} Committee members were only told about Larkin's identity at the end of the viewings,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=260}} when they screened each other's films.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} Larkin was last, showing ''Walking'', ''[[Street Musique]]'', and ''Syrinx''.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}{{sfn|Singer|2004}} Landreth later described his surprise, and stated "I looked at him and wondered, how did this happen?"{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}

Landreth, at the time employed by [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias]],{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}} was "immediately inspired" to create a film based on Larkin's life, but waited a few months before acting on it.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Singer|2004}} He met Larkin again in September during the Ottawa International Animation Festival, and asked him if he would agree to be the subject of a film.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}} Larkin agreed, and on 13 February 2001, Landreth decided to make the film.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=261}}{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}}

==Development==
Landreth spent several years developing the film.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}} Instead of first creating a [[storyboard]] on which the animation would be based, he conceived the theme after interviews with Larkin.{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=86}} After the [[screenplay]] was developed, the production followed a more typical process of creating a storyboard, character modelling, scene design, animation, and post-production.{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=86}}

In February 2001, Landreth contacted [[Film producer|producer]] Steven Hoban at Copper Heart Entertainment.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}} Hoban liked the concept for the film, and wanted to include it as a [[3D rendering]] in the [[IMAX]] film [[CyberWorld]] he was producing.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}} A manager rejected the idea, as the subject material was deemed to be inappropriate for CyberWorld's young target audience.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}}

A production team was assembled with Copper Heart Entertainment, and it received a [[Grant (money)|grant]] from the [[Canada Council for the Arts]].{{sfn|Landreth's Ryan wins}}{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} The National Film Board of Canada agreed to be a co-producer.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} Landreth also secured studio space at the Animation Arts Centre of [[Seneca College]] in [[Toronto]],{{sfn|Mandell|2005|p=29}}{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} and in 2003 four graduates and fifteen undergraduates from its 3D Animation program were recruited to work on the film.{{sfn|Brown|2005}}{{sfn|Kriger|2011|p=161}}{{sfn|Mandell|2005|p=29 sidebar|ps=: The 19 students were David Baas, Dave Bachelor, Larry DeFlorio, [[Robb Denovan]], Bill Dwelly, Wadi Ejiwunmi, Heather Gagnier, Martin Hesselink, Terry Kalinich, Sebastian Kapijimpanga, Joseph Kim, Paul Kohut, Martin Kumor, Brian Lemay, Steven Lin, Jeff Panko, Joe Raasch, Gavin Soares, and Derek Verdonck.}} The core development team consisted of one [[computer graphics]] supervisor, four [[animator]]s, one texture mapper, one renderer, two set modellers, and a few character modellers.{{sfn|Landreth|2005}}

In the summer of 2001, he conducted several interviews with Larkin, who gave Landreth carte blanche for the project.{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}}{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=77}}{{sfn|Whyte|2006|p=A3}} Landreth accumulated about 20 hours of [[audio footage]], but did not think it was sufficient material on which to base a story, so in August he interviewed him again, this time asking about his alcoholism.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} Larkin, who had been drinking throughout the interview, responded angrily,{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=41}} and this would become the "climactic moment in the film".{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} This led Landreth to change the production from a story primarily narrated by Larkin to an interview-style [[cinéma vérité]] documentary in which Landreth's character had a larger role.{{sfn|Singer|2004}}{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=88}}{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=91}}

Landreth acquired a comprehensive set of Larkin's works from the National Film Board of Canada and other reference material.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} He also conducted interviews with Felicity Fanjoy, who had been Larkin's girlfriend in the past, and Derek Lamb, who directed films at the NFB{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}}{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=90}}{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=77}} and was a producer for Larkin in the 1970s.{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=130–131}} He used the interviews and reference material to create a script, which he completed by December.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}

The animation used the technique of [[psychological realism]], blending dialogue from interviews with subjective screen characters who are "sometimes fragmented, distorted, or in some way unusual".{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}} The representation of the characters was partly inspired by [[Body Worlds]], a [[travelling exhibition]] of human bodies preserved by [[plastination]] to reveal internal [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures.{{sfn|Siddiqui|2005}}

Landreth has stated that Larkin's character in the film is a subjective interpretation based on his own ideology and experiences, citing one of his favourite quotations "we don't see things as they are, we see things as we are".{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=132}} He animated Larkin as a beaten character "battered by years of substance abuse and still bearing the scars of his artistic failure".{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=130}} Landreth stated that the visual appearance of the characters "reflect pain, insanity, fear, mercy, shame, and creativity",{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} and that the effect was to show the characters' "souls or mental states or psyches".{{sfn|Kriger|2011|p=146}}

Landreth incorporated Larkin's alcoholism as part of the narrative of the film, at first in the background as Larkin sips from a [[thermos]], and later directly as Landreth asks Larkin about his alcoholism.{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=131}} The attention to Larkin's alcoholism also reflects Landreth's mother's troubles with alcohol.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=64}}

Pre-production and production took about 18 months.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}{{sfn|Brown|2005}}{{sfn|Singer|2004}} Use of the Seneca College computing infrastructure, which was loaned for free for the production, was valued by NFB producer Marcy Page at about {{currency|250000|CAD}}.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005}} [[Intel]] donated the use of a [[render farm]] for the production.{{sfn|Landreth|2005}} The overall cost to produce ''Ryan'' was about {{currency|900000|CAD}}.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005}}

The film was dedicated to Landreth's mother, Barbara.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=64}}

==Animation==
[[File:Cafeteria rendered using nonlinear perspective in the film Ryan.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grey wall with two doors is in the background, a chalkboard in its centre, and ceiling fans and hanging lights are overhead. In the foreground are two long cafeteria tables extending into the background, each having ten chairs; other tables are partially visible to the left and right.|The cafeteria appears to have been rendered by nonlinear projection when viewed from a linear perspective camera]]

The animation consists of three-dimensional avatars representing the interview subjects, each "mutilated and deformed in ways expressive of emotional and artistic trauma".{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=77}} The film uses emotional realism instead of photorealism, using graphic elements to represent the characters' state of mind.{{sfn|Power|2009|p=118–119}} There is a shift between techniques throughout the animation, particularly the use of hand-drawn vectors, [[rotoscoping]], and 3D rendering of characters and the environments in which they are set.{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=78}} The setting is a dilapidated cafeteria in which the characters representing Larkin and Landreth are seated across from each other at a table.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} It was chosen to bring the characters into one setting for interaction, instead of having to deal with multiple settings.{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=88}} It also provides a neutral setting with a relaxed atmosphere to mitigate any initial bias toward the characters.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=61}} In some scenes, [[colour correction]] was used to "achieve a dark mood".{{sfn|Discreet Logic|2005}}

Incorporated into the film in their entirety are two of Larkin's most famous animated shorts, ''Walking'' and the 1972 line animation ''Street Musique''.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=62}}{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=77}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} As Larkin's character dances with one of the characters from ''Street Musique'', [[Stroboscope|stroboscoping]] arms are shown, an homage to ''[[Pas de deux (film)|Pas de deux]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]], Larkin's mentor at the NFB.{{sfn|Singer|2004}} An animated rendering of Larkin attending the [[42nd Academy Awards]] in 1970 is also included.{{sfn|Dixon|2005}}{{sfn|Doyle|2004}}

Animators were required to present a "continuously varying viewpoint" using distortion effects on a linear perspective camera.{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=5}} Each object in the three-dimensional scene had to be independently specified, and [[Composition (visual arts)|frame composition]] had to be independent of the projection.{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=5}} Three types of projection systems were used for the production of ''Ryan'': [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective linear projection]] for lines converging at a common vanishing point, [[Parallel projection|parallel linear projection]] for objects to maintain "parallel line relationships", and nonlinear projection for curvilinear distortion of nearby objects.{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=6}} The latter was defined by the viewing and projection transformations of the cameras and spatial [[weight function]]s applied to each camera.{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=7}} Included in the model was support for independent manipulation of two-dimensional [[Transformation (function)|transformations]], particularly for changing an object's [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[rotation]], and [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]].{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=27}} The model was then incorporated into [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] for animation using scene geometry deformation.{{sfn|Coleman|2004|p=7}}{{sfn|Power|2009|p=121}} This would render "multiple simultaneous projections and camera angles" to a single frame.{{sfn|Power|2009|p=121}} The nonlinear projections were also used to establish a "cinematic mood" for the setting.{{sfn|Power|2009|p=121}}

===Software and algorithms===
[[File:Chris Landreth's character in Ryan, with coloured threads.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A digitally rendered version of Chris Landreth's face, slightly tilted downward, on a dark grey background. Ribbons of various colours wrap around his head in various orientations.|The coloured threads wrapped around Chris Landreth's character's face were animated using algorithms created by the Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems]]

The students at Seneca College used eight [[workstation]]s with "the latest 3D digital technology".{{sfn|Mandell|2005|p=29}} The [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] software by Alias (now part of [[Autodesk]]) was used for [[3D modeling]], [[Skeletal animation|rigging]], [[Computer graphics lighting|lighting]], rendering, and animation.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=261}}{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Alias Systems|2005}} The brushes ''smear'', ''blur'', and ''erase'' were used extensively to create the psychological realism effects of the film.{{sfn|Kundert-Gibbs|Kunzendorf|Derakhshani|Larkins|2006|p=552}} Landreth stated that Maya was chosen because of its paint effects, which were an integral part of the film.{{sfn|Landreth|2005}}

[[Combustion (software)|Discreet Combustion]] was used for [[Digital compositing|compositing]] and all [[2D computer graphics]].{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=261}}{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Discreet Logic|2005}} According to lead compositor Belma Abdicevic, the frequently used compositing tools were paint, colour correction, and motion blur.{{sfn|Discreet Logic|2005}} [[Adobe Photoshop]] was used for painting and [[texture mapping]], and [[Adobe Premiere]] was used for creative development and editing.{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Singer|2004}}

Landreth contacted Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS), a network funded by the [[Government of Canada]], to create [[algorithm]]s for digitally modelling and rendering hair.{{sfn|Mathematicians celebrate Oscar win}} The MITACS team, headed by computer science associate professor Karan Singh of the [[University of Toronto]], created a mathematical formula known as a ''cord'', which is used to represent the physical characteristics of animated curves.{{sfn|Mathematicians celebrate Oscar win}} The cord was based on a [[cubic function]] with uniform [[parametrization]].{{sfn|Coleman|Singh|2004|p=47}} This cord enables rope-like objects, such as hair, string, or wire, to "behave intuitively" when rendered in animation, preserving "length, elasticity and stiffness".{{sfn|Mathematicians celebrate Oscar win}} Implemented using Maya, cords could be generated by defining a ''guide curve'', a [[Parametric equation|parametric curve]] in space, which the software would then follow to create an [[Analytic function|analytic]], continuous shape wrapping around scene geometry.{{sfn|Coleman|Singh|2004|p=11–14}} Singh was the software [[research and development]] director for the film.{{sfn|Sawhney|2005}} The MITACS team also executed all technical scripting and programming for the animation.{{sfn|Sawhney|2005}}

===Characters===
Although it appears to be [[live action]], all aspects of character movement are rendered animations conceived for the film,{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=130}}{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} and are not based on [[motion capture]].{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=65}} Patrick Louguet and Fabien Maheu state that the characters are brought to life as disembodied, skinned, and broken.{{sfn|Louguet|Maheu|2011|p=256}} The characters have faces that are "dissipated and decimated", representing each individual's personal demons, and temporary protrusions from the head represent emotions.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}{{sfn|Baumgartner|2004}} Larkin's character is presented as incomplete and fragile,{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=62}} and is the "most ravaged of all the characters".{{sfn|Mills|2010|p=68}}

About half of the facial animation was performed by Landreth, and the other half by the Seneca College students.{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} Character expression and gesture was modelled using [[straight ahead animation]],{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} which was used to avoid the cartoonish style of "one gesture per accent of dialogue" in pose-to-pose animation.{{sfn|Besen|2004}} Landreth chose this style after having studied anatomy and [[biomechanics]], and a body's expression of emotion, such as finger movements and [[facial expression]]s.{{sfn|Besen|2004}} The expression of Larkin's character changes from [[nostalgia]], joy, anger, anxiety, nervousness, defensiveness, and passivity during the film.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=63}} The thermos is imbued with character, persistently demanding Larkin's attention, who submits to it compulsively.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=64}} The settings also exhibit character, morphing at times reflecting the state of mind of the primary characters.{{sfn|Mills|2010|p=67}}

Landreth directed the animators to use graph editing rather than the [[exposure sheet]]s typically used in 2D animation.{{sfn|Besen|2004}} The latter enable an animator to "break down the individual motions in a character", but Landreth preferred an approach that did not involve characters moving in curves.{{sfn|Besen|2004}} He wanted the characters to portray realistic motion, which begins with an abrupt twitch for a [[muscle contraction]] and must also account for momentum and mass.{{sfn|Besen|2004}} For example, Landreth stated that an individual's arm should be slightly in front of the body, at 30 degrees with respect to the "scapular plane of the skeleton".{{sfn|O'Hailey|2013|p=181}}

Cords are used to animate coloured threads that wrap themselves around the character's heads, and are used [[metaphor]]ically in the film to represent Landreth's [[fear of failure]] and Larkin's loss of creativity.{{sfn|Honess Roe|2013|p=130}} The use of coloured threads is explained by Landreth's character in [[first-person narrative]] at the beginning of the film as metaphorically representing emotional scars and frustrations.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=60}} Landreth's character is rendered so that a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] appears above his head "when he gets too sanctimonious".{{sfn|Dixon|2004}} Other characters appear when mentioned by Larkin,{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=90}} rendered as three-dimensional interpretations of Larkin's sketches.{{sfn|Mills|2010|p=69}}

===Soundtrack===
The [[soundtrack]] consists of audio from previously recorded interviews, and uses a technique employed in the development of [[Aardman Animation]]'s 1989 film ''[[Creature Comforts]]''.{{sfn|Armitage|2011|p=78}} It uses character action to reveal "the half-truths and self-deceptions of the dialogue".{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}&lt;!-- source has no pagination info --&gt; Throughout, Landreth narrates the story based on information obtained from the interviews and the archives.{{sfn|Martinelli|2012|p=59}} Landreth did not remove Larkin's [[Stuttering|stutter]], a condition resultant from Larkin's cocaine use.{{sfn|Mills|2010|p=68}}

==Reception==
''Ryan'' debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2004,{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=151}}{{sfn|Robertson|2004}} where it was well received.{{sfn|O'Hara|2004}} Its Canadian debut was at the [[CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival|Worldwide Short Film Festival]],{{sfn|Desowitz|2004}} and it was later shown at the Ottawa International Animation Festival, for which Robinson arranged to screen ''Walking'' in the Friday night competition as a special event and for [[publicity]].{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=151}} Its US premiere was at [[SIGGRAPH]] 2004 in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Desowitz|2004}}

[[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the film in his coverage of Academy Award nominees, stating that the "animation technique is dramatic, striking and wholly original" and that the "effect is hard to describe, impossible to forget".{{sfn|Ebert|2005}}{{sfn|Ebert|2007|p=525}} The Toronto Film Critics' Association stated that ''Ryan'' was "an historic achievement in Canadian animation".{{sfn|Lacey|2004}} David Kehr stated in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that ''Ryan'' is a "work of art that exists on its own highly original terms".{{sfn|Kehr|2005}} F.C. Luz stated that ''Ryan'' is an example of the "new visual and narrative forms" enabled by [[computer-generated imagery]].{{sfn|Luz|2010|p=565}}

Rick Baumgartner of [[Animation World Network]] described ''Ryan'' as a "3D hand-animated symphony of creativity and color" with a "visceral graphic style".{{sfn|Baumgartner|2004}} M.J. Stone of [[The Globe and Mail]] stated that the film has "astonishing imagery".{{sfn|Stone|2007}} Ellen Besen stated that "breaking away from the one gesture per accent standard is a hallmark of Landreths approach".{{sfn|Besen|2004}}

Larkin had a "pained reaction to his psychorealistic portrayal", stating that he was not fond of his "skeleton image".{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}} Landreth stated that Larkin first found his character's appearance in the film disturbing, but came to like it after realizing that all the characters in the film had a "disconnected, distorted appearance".{{sfn|Singer|2004}}

==Accolades==
By 2007, the film had won over 60 awards, including:{{sfn|Heatherington|2007}}{{sfn|Robertson|2004}}

The film also received honourable mention at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival for short filmmaking.{{sfn|Sundance Film Festival}} It was one of ''Canada's Top Ten'' features of 2004 compiled by the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].{{sfn|Toronto International Film Festival}}

Larkin attended the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]], and when it was announced as the grand prize winner, accompanied Landreth to the stage and "took a bow".{{sfn|Landreth|2005}} The NFB invited Larkin to attend the Academy Awards, but he declined the offer.{{sfn|Dixon|2005}} The NFB sent staff to [[Los Angeles]] one month before the Academy Awards in order to promote ''Ryan'', the "most aggressive Oscar campaign" it had ever undertaken.{{sfn|Taylor|2005}}

Landreth dedicated the Academy Award to Larkin, stating in his acceptance speech that receiving the award was made possible because of "the grace and humility of one guy watching in Montreal".{{sfn|Stone|2007}} Larkin was watching the Academy Awards with friends at Copacabana, his favourite Montreal bar which he also referred to as his "office".{{sfn|Landreth's Ryan wins}}{{sfn|Dixon|2005}} He did not hear the speech because his friends and other bar patrons were cheering loudly and congratulating him after the film was announced as the winner.{{sfn|Quinn|2005|p=E2}}

Landreth hoped that winning the Academy Award would enable him to convince theatre operators to include ''Ryan'' preceding a full-length film in order to obtain greater mainstream exposure.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005}} In Canada, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) bought [[Broadcast syndication|first window broadcast rights]] for ''Ryan'' and ''Alter Egos'', and [[Alliance Atlantis]] bought second window rights.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005}} The CBC had already broadcast both films on ''[[The Passionate Eye]]'' and ''[[Rough Cuts (TV series)|Rough Cuts]]''.{{sfn|Taylor|2005}} The NFB also signed agreements with specialty channels in Canada, the United States, and Europe to broadcast the film.{{sfn|Taylor|2005}}

''Ryan'' was in the 2004 collection of the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]], and was included in the 11th volume and second box set it released.{{sfn|Acme Filmworks}}

The top and bottom are split by a solid black bar with the title of the film using random capitalization.|Poster for the film ''Spare Change'' created by Ryan Larkin and Laurie Gordon, and completed by Gordon after Larkin's death.]]
Owing to the film's popularity, Larkin "found himself gaining unusual fame for someone who supposedly lived in obscurity".{{sfn|Dixon|2008}} Larkin stated that because of the film, "there are millions of people out there wanting to see another Ryan Larkin film".{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}} Landreth established a fund at the Old Brewery Mission for Larkin{{sfn|Maguire|2005}} who in 2005 began working on an animated film titled ''Spare Change'' about his panhandling on the streets of Montreal{{sfn|DeMott|2006}}{{sfn|DeMott|2007}} based on [[poem]]s he had recently written.{{sfn|Stone|2007}} It was a collaboration with composer Laurie Gordon of the band Chiwawa,{{sfn|DeMott|2007}} who would be responsible for the film's music and voices.{{sfn|Stone|2007}} When he began the project, he continued to panhandle on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, stating that "I can't disappoint my clientele".{{sfn|Dixon|2005}} He was one of the panhandlers interviewed for the [[documentary film]] ''Chez Schwartz'' about the delicatessen.{{sfn|Dixon|2006}}

In 2006, Larkin signed a contract with [[MTV Canada]] to create three five-second [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] that aired on 25 and 26 December 2006.{{sfn|DeMott|2006}}{{sfn|Stone|2007}} They were the only [[Station identification|channel IDs]] to be broadcast by MTV Canada on those days.{{sfn|DeMott|2006}} He died on [[Valentine's Day]] 2007 as a result of [[lung cancer]] that had [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to his [[brain]].{{sfn|DeMott|2007}} The ten-minute animation{{sfn|Dixon|2007}} ''Spare Change'' was completed alone by Gordon, and premiered in a [[double bill]] with ''[[All Together Now (film)|All Together Now]]'' at the [[Festival du nouveau cinéma]] in Montreal on 8 October 2008.{{sfn|Dixon|2008}} The two films were shown together in theatres throughout Canada that month.{{sfn|Dixon|2008}} Gordon and Nicola Zavaglia later released ''Ryan's Renaissance'', a [[documentary film]] about Larkin and ''Spare Change''.{{sfn|Doyle|2011}}

Robinson stated in his book ''Ballad of a Thin Man: In Search of Ryan Larkin'' that although Larkin did not change because of the new-found attention, that "by knowing him, he seems to trigger change in others".{{sfn|Robinson|2009|p=146–147}} In the book ''The Animation Pimp'', Robinson states that he "quit drinking and started to make amends for the swamp of a life I created" after his few meetings with Larkin.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=264}}

The eleven Seneca College students who were responsible for the animation of Ryan all found employment in the animation industry.{{sfn|Mandell|2005|p=29}} Landreth received offers to produce [[feature film]]s, but rejected them to create another animated short film,{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=44}} ''[[The Spine (film)|The Spine]]'', which was released in 2009 and used the same production team and psychological realism technique that was used in ''Ryan''.{{sfn|Heatherington|2007}} The software model created for the production of ''Ryan'' was the basis for a [[Master of Science]] thesis by Patrick Coleman.{{sfn|Coleman|2004}}

''Ryan'' is considered to be one of the high-profile examples of animated documentary.{{sfn|Pilling|2013}} It was screened at the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in November 2005, during which the Body Worlds exhibit was on display.{{sfn|Siddiqui|2005}} The film ''Alter Egos'' was commissioned by the NFB to document the making of ''Ryan'',{{sfn|Davis|Vladica|2010}} and includes interviews with Landreth, Larkin, and others.{{sfn|National Film Board of Canada}}{{sfn|Dixon|January 2007}}

      <comment>SAE Criterion 5 may have been interpreted like a birth defect of a trial subject itself was an SAE, instead it is an SAE if it has to be suspected "that exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child" as stated in the source linked.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">A '''serious [[adverse event]]''' (SAE) in human [[drug]] trials is defined as any untoward
medical occurrence that at any dose 
#results in death,
#is [[Death|life-threatening]]
#requires inpatient [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]] or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization
#results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
#may have caused a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
#requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053087.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.&lt;ref name=Defs&gt;{{cite web | author=Expert Working Group (Efficacy) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). | title=Guideline for Industry - Clinical safety data management: definitions and standards for expedited reporting. | url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/iche2a.pdf | format=PDF | date=August 25, 2007 | publisher=FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adverse event]]s are further defined as “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.”&lt;ref name=Defs/&gt;

==Research==
Investigators in human clinical trials are obligated to report these events in clinical study reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Expert working group (efficacy) of the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use | title=Guideline for Industry Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports. | url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/iche3.pdf | format=PDF | date=August 25, 2007 | publisher=FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that these events are often inadequately reported in publicly available reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ioannidis JP, Lau J | title=Completeness of safety reporting in randomized trials: an evaluation of 7 medical areas. | journal=JAMA | year=2001 | volume=285 | pages=437–43 | pmid=11242428| doi=10.1001/jama.285.4.437 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of these data and uncertainty about methods for synthesising them, individuals conducting [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions often unknowingly overemphasise health benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou R, Helfand M | title=Challenges in systematic reviews that assess treatment harms. | journal=Ann Intern Med | year=2005 | volume=142 | pages=1090–0 | pmid=15968034 | issue=12 Pt 2 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-142-12_part_2-200506211-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To balance the overemphasis on benefit, scholars have called for more complete reporting of harm from clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ioannidis JP, Evans SJ, Gøtzsche PC, O'Neill RT, Altman DG, Schulz K, Moher D, ((CONSORT Group)) | author3-link=Peter C.

==Related Terms==
Serious adverse reactions are serious adverse events judged to be related to drug therapy.  A SUSAR (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction) should be reported to a drug regulatory authority under an investigational license by using the [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences|CIOMS]] form (or in some countries an equivalent form).  "Unexpected" means that for an authorised (approved) medicinal product that the event is not described in the product's labeling, or in the case of an investigational (unapproved) product that the event is not listed in the [[Investigator's Brochure|Investigator’s Brochure]].

An [[adverse effect]] is an adverse event which is believed to be caused by a health intervention.

The '''Sexual Health Resource Centre''' (SHRC) is a non-profit information and referral service that addresses [[sex]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[sexual health]].  It serves the community of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and is located in the John Deutsch University Centre of [[Queen’s University]].  It is operated by volunteers year round who respond to inquiries by phone or in person.  It is funded by student fees from the [[Alma Mater Society of Queen's University|Alma Mater Society]] and Society of Graduate and Professional Students at Queen’s University.

==History==
Dr. Jim Whitley, a math professor and assistant to the Principal, helped spearhead a student project in 1971 called the Birth Control and Abortion Information and Referral Centre, which was also staffed by full-time coordinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Centre gets grant  | newspaper = Kingston Whig Standard   | date = March 7, 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the initial goals of the Centre was to provide information on “birth control, abortion, infertility, vasectomies and veneral disease, and medical referrals.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Sex information groups join forces| newspaper = Kingston Whig Standard   | date = June 15, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1974, its expanding mandate led to a name change to the Birth Control, VD &amp; Abortion Referral Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = The B. C. Centre  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1974–1975  | page = 135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Centre moved to the Grey House at 51 Bader Lane in 1975 and established a lending library.  The name was again changed to the shorter “Birth Control Centre” in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Birth Control| place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Student Services  | year = 1983–1984  | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Centre began selling sexual health products at cost with the introduction of spermicidal foam and condom wallets in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Health Services  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1987–1988 | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Queen’s Birth Control Centre to hand out ‘condom wallets’  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1988–1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This selection expanded by 1991 to include spermicidal jelly and sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Queen’s and Community Services  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1991–1992  | page = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the Centre was again renamed as the “(Not Just the) Birth Control Centre” in recognition of its growing mandate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Student-Run Services | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1995–1996| page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was again promptly changed to the Sexual Health Resource Centre, which it remains today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Services  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1996–1997| page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, theSHRC began receiving direct funding from Queen’s University undergraduate students through the establishment of a mandatory $0.85 CAD fee per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Referendum Statements   | newspaper = Queen’s Journal  | date = January 30, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fee withstood a challenge that it discriminated against students on the basis of religion that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Daifallah  | first = Adam  | title = Student bravely challenges pro-abort funding  | newspaper = The Interim  | date = December 2004  | url = http://www.theinterim.com/2004/dec/13student.html  | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The SHRC is an educational resource to the community it serves.  It has its own lending library, separate from the Queen’s University library, and has a diverse selection of pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://queensjournal.ca/story/2008-02-12/supplement/making-us-happier-sexual-citizens/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901174708/http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2008-02-12/supplement/making-us-happier-sexual-citizens/ |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SHRC volunteers have also offered educational teach-in sessions for audiences ranging from elementary school to university students and other community groups since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Tomlinson  | first = Jeremy  | title = Prejudices hinder Student Affairs Centre  | newspaper = Queen’s Journal  | pages = 16  | date = February 7, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach-ins cover a range of topics from healthy relationships, [[contraception]], [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], and sex toys.

The SHRC also sells an assortment of sexual health and pleasure products at cost.  The Centre began selling products in 1987, beginning with spermicidal foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Health Services  | place = Queen’s University  | publisher = Alma Mater Society  | series = Who’s Where   | year = 1987–1988 | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contraceptive and protective methods currently sold include a variety of [[condom]]s, [[dental dam]]s, and [[female condom|reality condoms]] (aka female condoms). The SHRC has also sold sex toys at cost since 2001, such as [[dildo]]s, masturbatory sleeves, [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]], and [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] play items.

The SHRC also regularly collaborates with community groups in Kingston with a similar mandate, such as HIV/AIDS Regional Services, ReelOut Queer Film Festival, and Sexual Assault Centre Kingston.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4776">'''Stand Up and Take Action''' is the name of an annual global mobilization coordinated by the [[United Nations Millennium Campaign]] and the [[Global Call to Action against Poverty]].

==Background==
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Summit}}
In 2000, leaders of 189 countries assembled in [[New York City]] to outline a series of targets to address the most serious challenges in the developing world. The MDGs are an eight-point road map with measurable targets and clear deadlines for improving the lives of the world's poorest people. World leaders have agreed to achieve the MDGs by 2015.

==Organizer==
{{Main|United Nations Millennium Campaign}}
The Stand Up is organized by the United Nations Millennium Campaign. The United Nations Millennium Campaign is a UNDP campaign unit in response to the Millennium Declaration signed by 189 member states. Established in October, 2002, it aims to increase support to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and seek a coalition of partners for action. The Millennium Campaign targets intergovernmental, government, civil society organizations and media at both global and regional levels.

==Participation==
The forms of participation vary.

Common ways to make noise for MDG include:
* Public gatherings banging spoons on metal plates to illustrate hunger
* Church groups and temples arranging the bells to be rung at the same time in cities across the country
* Local musicians playing their instruments in innovative locations.

United Nations Millennium Campaign encourages the participants to record the events and inform the Campaign about the details to measure the level of support and increase the political impact.

==History==
=== 2006 ===
On 15–16 October 2006, 23,542,614 people, in over eighty countries around the world set a new [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest number of people to "STAND UP AGAINST POVERTY". In [[Asia]], 18,195,126 people took the pledge for poverty eradication. The Stand Up record attempt was an initiative of the [[Millennium Campaign]] in partnership with the Global Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP), set in time for the [[United Nations International Day for Poverty Eradication]] on 17 October 2006.

===2007===
More than 43.7 million people in 127 countries participated in the second Stand Up in 2007.

===2008===
From October 17–19, more than 116 million people took part in the third Stand Up. The three days of action saw huge concerts in [[Lagos]], [[Singapore]], [[Togo]], [[Manila]] and [[Nairobi]]. From [[Pretoria]], [[Harare]] and [[Delhi]], there were vast campaign marches and mass mobilizations.

Other events included a countrywide caravan rally in Togo focusing on specific MDG goals, hundreds of mosques "standing up" in a statement of solidarity and, in [[Indonesia]], a ‘Stand Up and Take Action’ Rap Contest for community youth groups in Manila.

In [[Belgium]]. there was a football event mass campaign while, in [[Germany]], [[Bianca Jagger]] presented video messages from members of the [[World Future Council]].

Schools across the world also took part from [[Malta]] to [[Palestinian Authority]], where 500,000 pupils organized debates. There were cinema screenings, mass signings, marches, and ant-poverty actions across the globe.

===2009 "Stand Up and Take Action against Poverty" campaign ===
173 million people, 2.5% of the world population, around the world took part in the fourth Stand Up.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, ''Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the organization'', General Assembly Official Records Sixty-fourth Session Supplement No. 1, United Nations, 4 August 2009, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; This was a new Guinness World Record. Over 3,000 events were held in more than 120 countries in the fourth year of the “Stand Up, Take Action, End Poverty Now!” campaign over the weekend. At least 100 million people in Asia took part in the campaign, while [[Africa]] saw the participation of almost 40 million, the [[Arab region]] over 30 million, [[Europe]] more than 2 million, [[Latin America]] and [[North America]] some 200,000 each, and [[Oceania]] more than 170,000.

===2010===
Stand Up 2010 took place on September 17 to 19. The theme is “Make a Noise for the MDGs”. A global day of action will take place on September 18. This is designed to ensure that the support of the MDGs is seen and heard around the world prior to the UN MDG Review Summit taking place in [[New York City]] from September 20 to 22.

A '''stressor''' is a chemical or [[biological agent]], [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] condition, [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimulus]] or an event that causes [[Stress (biology)|stress]] to an [[biological organism|organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sato|first1=Tadatoshi|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Hironori|last3=Sawada|first3=Naoki|last4=Nashiki|first4=Kunitaka|last5=Tsuji|first5=Mitsuyoshi|last6=Muto|first6=Kazusa|last7=Kume|first7=Hisae|last8=Sasaki|first8=Hajime|last9=Arai|first9=Hidekazu|last10=Nikawa|first10=Takeshi|last11=Taketani|first11=Yutaka|last12=Takeda|first12=Eiji|title=Restraint stress alters the duodenal expression of genes important for lipid metabolism in rat|journal=Toxicology|date=October 2006|volume=227|issue=3|pages=248–261|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2006.08.009|pmid=16962226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologically speaking, a stressors can be events or environments that an individual would consider demanding, challenging, and or threaten the individual's safety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Deckers, Lambert (2018). Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental. New York, NY: Routledge. pp. 208-

212. &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 978-1-138-03632-1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

An event that triggers the [[stress response]] may include:
* environmental stressors ([[:en:Hypothermia|hypo]] or [[:en:Hyperthermia|hyper]]-thermic [[:en:Thermoregulation|temperatures]], [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]], [[over-illumination]], [[overcrowding]])
* daily stress events (e.g., [[traffic]], lost keys, money, quality and quantity of physical activity)
* life changes (e.g., [[divorce]], bereavement)
* workplace stressors (e.g., high job demand vs. low job control, repeated or sustained exertions, forceful exertions, extreme postures)
* chemical stressors (e.g., [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], drugs{{Specify |reason=Please provide specific examples. |date=March 2018}})
* social stressor (e.g., societal and family demands)

Stressors have physical, chemical and mental responses inside of the body. Physical stressors produce mechanical stresses on skin, bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves that cause tissue deformation and in extreme cases tissue failure.  Chemical stresses also produce biomechanical responses associated with [[metabolism]] and tissue repair. Physical stressors may produce pain and impair work performance.  Chronic pain and impairment requiring medical attention may result from extreme physical stressors or if there is not sufficient recovery time between successive exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace: Low Back and Upper Extremities. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press|year=2001|publisher=National Academey Press|isbn=0-309-07284-0|pages=512|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders: Report, Workshop Summary, and Workshop Papers|year=199|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=0-309-06397-3|pages=240|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=6431d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors may also affect mental function and performance. One possible mechanism involves stimulation of the [[hypothalamus]], CRF ([[corticotropin release factor]]) -&gt; [[pituitary gland]] releases ACTH ([[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]) -&gt; [[adrenal cortex]] secretes various stress hormones (e.g., [[cortisol]]) -&gt; [[stress hormone]]s (30 varieties) travel in the blood stream to relevant [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], e.g., [[glands]], [[heart]], [[intestines]] -&gt; [[flight-or-fight response]]. Between this flow there is an alternate path that can be taken after the stressor is transferred to the [[hypothalamus]], which leads to the sympathetic [[nervous system]]. After which, the [[adrenal medulla]] secretes [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Stress?|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/stress/revise-it/what-is-stress|publisher=S-Cool}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental and social stressors may affect behavior and how individuals respond to physical and chemical stressors.

Life requires everyone to make sudden and planned adjustments to meet its demands, but the greater the demand comes with a greater adjustment and possibly more stress. Determining the impact of these various stressors allow individuals to decide the relationship between the types of stressors and the degree of distress. Identifying the stressor-stress relationship must involve quantifying the impact of life demands and all stress spurred from it. To do this, subjective measures and objective measures will be used depending on the situation. Individuals determine the degree of adjustment themselves in subjective measures, but a degree of adjustment will be or has already been assigned to the individual in an objective measure. The degrees of adjustment are measured by life change units, where one unit equals a degree of adjustment necessary to cope with the life change. The practice of measuring life change units led to the creation of many scales composed of these units that are tailored to certain life events or situations, such as social readjustment and college students &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 215&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	Once the relationship between the stressor (event) and the stress, the individual can then begin to focus on the stress magnitude and the stress itself. For life events with a lower magnitude of impact, the ability to cope and adjust may not be very complex and relatively brief. But for others, life events with high magnitudes can impact their lives in many ways for an extended amount of time. The various stressors listed above can all have events or stressors that range anywhere from minor to traumatic. Traumatic events are very debilitating stressors, and often times these stressors are uncontrollable. Traumatic events can deplete an individual’s coping resources to an extent where the individual may develop acute stress disorder or even post-traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is a psychological disorder where a traumatic event that is life threatening or threatens an injury causes a reaction of fear and helplessness lasting up to four weeks. Post-traumatic stress disorder has symptoms of lasting longer than one month, and the first symptom is a history of experiencing a traumatic event followed with a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one of these ways: recurrent distressing recollections, dreams, flashbacks, illusions, or a sense of reliving the experience, and distress or physical arousal by reminders of this event. The individual suffers from a persistent avoidance of reminders of the event. People who have been abused, victimized, or terrorized are often more susceptible to stress disorders &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 216&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nevid, Spencer, and Greene, et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	No matter the magnitude of the stressor and stress, most stressor-stress relationships can be evaluated and determined by either the individual or a psychologist. Without proper attention, stress can produce severe effects on mental health and the immune system, which can eventually lead to effects on the physical body. Therapeutic measures are often taken to help replenish and rebuild the individual’s coping resources while simultaneously aiding the individual in dealing with the current stressor. 

'''Psychological Stressors''' 

Stressors occur when an individual is unable to cope with the demands of their environment (such as crippling debt with no clear path to resolving it).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, stressors take many forms, such as: traumatic events, life demands, sudden medical emergencies, and daily inconveniences, to name a few. There are also a variety of characteristics that a stressor may possess (different durations, intensity, predictability, and controllability).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Predictability and Controllability'''

When individuals are informed about events before they occur, the magnitude of the stressor is less than when compared to individuals who were not informed of the stressor.&lt;ref&gt;Grillon, C., Baas, J. P., Lissen, S., Smith, K., &amp; Milstein, J. (2004). Anxious responses to predictable and unpredictable aversive events. Behavioral Neuroscience, 2004, 118, 916-924.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual would prefer to know when they have a deadline ahead of time in order to prepare for it in advance, rather than find out about the deadline the day of. In knowing that there is a deadline ahead of time, the intensity of the stressor is smaller for the individual, as opposed to the magnitude of intensity for the other unfortunate individual who found out about the deadline the day of. When this was tested, psychologists found that when given the choice, individuals had a preference for the predictable stressors, rather than the unpredictable stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Lejuez, C. W., Eifert, G. H., Zvolensky, M. J., &amp; Richards, J. B. (2000). Preference between onset predictable and unpredictable administrations of 20 percent carbon-dioxide-enriched air: Implications for better understanding the etiology and treatment of panic disorder. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 349-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the degree to which the stressor can be controlled plays a variable in how the individual perceives stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has found that if an individual is able to take some control over the stressor, then the level of stress will be decreased. During this study, it was found that the individuals become increasingly anxious and distressed if they were unable to control their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Zvolensky M. J., Eifert, G. H., &amp; Lejuez, C. W. (2001). Offset control during recurrent 20 percent carbon-dioxide- enriched air induction: Relation to individual difference variables. Emotion, 1, 148-165.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, imagine an individual who detests baths in the Middle Ages, taking a bath. If the individual was forced to take the bath with no control over the temperature of the bath (one of the variables), then their anxiety and stress levels would be higher than if the individual was given some control over the environment (such as being able to control the temperature of the water).

Based on these two principles (predictability and control), there are two hypotheses that attempt to account for these preferences; the preparatory response hypothesis and safety hypothesis attempt to accommodate these preferences.

'''Preparatory Response Hypothesis'''

The idea behind this hypothesis is that an organism can better prepare for an event if they are informed beforehand, as this allows them to prepare for it (biologically).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In biologically preparing for this event beforehand, the individual is able to better decrease the event's aversiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, C. C. (1955). The stimulus conditions which follow learned responses. Psychological Review, 62, 341-348.&lt;/ref&gt; In knowing when a potential stressor will occur (such as an exam), the individual could, in theory, prepare for it in advance, thus decreasing the stress that may result from that event.

'''Safety Hypothesis'''

In this hypothesis, there are two time periods, one in which is deemed safe (where there is no stressor), and one which is deemed unsafe (in which the stressor is present).&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. (1971). Phobias and preparedness. Behavior Therapy, 2, 207-320.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to procrastination and cramming; during the safe intervals (weeks before an exam) the individual is relaxed and not anxious, and during the unsafe intervals (the day or night before the exam) the individual most likely experiences stress and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sulemanki Headworks''' is a [[headworks]] on the [[River Sutlej]] near Okara, in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]].

Sulemanki Headworks is used for irrigation and flood control.

Sulemanki Headworks is part of the Sutlej Valley Project completed between 1922-1927 at the behest of the Nawab of Bahawalpur, Amir Sadiq Mohammed Khan V and the British Government. It was an irrigation scheme to develop the neighbouring areas. http://www.bahawalnagar.net/History.aspx

More specifically, the construction of the Pakpattan Canal took place in British Punjab in 1925 to on the right bank of the Sulemanki Headworks. This was undertaken to develop the Nilli bar colony in the south of Punjab.

This headworks is located about a mile from the Indian border on the Sutlej River. From here originate three major canals which supply irrigation water to a large area in Southern Punjab and the Bahawalnagar district. The Upper Pakpattan Canal arises from its right bank and two canals arise from the left. The canals on the left bank are Fordwah and Eastern Sadiqia Canal. The later canal runs along the Pakistan-India border. After 46 miles at Jalwala headworks, Eastern Sadiqia Canal trifurcates into Sirajwah distributary, Malik Branch Canal and Hakara Branch Canal. Hakara branch runs in a southwesterly direction for another 75 miles and is at few places it is a few meters from the Indian border. According to Pakistan army it provides a major defensive landmark against any possible Indian intrusion. Therefore, it is of a significant strategic importance. http://vatsrohit.blogspot.com/2012/08/pakistan-defensive-canals-in-south.html

About ten miles upriver from the Sulemanki Headworks the Baloki-Sulemanki Link Canal has its outfall connecting the Ravi River to the Sutlej River and thus offsetting the loss of water to India as agreed upon in Indus Basin Water Treaty of 1960. According to that treaty, three Eastern rivers, Ravi, Sutlej and Beas are allocated for the exclusive use of India before they enter Pakistan.

In accordance with the popularity of Retreat Ceremony at other Indo-Pakistan border crossings such as at Wagah and Hussainiwala near Lahore, a smaller ceremony also takes place here at the check point Sadki by Pakistan Rangers and Indian Border Security Force. It attracts a sizable number of tourists on both sides. http://pakarmedforces.com/2013/12/major-shabbir-sharif-6-december-1971.html

In fact the small hilltop Pakistani check point of Sadki was transferred to the Pakistani control by India by a treaty signed on January 17, 1961. Pakistan  needed to have border adjustments for efficient operation of the Headworks which was not possible otherwise. In return Pakistan ceded a part of its territory to India. That territory in itself is noteworthy for the memorial constructed in memory of Bhaghat Singh, a freedom fighter who was executed by the colonial British government.

Major [[Shabbir Sharif]], a Pakistani officer, the elder brother of General [[Raheel Sharif]], former [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Pakistan Army Staff]] was myrtyred in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] in this border region. He was posthumously awarded Nishan-Haider the highest Pakistani military honor for bravery.

==Life and family==
The son of Dr John Penhall [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] [[Society of Apothecaries|LSA]] (born 1833 at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]], [[Middlesex]], in 1871 a [[general practitioner]] in [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]]),&lt;ref&gt;1871 census transcript for Hastings, Sussex, at rootsuk.com, accessed 17 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Penhall was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PNL877W|name=Penhall, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spost&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=206813 William Penhall...] at summitpost.org, accessed 17 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Census in the United Kingdom|1881 census]], he was enumerated at Trinity, giving his place of birth as Hastings, Sussex, and his occupation as "No Occ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/Census/household_record.asp?HOUSEHOLD_CODE=1881BR_1707023&amp;HOUSEHOLD_SUB=1&amp;frompage=99 Trinity College] [[Trinity Street, Cambridge|Trinity Street]], UK census 1881, online at familysearch.org, accessed 17 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alpinism==

===First ascents===
Penhall made the [[first ascent]] of a number of peaks and routes in the [[Alps]] during the [[silver age of alpinism]].

Together with [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Martin Conway]], G. S. Scriven and guides Ferdinand Imseng and Peter and M. Truffer he made the first ascent (in two and a half hours) of the west face of the [[Zinalrothorn]] in August 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Dumler and Willi P. Burkhardt, ''The High Mountains of the Alps'', London: Diadem, 1994, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Albert Frederick Mummery]] and guides [[Alexander Burgener]] and Ferdinand Imseng he made the first ascent of the [[Dürrenhorn]] on 7 September 1879.&lt;ref&gt;''The High Mountains of the Alps'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Penhall was involved in a race with Mummery to be the first to climb the Zmutt ridge of the [[Matterhorn]], a race which Mummery eventually won. According to Penhall, his interest in finding a new way up the mountain had been kindled by [[Edward Whymper]]'s account of the successful first ascent in 1865 in ''Scrambles amongst the Alps''.&lt;ref&gt;William Penhall, 'The Matterhorn from the Zmutt Glacier', ''Alpine Journal'', Vol. IX, reprinted in ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'', ed. Walt Unsworth, London: Allen Lane, 1981, pp. 64–72.&lt;/ref&gt; As Mummery and Burgener approached the mountain to attempt the ridge they met Penhall, and guides Ferdinand Imseng and Louis Zurbrücken, who had retreated from the mountain after a bad-weather bivouac on the ridge. After a brief rest in [[Zermatt]], Penhall returned to the Matterhorn, making the first ascent of the its west face on 3 September 1879, a harder climb than the Zmutt ridge; his party reached the summit one hour after Mummery's.&lt;ref&gt;''The High Mountains of the Alps'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Penhall wrote an account of the west face climb in the [[Alpine Journal]] entitled 'The Matterhorn from the Zmutt Glacier'. The Penhall Couloir on the west face is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Robin G. Collomb, ''Pennine Alps Central'', London: Alpine Club, 1975, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Penhall and [[Meiringen]] guide Andreas Maurer were killed by an avalanche high up on the [[Wetterhorn]] on 3 August 1882. Penhall and Maurer share a double gravestone in the [[Grindelwald]] cemetery.&lt;ref name=spost/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gos|first=Charles|title=Alpine Tragedy|chapter=Mysterious Disasters II.

'''ZAMBART Project''' is a [[public health]] research [[non-governmental organization]] conducting scientific research into the dual epidemics of [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV]]. The organization is based in [[Lusaka, Zambia]] at the [[University of Zambia]]'s School of Medicine Ridgeway Campus. ZAMBART has over 200 employees and works in 16 study sites throughout the country.

==Overview==
The Zambia AIDS Related Tuberculosis (ZAMBART) Project is a Zambian NGO formed in 2004 from a collaboration between the University of Zambia’s School of Medicine and the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] that spans more than 20 years. From the initial studies of the impact of HIV on the clinical presentation and outcome of tuberculosis, the scope and partnership of the research have expanded widely. Based in [[Lusaka]], ZAMBART now collaborates closely with government, non-governmental and academic institutions within Zambia, Africa and the rest of the world. ZAMBART staff form an interdisciplinary team with a range of expertise including [[epidemiology]], clinical science, [[social science]], [[laboratory]], operations research, health systems and services research, health policy analysis, [[health economics]], [[development communication]] and counselling.

ZAMBART focuses on the overlap between HIV and TB in order to improve the quality of life of people affected by the dual epidemic. Conducting research within a limited resource setting, ZAMBART is committed to: bridging research and action through operational research and through forging effective collaboration with local stakeholders; providing evidence-based and high quality research; addressing relevant scientific and priority questions; and [[capacity building]] for Zambian [[research]] - both scientific and managerial.

Internationally, ZAMBART is recognised as one of the foremost TB/HIV research groups in the world. Representatives sit on the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] TB/HIV working group and have assisted in the writing of WHO technical guidelines and [[policy]] documents. In addition, ZAMBART is actively involved in regional and international research consortia through TARGETS [http://targets.lshtm.ac.uk/], Evidence for Action [http://www.evidence4action.org/] and the Consortium to Respond Effectively to the AIDS/TB Epidemic (CREATE)[http://www.tbhiv-create.org/home].

ZAMBART has no core funding but has been successful in attracting grants from a wide range of sources. Much of the current portfolio of activity is funded through the Department For International Development (DFID)  Knowledge Programmes on Tuberculosis (TARGETS) and HIV (Evidence for Action) and the CREATE Consortium, funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].
