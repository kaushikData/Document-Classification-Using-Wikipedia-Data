'''Appellate jurisdiction''' is the power of a higher  court to review decisions and change outcomes of decisions of lower courts. Most appellate jurisdiction is legislatively created, and may consist of appeals by leave of the appellate court or by right. Depending on the type of case and the decision below, appellate review primarily consists of: an entirely new hearing (a non trial de novo); a hearing where the appellate court gives deference to factual findings of the lower court; or review of particular legal rulings made by the lower court (an appeal on the record).

==The courts of the United States==

Under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], the judicial power of the United States is vested in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and the inferior courts established by law. The [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] govern appellate proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/appel2007.pdf Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013917/http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/appel2007.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard of review ==
Under its standard of review, an appellate court decides the extent of the deference it would give to the lower court's decision, based on whether the appeal was one of fact or one of law.

In reviewing an issue of fact, an appellate court ordinarily gives deference to the trial court's findings. It is the duty of trial judges or [[jury|juries]] to find facts, view the evidence firsthand, and observe witness testimony.  When reviewing lower decisions on an issue of fact, courts of appeal generally look for '''''clear error'''''.

The appellate court reviews issues of law '''''de novo''''' (anew, no deference) and may reverse or modify the lower court's decision if the appellate court believes the lower court misapplied the facts or the law.

An appellate court may also review the lower judge's discretionary decisions, such as whether the judge properly granted a new trial or disallowed evidence. The lower court's decision is only changed in cases of an "abuse of discretion". This standard tends to be even more deferential than the "clear error" standard.

Before hearing any case, the Court must have jurisdiction to consider the appeal.

'''''Astley v Verdun''''', 2011 ONSC 3651, is a leading [[Canadian defamation law|defamation]] decision released by [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]]. The case was publicized for the amount of [[damages]] awarded to the [[plaintiff]], and the permanent  [[injunction]] ordered against the [[defendant]].

==Background==
[[Robert Astley]] was the CEO and President of [[Clarica Life Assurance]] (formerly ''Mutual Life of Canada'') from 1993 to 2002.  In 2002, Astley became the President of [[Sun Life Financial]] and oversaw the merger of Clarica and Sun Life. In 2004, Astley retired and became a director of the [[Bank of Montreal]] and the [[CPP Investment Board|Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board]] (CPPIB).  In 2008, Astley was appointed as Chairperson of the CPPIB.&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

[[J Robert Verdun]] was former newspaper publisher who was known for his controversial editorials. He frequently appeared at [[annual general meeting|general shareholder meetings]] for public corporations to demand higher accountability to [[shareholders]].&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;

In December 2004, Verdun wrote an email to the Bank of Montreal chairperson to complain about Astley's appointment to the board. Verdun described Astley as "unethical, greedy, and narrowly-focused". At a later Bank of Montreal shareholder meeting, Verdun publicly called Astley a "stain on this board" and that Astley had no integrity or ethics.&lt;ref name="LawTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Landmark ruling in libel suit |author=Michael McKiernan |url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/201105308471/Headline-News/Landmark-ruling-in-libel-suit |newspaper=LawTimes |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804074152/http://www.lawtimesnews.com/201105308471/Headline-News/Landmark-ruling-in-libel-suit |archivedate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Verdun filed a shareholders proposal with several banks that further defamed Astley.&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;

Astley's lawyers wrote to Verdun to warn him to stop defaming Astley. Instead, Verdun wrote to the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] to complain that Astley lacked the integrity to serve as director, and released the letter to the media.&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision"&gt;''Astley v Verdun'', [https://archive.is/20130115072643/http://www.canlii.ca/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc3651/2011onsc3651.html 2011 ONSC 3651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;

Over the years, Verdun publicly called Astley "unethical", "corrupt", "dishonest", "a petty operator", "lacking in integrity", and "motivated by greed".&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

Verdun later wrote a book, [[The Fox in Charge of the Biggest Henhouse in Canada]], which further defamed Astley.  As a result, [[#Injunction|the book is not available in Canada]].

The trial judge would later describe Verdun's actions as being motivated by malice.&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

In May 2006, Astley filed a statement of claim against Verdun, suing him for defamation.&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt; According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' such defamation lawsuits are rare "''because companies and their top brass don't want to look as if they're muzzling small shareholders.''" [[shareholder]]s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.investorvoice.ca/PI/2731.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing==

===Counterclaim===

Following Astley's filing of the statement of claim, various major newspapers reported on the case. Verdun claimed that Astley had provided the newspapers with a copy of the statement of claim in order to defame Verdun, and filed a [[counterclaim]], suing Astley for defamation.&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SummaryJudgement"&gt;''Astley v. Verdun'', [https://archive.is/20130115073437/http://www.canlii.ca/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii19204/2008canlii19204.html 2008 CanLII 19204] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2008, the counterclaim was [[summary judgment|summarily dismissed]] for lack of compliance with the ''[[Libel and Slander Act (Ontario)|Libel and Slander Act]]'', which restricts lawsuits based on [[libel]] in a newspaper unless the plaintiff makes a complaint in writing within six weeks of plaintiff becoming aware of the alleged libel. Although notice is not an absolute requirement, the court found that there were no justified reasons for non-compliance.&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SummaryJudgement" /&gt;

On October 21, 2008, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] dismissed Verdun's appeal. On March 5, 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] refused leave to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Astley v Verdun'', [https://archive.is/20120722035319/http://www.canlii.ca/en/on/onca/doc/2008/2008onca728/2008onca728.html 2008 ONCA 728]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Verdun v. Astley'', [https://archive.is/20120722113025/http://www.canlii.ca/en/ca/scc-l/doc/2009/2009canlii8840/2009canlii8840.html 2009 CanLII 8840] (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witnesses for the  Plaintiff===
* [[Robert Prichard]], President and [[CEO]] of [[Torstar Corporation]] and Dean and President of the [[University of Toronto]]
* [[David Ganong]], [[Chairperson]] of the Board of [[Mutual Life]] in 1999 and later, [[Clarica Life Assurance]] for three years who worked closely with Mr. [[robert Astley|Astley]]
* [[David A. Galloway|David Galloway]], [[CEO]] of [[Torstar]] until 2002 and now [[Chair]] of the Board at [[Bank of Montreal]].
&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

===Defendant self represented===

[[Robert Verdun]] was [[self represented]], and did not call any witnesses.&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

== Jury decision and damages==

On May 20, 2011, a jury found that all eight statements by Verdun that Astley complained of were defamatory, and that Verdun had acted with [[Malice (law)|malice]]. These statements included the emails to the Bank of Montreal board, the letter to the Ontario Securities Commission, the public statements made at the shareholder meetings, and the statements made in the shareholder proposals. The jury rejected the defences of [[qualified privilege]] and [[Canadian defamation law|responsible communication]].&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;

The jury awarded damages against Verdun in the amount of $650,000, including $400,000 in aggravated damages. This is considered to be one of the largest amounts of aggravated damages for a defamation case in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="LawTimes" /&gt;

==Injunction==

On June 6, 2011, the court ordered a permanent injunction against Verdun. The order was:&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt;

{{quote box|I order a permanent injunction to issue against the defendant, J. Robert Verdun, restraining him from disseminating, posting on the Internet or publishing, in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, any statements or comments about the plaintiff, Robert M. Astley. This injunction shall include the publication, circulation and promotion of the book entitled "The Fox In Charge…" and any similar or other publications. For further particularity, the defendant shall not publish or cause to be published or otherwise disseminate or distribute in any manner whatsoever, whether by way of the Internet or other medium, any statements or other communications which refer to Robert Astley by name, depiction or description.|align=center|width=50%|source=Justice [[Sandra Chapnik]], Ontario Superior Court of Justice}}

In doing so, the judge found:
*Verdun intended to continue defaming Astley, even after the jury's decision, including publishing his book.
*There was a very real possibility that Verdun would not pay the damages to Astley (and in fact, two prior costs orders against Verdun were still outstanding).

The judge agreed that restraining Verdun's freedom of speech should only be done in the clearest and rarest of cases.  However, the judge went on to find that this was one of those cases.&lt;ref name="InjunctionDecision" /&gt; Verdun was later found guilty of contempt of the 2011 order, deliberately breaching the order without justification, excuse, or defence to the allegation of contempt of court.&lt;ref&gt;''Verdun v. Astley'', [https://archive.is/20131015072647/http://canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2013/2013onsc2998/2013onsc2998.html] ONSC&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abdulhadi Alkhawaja.jpg|thumb|[[Abdulhadi al-Khawaja]] is widely regarded as the most prominent in the group.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Gardner (journalist)|Frank Gardner]] (2 May 2012). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17933393 "Meeting Bahrain's hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja"]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Bahrain Thirteen''' are thirteen [[Bahrain]]i opposition leaders, rights activists, bloggers and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] clerics arrested between 17 March and 9 April 2011 in connection with their role in the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|national uprising]]. In June 2011, they were tried by a special [[military court]], the [[National Safety Court]], and convicted of "setting up terror groups to topple the royal regime and change the constitution"; they received sentences ranging from two years to life in prison. A military appeal court upheld the sentences in September. The trial was "one of the most prominent" before the National Safety Court. A retrial in a civilian court was held in April 2012 but the accused were not released from prison. The sentences were upheld again on 4 September 2012. On 7 January 2013, the defendants lost their last chance of appeal when the Court of Cassation, Bahrain's top court upheld the sentences.

The thirteen are [[Abdulhadi al-Khawaja]], Abdulhadi al-Mukhodher, Abduljalil al-Miqdad, [[Abduljalil al-Singace]], Abdulla al-Mahroos, [[Abdulwahab Hussain]], [[Hasan Mushaima]], [[Ibrahim Sharif]], Mohamed Habib al-Miqdad, Mohamed Hasan Jawad, Mohamed Ismail, Sa’eed al-Nuri and Salah al-Khawaja. They were originally twenty-one, but seven were tried [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] and one was released in April 2012. The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts speculated that the government was concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government supporters who oppose any royal pardons.

The trial, conviction and sentencing of the Bahrain Thirteen drew expressions of concern from [[European Union]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]], and international organizations including the [[United Nations]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] and [[Human Rights First]]. The government of Bahrain maintained that trials were fair. The [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI)]], an independent inquiry commissioned by the [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King of Bahrain]], concluded in November 2011 that there had been a discernible pattern of mistreatment to the defendants while in prison.

'''The Birmingham Six''' were six men: Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker, who, in 1975, were each sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] following their false convictions for the  [[Birmingham pub bombings]]. Their convictions were declared [[miscarriage of justice|unsafe and unsatisfactory]] and quashed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Criminal Division|Court of Appeal]] on 14 March 1991. The six men were later awarded compensation ranging from [[Pound sterling|£]]840,000 to £1.2 million.

==Birmingham pub bombings==
The [[Birmingham pub bombings]] took place on 21 November 1974 and were attributed to the [[Provisional IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;Although the IRA denied that it was involved in the bombings two days after the event, and the IRA has never formally admitted responsibility for the Birmingham bomb, in 1985 a former IRA chief of staff, Joe Cahill, did acknowledge the IRA's role, and 30 years after the bombings [[Gerry Adams]], president of [[Sinn Féin]], expressed his regrets about the bombings and the huge loss of life and injuries they inflicted (Chrisafis, Angelique. [https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1356601,00.html IRA fails to say sorry for Birmingham pub bombs], ''[[The Guardian]]'' 22 November 2004, Staff. 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20041224123227/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/11/22/story492924770.asp Adams expresses regret for Birmingham pub bombings] ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' 22 November 2004).  [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10207331 Guardian newspaper: Birmingham Six man signs petition, 22 April 2012] - Patrick Hill, one of the Six, said in April 2012 that the Six had learned the names of the real bombers and claimed it was common knowledge among the upper echelons of both the IRA and the British government.&lt;/ref&gt; Explosive devices were placed in two central Birmingham pubs: the Mulberry Bush at the foot of the [[Rotunda (Birmingham)|Rotunda]], and the Tavern in the Town – a basement pub in [[New Street, Birmingham|New Street]]. The resulting explosions, at 20:25 and 20:27, collectively were the most injurious attacks in Great Britain since [[World War II]] (until surpassed by the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]); 21 people were killed (ten at the Mulberry Bush and eleven at the Tavern in the Town) and 182 people were injured. A third device, outside a bank in Hagley Road, failed to detonate.

===Arrests and questioning===
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--only one citation in this section--&gt;
Six men were arrested, of whom five were [[Belfast]]-born Roman Catholics, while John Walker was a Roman Catholic born in [[Derry]]. All six had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s. All the men except for Callaghan had left the city early on the evening of 21 November from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|New Street Station]], shortly before the explosions. They were travelling to Belfast to attend the funeral of a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] member who had accidentally killed himself while planting a bomb in [[Coventry]].

When they reached [[Heysham]] they and others were subject to a [[Special Branch]] [[stop and search]]. The men did not tell the police of the true purpose of their visit to Belfast, a fact that was later held against them. While the search was in progress the police were informed of the Birmingham bombings. The men agreed to be taken to [[Morecambe]] police station for [[forensic]] tests.

On the morning of 22 November, after the forensic tests and questioning at the hands of the Morecambe police, the men were transferred to the custody of [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] police unit. William Power alleged that he was assaulted by members of Birmingham [[Criminal Investigation Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/other/1974/faul76a.htm CAIN: Events: Birmingham Six: Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray. (n.d; 1975?) The Birmingham Framework: Six innocent men framed for the Birmingham Bombings], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 6 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Callaghan was taken into custody on the evening of 22 November.

While the men were in the custody of the West Midlands Police they were  deprived of food and sleep, they were interrogated sometimes for up to 12 hours without a break;  threats were made against them and the beatings  started: ranging from punches, letting dogs within a foot of them and being the subjects of a mock execution. Power confessed while in Morecambe while Callaghan, Walker and McIlkenny confessed at Queens Road in Aston; Hill and Hunter did not sign any documents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Trial===
On 12 May 1975 the six men were charged with murder and conspiracy to cause explosions. Three other men, James Kelly, [[Mick Murray (IRA volunteer)|Michael Murray]] and Michael Sheehan, were charged with conspiracy and Kelly and Sheehan also faced charges of unlawful possession of explosives.

The trial began on 9 June 1975 at the [[Crown Court of England and Wales|Crown Court]] sitting at [[Lancaster Castle]], before [[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Mr Justice Bridge]] and a jury. After legal arguments the statements made in November were deemed admissible as evidence. The unreliability of these statements was later established. [[Kenneth Littlejohn#Thomas Watt|Thomas Watt]]  provided [[circumstantial evidence]] about John Walker's association with Provisional IRA members.&lt;ref name=error&gt;p229 [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] ''Error of Judgement''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forensic scientist]] Dr [[Frank Skuse]] used positive [[Griess test]] results to claim that Hill and Power had handled explosives. Callaghan, Hunter, McIlkenny and Walker all had tested negative. [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GCMS]] tests at a later date were negative for Power and contradicted the initial results for Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aic.gov.au/conferences/medicine/schurr.pdf |title= Expert Witnesses And The Duties Of Disclosure &amp; Impartiality: The Lessons Of The IRA Cases In England. |accessdate=5 August 2007 |author= Beverley Schurr |authorlink= NSW Legal Aid Commission  |month= |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skuse's claim that he was 99% certain that Power and Hill had explosives traces on their hands was opposed by defence expert Dr Hugh Kenneth Black of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]], the former HM Chief Inspector of Explosives, Home Office. Skuse's evidence was clearly preferred by Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;R v McIlkenney (1991) 93 Cr.App.R. 287&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found the six men guilty of murder. On 15 August 1975, they were each sentenced to 21 life sentences.

===Criminal charges against prison officers and civil actions against police===
On 28 November 1974, the men appeared in court for the second time after they had been remanded into custody at [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|HM Prison Winson Green]]. All showed bruising and other signs of ill-treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulster.ac.uk/events/other/1974/faul76.htm CAIN: Events: Birmingham Six: Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray.

Conde Nast Publications Limited (Respondents)] UK Parliament publications Paragraph 86&lt;/ref&gt;

During proceedings, prison officers and police were blamed for the beatings.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Appeals===
In March 1976 their first application for leave to appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, presided over by [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]] [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|CJ]].&lt;ref&gt;''Miscarriages of Justice''; Bob Woffinden (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] investigated the case for [[Granada Television|Granada TV]]'s ''[[World in Action]]'' series. In 1985, the first of several ''World in Action'' programmes casting doubt on the men's convictions was broadcast. In 1986, Mullin's book, ''Error of Judgment: The Truth About the Birmingham Pub Bombings'', set out a detailed case supporting the men's claims that they were innocent. It included his claim to have met some of those who were actually responsible for the bombings.

The Home Secretary, [[Douglas Hurd]], referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. In January 1988, after a six-week hearing (at that time the longest criminal appeal hearing ever held), the convictions were ruled to be safe and satisfactory. The Court of Appeal, presided over by the Lord Chief Justice [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], dismissed the appeals. Over the next three years, newspaper articles, television documentaries and books brought forward new evidence to question the safety of the convictions, while campaign groups calling for the men's release were formed in [[Great Britain|Britain]], Ireland, Europe and the US.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Their second full appeal, in 1991, was allowed. Hunter was represented by [[Anthony Maurice Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], the others by [[Michael Mansfield]] QC. New evidence of police fabrication and [[suppression of evidence]], the successful attacks on both the confessions and the 1975 forensic evidence caused the Crown to decide not to resist the appeals. The Court of Appeal, constituted by Lord Justices Lloyd, Mustill and Farquharson, stated that "in the light of the fresh scientific evidence, which at least throws grave doubt on Dr. Skuse's evidence, if it does not destroy it altogether, these convictions are both unsafe and unsatisfactory." &lt;ref&gt;R v McIlkenney (1991) 93 Cr.App.R. 287–318.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 1991 the six walked free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peirce, Gareth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/12/gareth-peirce-birmingham-six |title=The Birmingham Six: Have we learned from our disgraceful past? |work=The Guardian |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a decade after their release, the six men were awarded compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/birmingham-six-40th-anniversary-of-pub-bombings-that-led-to-one-of-the-worst-miscarriages-of-british-justice-9874920.html "40th anniversary of pub bombings that led to one of the worst miscarriages of British justice"], ''The Independent'', 21 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard McIlkenny, one of the six men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings, died of cancer on 21 May 2006, aged 73. He had returned to Ireland shortly after he was freed from prison, and died in hospital with his family at his bedside.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/22/northernireland.sandralaville ''The Guardian'' 22 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; McIlkenny was buried on 24 May in [[Celbridge|Celbridge, County Kildare]]. Four other members of the Birmingham Six were present at his [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/birmingham-six-s-richard-mcilkenny-1.1007565 IrishTimes.com], 25 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five surviving members of the Birmingham Six, Patrick Hill currently resides in [[Ayrshire]]; Gerard Hunter in [[Portugal]]; John Walker in [[Donegal]]; and both Hugh Callaghan and William Power in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/birmingham-sixs-paddy-hill-life-1097054 ''Daily Record''], 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The success of the appeals and other miscarriages of justice caused the [[Home Secretary]] to set up a [[Royal Commission on Criminal Justice]] in 1991. The commission reported in 1993 and led to the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 which established the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] in 1997.  [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] George Reade and two other police officers were charged with [[perjury]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]] but were never prosecuted. During the inquest into the bombings in 2016, Hill stated that he knew the identities of three of the bombers who were still "free men" in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staunton|first1=Denis|title=Birmingham bombings: Coroner concerned tip-offs ignored|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/birmingham-bombings-coroner-concerned-tip-offs-ignored-1.2669215|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=15 January 2018|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Granada Television productions==
On 28 March 1990, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast the [[Granada Television]] [[docudrama|documentary drama]], ''Who Bombed Birmingham?'', which re-enacted the bombings and subsequent key events in [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]]'s campaign. Written by Rob Ritchie and directed by Mike Beckham, it starred [[John Hurt]] as Mullin, [[Martin Shaw]] as ''World in Action'' producer Ian McBride, [[Ciaran Hinds]] as Richard McIlkenny, one of the Six, and [[Patrick Malahide]] as [[Michael Mansfield]] (QC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/457900/index.html BFI Screenonline – World in Action]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Coward, Richard Down &amp; Christopher Perry ''The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955–2010'', Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, p.3304, {{ISBN|978-1-900203-33-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; It was repackaged for export as ''The Investigation – Inside a Terrorist Bombing'', and first shown on American television on 22 April 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/438102 – ''Who Bombed Birmingham?''] – British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099854/ – ''The Investigation: Inside a Terrorist Bombing''] – IMDB&lt;/ref&gt; Granada's [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-nominated follow-up documentary after the release of the six men, ''World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story'', was telecast on 18 March 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/456479 – ''World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story''] British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on DVD in 2007 in [[Network DVD]]'s first volume of ''World in Action'' productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=551 ''World in Action'' Volume 1], networkdvd.net; accessed 6 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Frank Skuse]] brought libel proceedings against Granada, contending that ''World in Action'' had falsely portrayed him as negligent. His counsel asserted in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] that scientific tests performed in 1992, after the Crown's substantive concession of the accused men's third appeal, showed that traces of nitroglycerine were detected on swabs taken after the bombings from the hands of Hunter and Hill, and on rail tickets handled by McIlkenny and Power. Granada maintained there were never any traces of explosives on the six men.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Mills [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scientist-in-birmingham-six-case-sues-tv-firm-for-libel-1440938.html "Scientist in Birmingham Six case sues TV firm for libel"], ''The Independent'', 5 October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Skuse abandoned the action in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pub-blasts-scientist-drops-libel-action-1443550.html "Pub blasts scientist drops libel action"], ''The Independent'', 18 October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of speech==
[[Channel 4]] was [[Injunction|enjoined]] in December 1987 by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] from re-enacting portions of a hearing in the court case because it was "likely to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice" if shown during their appeal, in violation of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Restricted Subjects: Freedom of Expression in the United Kingdom|author1=[[Helsinki Watch]]|author2=Fund for Free Expression|year=1991|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjvb0Y-iwqQC&amp;pg=PA53|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has been criticised for having a "[[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]]" on other programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Three Pillars of Liberty: Political Rights and Freedoms in the United Kingdom|last=Klug|first=Francesca|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=158–159|editor1-last=Starmer|editor1-first=Keir|editor2-last=Weir|editor2-first=Stuart|series=The Democratic Audit of the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0UMoZMrQh0C&amp;pg=PA159|isbn=978-041509642-3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association''''', 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a [[landmark case]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that struck down a 2005 [[California]] law banning the sale of certain violent [[video game]]s to children without parental supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/VSDA-v.-Schwarzenegger- |title=Schwarzenegger v.

The ruling was seen as a significant victory for the [[video game industry]]. Several of the Court's justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their continuously improving technology.

== Background ==
{{Main|Video game controversy#Crime and violence|l1=Connection between video games and crime and violence}}
Many video games, as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 game)|Death Race]]'',&lt;ref name="wired history"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/10/how-protests-ag/ | title = How Protests Against Games Cause Them To Sell More Copies | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = 2007-10-30 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605001253/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/10/how-protests-ag/ | archivedate = 2011-06-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate some aspect of violence into the gameplay mechanic, such as killing an enemy with a weapon, using explosives to destroy a structure, or engaging in dangerous vehicle races.  With modern technology, representations of such violence have become more realistic.  This has led to concerns that minors who play such video games will be influenced by the violence, altering their real-life behavior. Academic studies have attempted to find a connection between violent video games and the rate of violence and crimes from those that play them; some have stated a connection exists,&lt;ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour"&gt;Anderson, C.

Foti]]'' case that would have attempted to ban sales of violent video games from minors.

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|left|A typical ESRB rating label will identify the appropriate age group and specific content descriptors for each rated game.]]
To counteract these increasing complaints and attempts at legislation, the video game industry in the United States created the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | title = Game industry put focus on ratings years ago | first = Mike | last = Snider | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[USA Today]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702035618/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over the violence in the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | title = ESRB Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[ESRB]] | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103954/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | archivedate = 2011-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]], a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Evan Bayh]], would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | title = FTC Undercover Shopper Survey on Enforcement of Entertainment Ratings Finds Compliance Worst for Retailers of Music CDs and the Highest Among Video Game Sellers | date = 2011-04-20 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110817072723/http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | archivedate = 2011-08-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]].

== The California law ==
[[File:Leland Yee.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Former-California Senator [[Leland Yee]] introduced CA Law AB 1179, the law debated in the case.]]
In 2005, the [[California State Legislature]] passed AB 1179, sponsored by then-[[California State Senator]] [[Leland Yee]], which banned the sale of violent video games to anyone under age 18 and required clear labeling beyond the existing ESRB rating system.  The law would have a maximum $1000 fine for each infraction. The definition of "violent video game" used a variation of the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test used previously by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to define when [[obscene]] speech is not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

The law was a second attempt by Senator Yee to enact restrictions for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a [[child psychologist]] led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed that the government had strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | title = Lawmaker defends law banning sale of violent video games to minors | date = 2010-04-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | first = Ben | last = Fritz | work = Los Angeles Times | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031194737/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | archivedate = 2010-10-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles.

== Legal challenges ==

=== The District Court opinion ===
Before the California bill was signed into law, the ESA and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), now known as the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), were preparing a lawsuit to overturn the law, fearing that the "violent video game" definition would affect many titles that the ESRB has otherwise labeled appropriate for younger players, and threaten to harm the video game industry.&lt;ref name="gamespot signed" /&gt; The VSDA filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and was later joined by the ESA. The two groups succeeded in obtaining a preliminary injunction in December 2005 to block enforcement of the law during the case; U.S. District Judge [[Ronald M. Whyte]] cited in his preliminary decision: "The plaintiffs have shown at least that serious questions are raised concerning the States' ability to restrict minors' First Amendment rights in connection with exposure to violent video games, including the question of whether there is a causal connection between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children."&lt;ref name="arstech injunction"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | title = California game law blocked | first = Ken | last = Fisher | date = 2005-12-22 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100812143845/http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | archivedate = 2010-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Whyte ultimately ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the law violated the First Amendment, and that there was an insufficient showing of proof that either video games differed from other media or that there was established causality between violent video games and violent behavior.&lt;ref name="NDCalifDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v.

=== The Ninth Circuit appeal ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Then-Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] led the appeal of the lower courts' decisions.]] California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] appealed the ruling in September 2007, stating that he would "vigorously defend this law" and that he and the people of California have "a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultra-violent actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | title = Schwarzenegger To Appeal California Game Law Ruling | first = James | last = Dobson | date = 2007-08-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101111025315/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | archivedate = 2010-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed Whyte's decision in 2009.&lt;ref name="9thCirDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v. Schwarzenegger, et al. |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2008 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of the law; given the timeframe of the law's passing relative to litigation, it was referred to as the "Act" in the court's opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's Summary Judgment for the VSDA by holding:
#The Act is a presumptively invalid content-based restriction on speech, so it is subject to strict scrutiny and not the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York''.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ginsberg v. New York |vol=390 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=629 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1968 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/390/390.US.629.47.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act violates rights protected by the First Amendment because the state has not demonstrated a compelling interest, has not tailored the restriction to its alleged compelling interest, and there exists a less-restrictive means that would further the State's expressed interest.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2009 |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/20/0716620.pdf |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act's labeling requirement is unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment because it does not require the disclosure of purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court first addressed the VSDA's argument that the entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of "violent video game" in the Act is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute had a [[severability clause]]&lt;ref name="California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5"&gt;California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5.&lt;/ref&gt; so the court went through the severability test set forth in ''Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Superior Court |vol=35 |reporter=Cal. 4th |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2005 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the definition for "violent video game" is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of "violent video game," it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt; Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sonoma County Org.  of Pub. Employees v. County of Sonoma |vol=23 |reporter=Cal. 3d |opinion=296 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1979 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court next went on to determine what level of scrutiny should be applied in reviewing the Act's prohibitions. The defendants insisted that the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York'' should be used.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg" /&gt; However, the court held that the "variable obscenity" standard does not apply to violence. The Court in ''Ginsberg'' was careful to place substantive limits on its holding, and concern in ''Ginsberg'' regarded only "sex material," not violence. The court declined to extend the application of the "variable obscenity" standard to violence, so strict scrutiny was applied instead.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

In applying the strict scrutiny standard, the court recognized that "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid,"&lt;ref name="bulk.resource.org"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota |vol=505 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=377 |pinpoint=382 |court= |date=1992 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/505/505.US.377.90-7675.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to survive invalidation, the Act had to fulfill two qualifications:
#Restrictions "must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest."
#"If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. |vol=529 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=803 |pinpoint=813 |court= |date=2000 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/529/529.US.803.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invalidated the statute on both accounts. First, the court said that in considering its decision, the court limited the purpose of the Act to the actual harm to the brain of a child playing a violent video game. As a result, the state was required to show that "the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Turner Broad.

Second, the court held that the defendants did not demonstrate the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, video games already comply with a [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|voluntary rating system]] that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. The court noted that the least restrictive means is not the same as the most effective means.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a "violent video game." Generally, "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. |vol=547 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=47 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2006 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of "purely factual and uncontroversial information" in advertising.&lt;ref name="Zaruder v 2166"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Zaruder v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel |vol=471 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=626 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2985 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/471/471.US.626.83-2166.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labeling requirement of "violent video game" is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

=== Supreme Court appeal ===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice Antonin Scalia, along with those supporting the ESA side of the case, questioned whether violent video games should be treated differently from other media with similar violence regularly exposed to minors, such as the fairy tale of [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]
Gov. Schwarzenegger again appealed to the Supreme Court, looking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as ''Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2010-04-26-scotus-video-games_N.htm | title = High court takes video game case | work = [[USA Today]] | first = Joan | last = Biskupic | date = 2010-04-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104071903/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2010-04-26-scotus-video-games_N.htm | archivedate = 2010-11-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states.&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes nov02" /&gt; Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors.&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1up scotus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/news/supreme-court-review-california-violent | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150507185740/http://www.1up.com/news/supreme-court-review-california-violent | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-05-07 | title = Supreme Court to Review California's Violent Videogame Law | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = 2010-04-26 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just a week prior to the acceptance of the ''certiorari'', in ''[[United States v.

== Opinion ==
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion in the case.]]
On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 opinion striking down the California law as unconstitutional on the basis of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  It first held that "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": 

{{quote|Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world).  That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.}}

Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'' case, "speech about violence is not obscene," and California's statute was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | title = States May Not Ban Sale, Rental of Violent Videogames to Minors | first = David | last = Kravits | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629093204/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the [[Brothers Grimm]], which are regularly given to children to read, "contain no shortage of gore" that are also present in video games.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt; The decision further compared video games to classical works like ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', stating that "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society..., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."&lt;ref name="time decision"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | title = Supreme Court: 'Video Games Qualify for First Amendment Protection' | first = Evan | last = Narcisse | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183606/http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" requiring a law to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | title = 1st Amendment beats ban in video game battle | first = Stephen | last = Tolito | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118153215/http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no "compelling" link between violent video games and its effects on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gazJYGtwgygMOKo0UkFFbt2IQ41g?docId=CNG.8685d6a6040541cc62b1b2322b148bc7.681 | title = Top US court zaps violent videogame sales ban | work = [[Agence France-Presse]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' generate the same effects in children as in games like ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' or imagery of guns.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt;

=== Alito's concurrence ===
Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote a separate [[concurring opinion|concurrence]] supporting the majority decision, and was joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]]. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its "threshold requirement" that guides what material would be covered by the law was too broad, he questioned the potential [[double standard]] that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | title = Puritans and Lady Godiva: why two justices voted to uphold California's video game law | first = Nate | last = Anderson | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215548/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," referencing the book '' Infinite Reality '' which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: Alito Expresses Uncertainty About Violent Games' Effects | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702003152/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissents ===
Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] dissented, each authoring a separate dissent. Justice Thomas, in his dissent, considered that historically, the Founding Fathers "believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children," and that the intent of the First Amendment "does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: The Dissenters' Side | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115001/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision" /&gt;

Breyer wrote separately, concerned that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from ''Ginsberg'' and ''Miller''. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?"&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt; Breyer further argued that "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," and that "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20074680-281/u.s-supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-game-law/ | title = U.S. Supreme Court strikes down violent video game law | first =Declan | last = McCullagh | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 [[Federal Trade Commission]] study.&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
The ruling was praised by the video game industry, which had expected the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | title = Video Game Industry Celebrates Supreme Court Victory | first = Frank | last = Cifaldi | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223419/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO [[John Riccitiello]] asserted that the decision "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/business-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-video-games-sector-snap_8537172.html | title = Sector Snap: Game cos. cheer Supreme Court ruling | work = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate  =2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision.  Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association [[Chris Dodd]] recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that "We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law."&lt;ref name="ew reactions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | title = Supreme Court rules against law restricting video game violence | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first = Jeff | last = Labrecque | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630082722/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups that supported the California law were critical of the decision. California State Senator Leland Yee was very critical of the decision, claiming that "It is simply wrong that the video game industry can be allowed to put their profit margins over the rights of parents and the well-being of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/06/author-of-violent-video-games-law-blasts-supreme-court-decision/1 | title = Author of violent video games law blasts Supreme Court decision | first = Brett | last = Molina | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee stated he would review the opinions and attempt to reintroduce a new bill within the constitutionality of the decision, and claimed it was "disappointing the court didn't understand just how violent these games are."&lt;ref name="forbes decision"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/entertainment-us-supreme-court-violent-video-games_8537064.html | title = Court overturns ban on video game sales to kids | first = Jesse | last = Holland | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate =2011-06-27 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Steyer of [[Common Sense Media]] also criticized the decision, citing that "If parents decide a violent game is okay for their kid, that's one thing, but millions of kids are not able to judge the impact of ultra-violence on their own."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | title = Analysis: Despite Ruling, Threats Remain For The Games Industry | first = Chris | last = Morris | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629094614/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Schlafly|Andy Schlafly]], who had submitted a brief to the court on behalf of the Eagle Forum and Legal Defense Fund, heavily criticized the majority opinion, believing that "the court's latest disregard of parental rights is on a crash course with technological advances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | title = Opposing view: Violent videos warp young minds | first = Andy | last = Schlafly | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701113428/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Winter of the [[Parents Television Council]] asserted that the Court's decision "replaces the authority of parents with the economic interests of the video game industry."&lt;ref name="ew reactions" /&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' opined that the California law "did nothing to infringe on the rights of adults" while dealing with "reasonable limitations on minors' access to extremely violent games that even the video game industry acknowledges are inappropriate," and that with the high bar for any future legislation, the onus is on the video game industry to maintain its self-policing of video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | title = The high court's misguided decision on violent video games | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221239/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | archivedate = 2014-03-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts believed that while this was a major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb &amp; Loeb believed that similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards "privacy and security" of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that [[Playdom]] had to pay for violating privacy of its younger users.&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | title = Violent Video Game Debate: Where Do We Go From Here? | first = David | last = Daw | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215655/http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Schiesel of the ''[[New York Times]]'' proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that [[video games as an art form|video games are a form of art]], questioning the industry "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?"&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | title = Supreme Court Has Ruled; Now Games Have a Duty | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Seth | last = Schiesel | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701202527/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a "dangerous enemy" in that game.&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel" /&gt;

In January 2012, the state of California agreed to pay the ESA $950,000 for reimbursing the ESA's legal fees during the Supreme Court trial, atop approximately $350,000 in fees from the previous trials at lower courts.  The ESA stated that it will use an unspecified portion of this money to help create after-school programs in "underserved" communities in the Oakland and Sacramento areas to help teach students job skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |title=California paying $950,000 for failed Supreme Court fight |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |first2=Brendan |last2=Sinclair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206095142/http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |archivedate=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of defending the case is estimated around $1.8 million, including the State's own legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |title=Failed legal fight over video games costs California nearly $2 million |first=Jim |last=Sanders |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222015544/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Kenneth Doroshow and Paul M. Smith, the lawyers for the EMA who argued the case, were presented with the Ambassador Award by the [[International Game Developers Association]] [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. The Ambassador Award "honors an individual or individuals who have helped the game industry advance to a better place, either through facilitating a better game community from within, or by reaching outside the industry to be an advocate for video games".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Game Developers Choice Online Awards – Ambassador Award Archive | url = http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | publisher = UBM Tech | date = March 2012 | accessdate = November 16, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130202090125/http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | archivedate = February 2, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a seminar given in November 2014, Justice [[Elena Kagan]] expressed her thoughts on the decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what the state of the law was, and in hindsight, was still not sure if they made the right decision. She noted that she along with four others on the  court effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | title = Supreme Court justice second-guesses decisive vote in gaming free speech case | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2015-01-08 | accessdate = 2015-01-08 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150108044005/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | archivedate = 2015-01-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Gallagher, CEO of the ESA, observed in 2017 that the same [[moral panic]] that led to concerns over video games and resulting in this case were starting to appear for newer video game systems that can further blur lines between the virtual and real world, such as [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], and [[mixed reality]], and anticipates that there will be further tests of the applicability of First Amendment protection these new forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | title = Gaming beat the Supreme Court — now it's time to defend AR and VR | first = Jeff | last = Grubb | date = May 2, 2017 | accessdate = May 2, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170503002612/https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | archivedate = May 3, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
A national telephone poll conducted in the second quarter of 2011 by [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s [[Fairleigh Dickinson University#PublicMind|PublicMind]] showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that states should have the "right to regulate the sale of video games [that are violent] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography." On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court's majority that "parents should make the decision" about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes "too violent." These voters agreed with the statement "states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for [minors], any more than they have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent." The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="publicmind.fdu.edu"&gt;Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (June 6, 2011).

'''Burkinabé nationality law''' is the body of law concerning who is a [[citizen]] of [[Burkina Faso]]. The basis of Burkinabé nationality law is ''Aatu no. An VII 0013/fP/PreS du 16 novembre 1989, portant institution et application du Code des personnes et de la famille''.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

==Acquisition of Burkinabé citizenship==
===By birth===
Birth in Burkina Faso alone does not automatically confer Burkinabé citizenship, unless the parents are unknown, at least one parent was born in Burkina Faso, or the child would otherwise become [[statelessness|stateless]]. A child born in Burkina Faso to non-citizen parents may, however, be eligible to apply for citizenship at a later date.&lt;ref name=Manby&gt;{{cite web|author=Manby, Bronwen|title=Citizenship Law in Africa: A Comparative Study|edition=2|publisher=Open Society Institute|date=2010|accessdate=2013-07-04|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/docs/OtherEntities/OSJI%20CitizenshipAfricaStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By descent===
Any child who has at least one Burkinabé citizen parent has a right to Burkinabé citizenship from birth, regardless of the place of birth or the marital status of the parents.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

===By marriage===
The spouse of a Burkinabé citizen becomes a Burkinabé citizen automatically, regardless of sex. There is no requirement to reside in Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

===By naturalisation===
A foreign national may apply for Burkinabé citizenship upon meeting the following conditions:
*10 years residence in Burkina Faso (reduced to 2 years if born in Burkina Faso);
*Good moral character;
*No convictions;
*Good mental health.

There is no requirement to renounce previous nationalities.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Burkinabé citizens are permitted to hold [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]].&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
Burkinabé citizenship acquired by birth cannot be revoked against the citizen's will. Burkinabé citizenship acquired by naturalisation may be revoked upon a finding the it was fraudulently acquired, criminal convictions, or disloyalty to Burkina Faso. Those who have their citizenship revoked have a right to challenge the revocation in court.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4137">The '''Cabilly patents''' are two US patents issued to [[Genentech]] and City of Hope which relate to the "fundamental technology required for the artificial synthesis of antibody molecules." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6374653 | volume=81 | title=Generation of antibody activity from immunoglobulin polypeptide chains produced in Escherichia coli. | date=Jun 1984 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=3273–7 | doi=10.1073/pnas.81.11.3273 | pmc=345489 | last1 = Cabilly | first1 = S | last2 = Riggs | first2 = AD | last3 = Pande | first3 = H | last4 = Shively | first4 = JE | last5 = Holmes | first5 = WE | last6 = Rey | first6 = M | last7 = Perry | first7 = LJ | last8 = Wetzel | first8 = R | last9 = Heyneker | first9 = HL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to lead inventor Shmuel Cabilly, who was awarded the patent while working at City of Hope in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collectiveip.com/technology-transfer/city-of-hope/patents?fin=Shmuel+Cabilly&lt;/ref&gt; There was ongoing legal controversy surrounding these patents since their original filing in 1983.  In 2008, the litigation that was pending before the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was fully resolved and dismissed.

An interference between {{US patent|4,816,567}} (the original "Cabilly patent") co-issued to Genentech and City of Hope and {{US patent|4,816,397}}  (the "Boss" patent) issued to Celltech resulted in the issuance of a second "Cabilly patent" to Genentech in 2001. This new patent would extend into 2018, an effective term of 29 years.

A lawsuit filed by [[MedImmune]], a licensee of the Cabilly patent, resulted in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case [[MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.]] which was decided in favor of MedImmune. Following the supreme court decision, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) declared Genentech's patent invalid, but Genentech appealed that decision to the USPTO.  The patent remained valid and enforceable until the process was completed.  Genentech's "Cabilly II" patent 6,331,415  was then found, after USPTO reexamination, to be enforceable.  MedImmune and Centocor have settled with Genentech (1).  Currently, two other challenges are in the courts.  GlaxoSmithKline and Human Genome Sciences both are challenging the patent under antitrust law (1).  This is based on the settlement between Genentech and Celltech and their dispute over the original Cabilly patent 4,816,567 and the Celltech's patent 4,816,397.

An important implication of this case is the affirmation that a licensee retains the right to challenge a licensed patent. The controversy has also called attention to the amount of time the USPTO takes to resolve [[Interference proceeding]]s, and has been cited in arguments for changing to a [[First to file]] patent system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16118">'''Canadian privacy law''' is derived from the [[common law]], statutes of the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the various provincial legislatures, and the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Perhaps ironically, Canada's legal conceptualization of privacy, along with most modern legal Western conceptions of privacy, can be traced back to Warren and Brandeis’s [[The Right to Privacy (article)|“The Right to Privacy”]] published in the ''Harvard Law Review'' in 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/BlFw|title=History of Privacy|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Holvast states “Almost all authors on privacy start the discussion with the famous article ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'' of Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/BlFw|title=History of Privacy|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Evolution of Canadian privacy statutes==

Canadian [[privacy law]] has evolved over time into what it is today. The first instance of a formal law came when, in 1977, the Canadian government introduced data protection provisions into the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name="privcom.gc.ca"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.privcom.gc.ca/speech/archive/02_05_a_000128_e.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815133527/http://www.privcom.gc.ca/speech/archive/02_05_a_000128_e.asp |archive-date=2006-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] outlined that everyone has "the right to life, liberty and security of the person" and "the right to be free from unreasonable search or seizure",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020080846/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/#libertes |archive-date=2006-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not directly mention the concept of [[privacy]]. In 1983, the federal ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]'' regulated how federal government collects, uses and discloses personal information. Canadians' constitutional right to privacy was further confirmed in the 1984 Supreme Court case, ''Hunter v. Southam''.&lt;ref name="Communications"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/atip-aiprp/ip/p2.html?wbdisable=true|title=Department of Justice - THE OFFICES OF THE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY COMMISSIONERS: THE MERGER AND RELATED ISSUES|last=Communications|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Electronic|website=www.justice.gc.ca|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Section 8 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) was found "to protect individuals from unjustified state intrusions upon their privacy" and the court stated such ''Charter'' rights should be interpreted broadly.&lt;ref name="R. v. Dyment - SCC Cases Lexum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/375/index.do|title=R. v. Dyment - SCC Cases (Lexum)|website=scc-csc.lexum.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a 1988 Supreme Court case, the right to privacy was established as "an essential component of individual freedom".&lt;ref name="Communications"/&gt; The court report from ''R. v. Dyment'' states, "From the earliest stage of ''Charter'' interpretation, this Court has made it clear that the rights it guarantees [including privacy rights] must be interpreted generously, and not in a narrow or legalistic fashion".&lt;ref name="R. v. Dyment - SCC Cases Lexum"/&gt; Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, privacy legislation placed restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of information by provincial and territorial governments and by companies and institutions in the private sector.

===Governing relations with public sector institutions===

====''Privacy Act''====
{{main|Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Commissioner of Canada}}

The Privacy Act, passed in 1983&lt;ref&gt;http://www.priv.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_15_e.cfm Privacy Act&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Parliament of Canada]], regulates how federal government institutions collect, use and disclose personal information. It also provides individuals with a right of access to information held about them by the federal government, and a right to request correction of any erroneous information.&lt;ref name="privcom.gc.ca"/&gt;

The Act established the office of the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]], who is an Officer of Parliament. The responsibilities of the Privacy Commissioner includes supervising the application of the Act itself.
 
Under the Act, the Privacy Commissioner has powers to audit federal government institutions to ensure their compliance with the act, and is obliged to investigate complaints by individuals about breaches of the act. The Act and its equivalent legislation in most provinces are the expression of internationally accepted principles known as "fair information practices." As a last resort, the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] does have the "power of embarrassment", which can be used in the hopes that the party being embarrassed will rectify the problem under public scrutiny&lt;ref name="privcom.gc.ca"/&gt;

Although the office of the commissioner has no mandate to conduct extensive research and education under the current ''Privacy Act'', the Commissioner believed that he had become a leading educator in Canada on the issue of privacy.&lt;ref name="privcom.gc.ca"/&gt;

====''Access to Information Act''====
{{main|Access to Information Act}}

The next major change to the Canadian privacy laws came in 1985 in the form of the ''[[Access to Information Act]]''. The main purposes of the Act were to provide citizens with the right of access to information under the control of governmental institutions. The Act limits access to personal information under specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/A-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Freedom of Information Act''====

The ''Freedom of Information Act'' was enacted in 1996, and expanded upon the principles of the ''Privacy Act'' and ''Access to Information Act''. It was designed to make governmental institutions more accountable to the public, and to protect individual privacy by giving the public right of access to records, as well as giving individuals right of access to and a right to request correction of personal information about themselves. It also specifies limits to the rights of access given to individuals, prevents the unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of personal information by public bodies, and redefines the role of the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/f/96165_01.htm|title=Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act|work=gov.bc.ca|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension to private sector organizations===

====Federal====
{{main|Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act}}

The ''[[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]]'' ("PIPEDA") governs the topic of data privacy, and how private-sector companies can collect, use and disclose personal information. The Act also contains various provisions to facilitate the use of electronic documents. PIPEDA was passed in the late 1990s to promote consumer trust in electronic commerce, as well as was intended to assure other governments that Canadian privacy laws were strong enough to protect the personal information of citizens of other nationalities.

PIPEDA includes and creates provisions of the [[Canadian Standards Association]]'s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, developed in 1995. Like any privacy protection act, the individual must be informed of information that may be disclosed, whereby consent is given. This may be done through accepting terms, signing a document or verbal communication.

In PIPEDA, "Personal Information" is specified as information about an identifiable individual, that does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/02_06_01_01_e.asp#002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Provinces====

PIPEDA allows for similar provincial laws to continue to be in effect. [[Quebec]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]] have subsequently been determined to have similar legislation, and laws governing personal health information only, in Ontario and New Brunswick, have received similar recognition. They all govern:

* What personal information can be collected from individuals (including customers, clients and employees);
* When consent is required to collect personal information and how consent is obtained;
* What notice must be provided before personal information is collected, and
* How personal information may be used or disclosed;
* The purposes for which personal information may be collected, used or disclosed by the organization; 
* How an individual may get access to and request correction of his or her personal information held by the organization.

The provincial Acts that have been so recognized, and agencies responsible, are as follows:

==Development of personal privacy rights==

===Provincial statutes===

The ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' contains provisions governing privacy rights that can be enforced in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''CCQ'', ss. 3 and 35-37, as well as s. 5 of the ''Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms'', R.S.Q. c. C-12&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the following provinces have passed similar statutes:

* British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;''Privacy Act'', R.S.B.C. 1996 c. 373&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saskatchewan&lt;ref&gt;''Privacy Act'', R.S.S. 1978, c. P-24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manitoba&lt;ref&gt;''Privacy Act'', R.S.M. 1987 c.P125&lt;/ref&gt;
* Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;ref&gt;''Privacy Act'', R.S.N. 1990, c.P-22&lt;/ref&gt;

All four Acts establish a limited right of action, whereby liability will only be found if the defendant acts wilfully (not a requirement in Manitoba) and without a claim of right. Moreover, the nature and degree of the plaintiff‟s privacy entitlement is circumscribed by what is "reasonable in the circumstances".

===Evolution of the common law===

In January 2012, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] declared that the common law in Canada recognizes a right to personal privacy, more specifically identified as a "tort of intrusion upon seclusion",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2012/2012ONCA0032.pdf ''Jones v. Tsige'', 2012 ONCA 32, 2012-01-18]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as considering that [[appropriation of personality]] is already recognized as a tort in Ontario law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ontario Court of Appeal Recognizes New Privacy Tort |author1=Cathy Beagan Flood |author2=Iris Fischer |author3=Nicole Henderson |author4=Pei Li |url=http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=5161 |publisher=[[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]] |accessdate=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103210719/http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=5161 |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ramifications of this decision are just beginning to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = seclusion intrusion: a common law tort for invasion of privacy|author1=Rob Barrass |author2=Lyndsay A.

{{Equitable doctrines}}
'''Clean hands''', sometimes called the '''clean hands doctrine''' or the '''dirty hands doctrine''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/dirty-hands-doctrine.html |title=dirty hands doctrine definition |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Defense (legal)|equitable defense]] in which the [[defendant]] argues that the [[plaintiff]] is not entitled to obtain an [[equitable remedy]] because the plaintiff is acting [[Business ethics|unethically]] or has acted in [[bad faith]] with respect to the subject of the [[complaint]]—that is, with "unclean hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/unclean-hands.htm |title=Unclean Hands definition |publisher=Legal-explanations.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant has the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to show the plaintiff is not acting in good faith. The doctrine is often stated as "those seeking equity must do equity" or "equity must come with clean hands". This is a matter of protocol, characterised by [[A. P. Herbert]] in ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' by his fictional Judge Mildew saying (as Herbert says, "less elegantly"), "A dirty dog will not have justice by the court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncommon Law|edition=1st|date=1935|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|last=Herbert|first=A. P.|authorlink=A. P. Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clean hands doctrine is used in U.S. patent law to deny equitable or legal relief to a patentee that has engaged in improper conduct, such as using the patent to extend monopoly power beyond the claims of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant's unclean hands can also be claimed and proven by the plaintiff to claim other equitable remedies and to prevent that defendant from asserting equitable [[affirmative defense]]s. In other words, 'unclean hands' can be used offensively by the plaintiff as well as defensively by the defendant.  Historically, the doctrine of unclean hands can be traced as far back as the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]].

==Relation to equitable remedies==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[Equitable remedies]] are generally remedies other than the payment of [[damages]].  This would include such remedies as obtaining an [[injunction]], or requiring [[specific performance]] of a contract.  Before the development of the courts of [[Equity (law)|equity]] in [[England]], such remedies were unavailable in the [[common law]] courts, which were usually under the aegis of the local ducal noble, whereas equity flowed from the circuit-riding presence of the King's Chancellor who brought along his retainers to enforce his orders (in this sense, the development of the equity courts was a political effort by the Crown to further limit the power of local nobles).  Such remedies were developed in the equity courts, as the payment of damages was often not a sufficient remedy for a plaintiff in certain circumstances.  For example, if a landowner polluted the land of the neighbor, the common law [[tort]] of [[nuisance]] would only allow the innocent party to recover damages.  [[Common law]] had no remedy that would force the defendant to stop the [[pollution]].  Equity courts developed such a remedy, the injunction, that provided an ongoing bar to the activity that caused the damage, as well as affirmative orders called mandamus which compelled a directed party to do a certain thing (which the Chancellor could enforce while there).  

Equity courts realized that such extraordinary remedies were only justified in extraordinary cases, and would generally not grant such a remedy where damages were sufficient to make the plaintiff whole.  For example, if a car dealership broke a contract of sale and refused to deliver a particular car, which now could only be obtained for $10,000 more than what the plaintiff was willing to pay, the courts would merely award the plaintiff $10,000 (in addition to the original amount paid, if it had already been paid).  It would not force the dealer to obtain exactly the same car and sell it to the plaintiff.  However, if the subject matter of the sale were unique, such as a particular work of art or real estate, the court would order specific performance and require the sale.

However, equity courts also realized that these extraordinary remedies were subject to abuse.  For example, if a doctor had signed a [[non-compete clause]] with a clinic, the non-compete clause might prevent the doctor from earning a living if he left the clinic's employment.  As such, the court will generally only grant these remedies on the strictest terms.  If there is any indication that the plaintiff seeking the remedy had acted in bad faith, either prior to the commencement of the [[litigation]] or afterwards, the court will generally not grant the remedy.  For example, if the doctor left the clinic because it was involved in insurance [[fraud]], a court would most likely refuse to enforce the non-compete agreement by issuing an injunction, although it might allow the clinic to recover damages if they did lose business to the doctor.  Much of the various limitations, often expressed as "maxims of equity", arose from the sheer physical fact that the Chancellor and his enforcers would soon be moving on to another locale, and thus equity tended to be careful in allowing access to its powerful remedies and to order only that which would be quickly or effectively enforced.

The '''DIY Kindle Scanner''', or Do It Yourself Kindle Scanner, is a robotic device made from [[Lego Mindstorms]] which was designed and built by Peter Purgathofer from 2012 to 2013.  The robot interfaces with Purgathofer’s personal computer and a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] to make a copy of the Kindle e-book.  This robot in effect bypasses the [[Digital rights management#DRM and e-books|digital rights management system]] set in place to protect Kindle e-books.

==Background ==
Peter Purgathofer is an associate professor at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria.

When he released a video on Vimeo documenting the operation of the device, Purgathofer wrote that the project was meant to be an artistic reflection connecting the ideas of “book scanning, copyright, and digital rights management.” &lt;ref&gt;Purgathofer, Peter. [https://vimeo.com/73675285 "DIY Kindle Scanner"], ''Vimeo''. Retrieved October 06, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a reply to an email, Purgathofer stated that the project was not meant to be a negative reaction against Kindle e-books, but rather a way to use both Lego Mindstorms and the Kindle in a way that neither was usually intended to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Hesseldahl, Arik. [http://allthingsd.com/20130906/how-a-man-in-austria-used-legos-to-hack-amazons-kindle-e-book-security/ "How a Man in Austria Used Legos to Hack Amazon’s Kindle E-Book Security"], ''All Things D''.

==Operation==
[[Image:"DIY Kindle Scanner Operation.jpg".jpg|thumb|Operation of the DIY Kindle Scanner.]]
The robot is first set up so that it can operate the computer as well as hold the Kindle.  The image capture software must already be running on the computer and the Kindle must be open to the first page of the book to be scanned into the computer.  The robot then runs through a loop where it hits the spacebar to activate the camera on the computer and then uses finger-like robotic appendages to turn to the next page on the Kindle.  This loop is then repeated until all pages have been scanned into the computer.  [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) software is then used to convert the scanned images into a duplicate of the original Kindle e-book in a plain text file.

==Reaction==
Several critics have recognized that more direct means of bypassing digital rights management are available. In this context, the DIY Kindle Scanner has been labeled as a type of [[Rube Goldberg machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Claire. [http://www.mhpbooks.com/austrian-professor-builds-lego-robot-to-bypass-kindle-drm/ "Austrian professor builds Lego robot to bypass Kindle DRM"], ''Melville House''. Retrieved October 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Cory Doctorow made the claim that the project was in fact a legal means of bypassing digital rights management. This claim has been supported with the argument that the DIY Kindle Scanner simply exploits the [[analog hole]] which is applicable to all digital rights management systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Claire. [http://www.mhpbooks.com/austrian-professor-builds-lego-robot-to-bypass-kindle-drm/ "Austrian professor builds Lego robot to bypass Kindle DRM"], ''Melville House''. Retrieved October 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the question of the legality of this project, Purgathofer has scanned only one e-book with this method and he explains that he has not shared the copy with anyone because he is worried that "It would get me in deep trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Hesseldahl, Arik. [http://allthingsd.com/20130906/how-a-man-in-austria-used-legos-to-hack-amazons-kindle-e-book-security/ "How a Man in Austria Used Legos to Hack Amazon’s Kindle E-Book Security"], ''All Things D''. Retrieved October 06, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Purgathofer states that this project should not be associated with his academic work. In explanation, he said, "It’s a private project."&lt;ref&gt;Hesseldahl, Arik. [http://allthingsd.com/20130906/how-a-man-in-austria-used-legos-to-hack-amazons-kindle-e-book-security/ "How a Man in Austria Used Legos to Hack Amazon’s Kindle E-Book Security"], ''All Things D''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27142">'''DNA paternity testing''' is the use of [[DNA profiling]] (known as genetic fingerprinting) to determine whether two individuals are [[biology|biologically]] parent and child. A paternity test establishes genetic proof whether a man is the biological father of an individual, and a maternity test establishes whether a woman is the biological mother of an individual. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent to a grandchild. Though [[genetics|genetic]] testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including [[blood type|ABO blood group typing]], analysis of various other [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s, or using [[human leukocyte antigen]] [[antigen]]s. The current techniques for paternity testing are using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the woman is still pregnant from a blood draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1113044 "A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy" New England Journal of Medicine May 3, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html|title=Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=19 June 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage. In a DNA parentage test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioforensics.com/conference/Paternity/|title=Paternity Indices|date=19 April 2004|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040419145247/http://www.bioforensics.com/conference/Paternity/|archivedate=19 April 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2014}} is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as "[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693|title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2006-08-15|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paternity or maternity testing for child or adult==
The testing is performed by collecting buccal cells found on the inside of a person's cheek using a buccal swab or cheek swab. These swabs have wooden or plastic stick handles with a cotton on synthetic tip. The collector rubs the inside of a person's cheek to collect as many buccal cells as possible. The buccal cells are then sent to a laboratory for testing. For paternity testing, samples from the alleged father and child would be needed. For maternity testing, samples from the alleged mother and child would be needed.

==Prenatal paternity testing for unborn child==

===Invasive prenatal paternity testing===
It is possible to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called [[chorionic villus sampling]] or [[amniocentesis]]. Choronic villus sampling (CVS) retrieves choronic villus (placental tissue) in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, there is a small risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and Amnio require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.

===Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing===
Current advances in genetic testing have led to the ability to determine who the biological father is while the woman is still pregnant through a non-invasive method. There is a small amount of fetal DNA ([[cffDNA]]) present in the mother's blood during pregnancy. This allows for accurate fetal DNA paternity testing during pregnancy from a blood draw with no risk of miscarriage. Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation, and the amount of cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1113044 |title="The New England Journal of Medicine "A Non-invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy" May 3, 2012|publisher=The New England Journal of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_moc.semityn.www/|title=The New York Times "Before Birth, Dad's I.D."

==DNA profiling==
[[File:DNA paternity testing en.svg|thumb|Example of DNA profiling in order to determine the father of a child (Ch). Child's DNA sample should contain a mixture of different size DNA bands of both parents. In this case person #1 is likely the father]]
{{main|DNA profiling}}
The [[DNA]] of an individual is the same in every somatic (nonreproductive) [[cell (biology)|cell]]. [[Sexual reproduction]] brings the DNA of both parents together randomly to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of both their parents in equal amounts. This genetic material is known as the nuclear [[genome]] of the individual, because it is found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].

Comparing the DNA sequence of an individual to that of another individual can show whether one of them was derived from the other. However, DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. Specific sequences are usually looked at to see whether they were copied verbatim from one of the individual's genome to the other. If that was the case, then the genetic material of one individual could have been derived from that of the other (i.e. one is the parent of the other). Besides the nuclear DNA in the nucleus, the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the cells also have their own genetic material termed the [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling.

Proving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can prove only if two individuals are related by [[common descent]] through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is, thus, of limited value (for instance, it could not be used to test for paternity).

In testing the paternity of a male child, comparison of the [[Y chromosome]] can be used, since it is passed directly from father to son.

In the US, the [[AABB]] has regulations for DNA paternity and family relationship testing; however, AABB accreditation is not necessary. DNA test results are legally admissible if the collection and the processing follows a chain of custody. Similarly in Canada, the SCC has regulations on DNA paternity and relationship testing; however, this accreditation is recommended, but not necessary.

The Paternity Testing Commission of the [[International Society for Forensic Genetics]] has taken up the task of establishing the biostatistical recommendations in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] standards.&lt;ref name="GjertsonBrenner2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gjertson|first1=David W.|last2=Brenner|first2=Charles H.|last3=Baur|first3=Max P.|last4=Carracedo|first4=Angel|last5=Guidet|first5=Francois|last6=Luque|first6=Juan A.|last7=Lessig|first7=Rüdiger|last8=Mayr|first8=Wolfgang R.|last9=Pascali|first9=Vince L.|last10=Prinz|first10=Mechthild|last11=Schneider|first11=Peter M.|last12=Morling|first12=Niels|title=ISFG: Recommendations on biostatistics in paternity testing|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=1|issue=3-4|year=2007|pages=223–231|issn=1872-4973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2007.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bio-statistical evaluations of paternity should be based on a likelihood ratio principle - yielding the [[Paternity Index]], PI. The recommendations provide guidance on concepts of genetic hypotheses and calculation concerns needed to produce valid PIs, as well as on specific issues related to [[population genetics]].

==History==
The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching [[blood type]]s between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can only produce a child with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or O blood type. This most often led to inconclusive results, as only 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent under this form of testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1920.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, a new form of blood testing, [[serology|serological]] testing, which tests certain proteins in the blood, became available, with a 40% exclusion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnacenter.com/science-technology/dna-history-1930.html|title=History of DNA Testing - DNA Diagnostics Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, highly accurate genetic paternity testing became a possibility when [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] typing was developed, which compares the genetic fingerprints on white blood cells between the child and alleged parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19771223&amp;id=AAkdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7Z4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6700,5859572|title=The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; HLA tests could be done with 80% accuracy, but could not distinguish between close relatives.&lt;ref name=answers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|title=Paternity Testing Resources|date=19 November 2004|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119070715/http://www.paternity-answers.com/history-paternity-test.html|archivedate=19 November 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic parental testing technology advanced further with the isolation of the first [[restriction enzyme]] in 1970. Highly accurate DNA parental testing became available in the 1980s with the development of [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]]. In the 1990s, [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], developed in 1983, became the standard method for DNA parental testing. A simpler, faster, and more accurate method of testing than RFLP, it has an exclusion rate of 99.99% or higher.&lt;ref name=answers/&gt;

==Legal evidence==
The DNA parentage test that follows strict [[chain of custody]] can generate legally admissible results that are used for child support, inheritance, social welfare benefits, immigration, or adoption purposes. To satisfy the chain-of-custody legal requirements, all tested parties have to be properly identified and their specimens collected by a third-party professional who is not related to any of the tested parties and has no interest in the outcome of the test.

The [[Legal burden of proof|quantum of evidence]] needed is [[clear and convincing evidence]]; that is, more evidence than an ordinary case in [[civil litigation]], but much less than beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] required to convict a defendant in a criminal case.

In recent years, immigration authorities in various countries, such as U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, France, and others have been requesting immigration petitioners and beneficiaries in a family-based immigration case to voluntarily take the DNA parentage test when primary documents such as birth certificate to prove biological relationship are missing or inadequate.

In the U.S., immigration applicants bear the responsibility of arranging and paying for DNA testing. The U.S. immigration authorities require that the DNA test, if pursued, be performed by one of the laboratories accredited by the [[AABB]] (formerly American Association of Blood Banks). Similarly, in Canada, the lab needs to be accredited by the SCC.

The U.S. Department of State&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/info/info_1337.html|title=DNA and Parentage Blood Testing|date=22 March 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322024749/http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/info/info_1337.html|archivedate=22 March 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USCIS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/genetic_testing.pdf|title=Genetic Relationship Testing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide information concerning the DNA parentage test request for immigration purposes.

Although paternity tests are more common than maternity tests, there may be circumstances in which the biological mother of the child is unclear. Examples include cases of an [[Adoption|adopted]] child attempting to reunify with his or her biological mother, potential [[Babies switched at birth|hospital mix-ups]], and [[in vitro fertilization]] where the laboratory may have implanted an unrelated embryo inside the mother.

Other factors, such as new laws regarding reproductive technologies using donated eggs and sperm and surrogate mothers, can mean that the female giving birth is not necessarily the legal mother of the child. For example, in Canada, the federal Human Assisted Reproduction Act provides for the use of hired surrogate mothers. The legal mother of the child may, in fact, be the egg donor. Similar laws are in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.

==Legal issues==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court, and are for personal knowledge only. Only a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. If parental testing is being submitted for legal purposes in the U.S., including immigration, testing must be ordered through a lab that has [[AABB]] accreditation for Relationship DNA testing. All accredited labs are listed on the AABB's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|title=Accredited Parentage Testing Facilities|date=18 February 2006|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218003033/http://www.aabb.org/Content/Accreditation/Parentage_Testing_Accreditation_Program/AABB_Accredited_Parentage_Testing_Laboratories/|archivedate=18 February 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal implications of a paternity result test vary by state and according to whether the putative parents are unmarried or married. If a paternity test does not meet forensic standards for the state in question, a court-ordered forensic test may be required for the results of the test to have legal meaning. For unmarried parents, if a parent is currently receiving child support or custody, but DNA proves that the man is not the father later on, the support automatically stops; however, in many states, this testing must be performed during a narrow window of time if a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form has already been signed by the putative father; otherwise, the results of the test may be disregarded by law, and in many cases, a man may be required to pay child support, even though the child is biologically unrelated. In a few states, if the mother is receiving the support, then that alleged father has the right to file a lawsuit to get back any money that he lost from paying support. As of 2011, and in most states, unwed parents confronted with a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form are informed of the possibility and right to request a DNA paternity test. If testing is refused by the mother, the father may not be required to sign the [[birth certificate]] or the voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form for the child. For wedded putative parents, the husband of the mother is presumed to be the father of the child. However, in most states, this presumption can be overturned by the application of a forensic paternity test, but in many states, the time for overturning this presumption may be limited to the first few years of the child's life, depending on the law of the state in question.

===Canada===
Personal paternity-testing kits are available. The Standards Council of Canada regulates paternity testing in Canada whereby laboratories are ISO 17025-approved. In Canada, only a handful of labs have this approval, and it is recommended that testing is performed in these labs. Courts also have the power to order paternity tests during divorce cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandivorcelaws.com/paternity-test/|title=Paternity Test - CanadianDivorceLaws.com|website=www.canadiandivorcelaws.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
DNA paternity testing for personal knowledge is legal, and home test kits are available by mail from representatives of AABB- and ISO 17025-certified laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnahustisya.ph/|title=Fast, 100% Accurate AABB DNA Paternity Test - Philippines|website=dnahustisya.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA Paternity Testing for official purposes, such as sustento (child support) and inheritance disputes, must follow the Rule on DNA Evidence A.M. No. 06-11-5-SC, which was promulgated by the Philippine Supreme Court on October 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnahustisya.ph/for-attorneys/dna-rules-of-evidence/ DNA Rules of Evidence: Philippines] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140120085813/http://dnahustisya.ph/for-attorneys/dna-rules-of-evidence/ |date=2014-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there were no restrictions on paternity tests until the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] came into force in September 2006. Section 45 states that it is an offence to possess without appropriate consent any human bodily material with the intent of analysing its DNA. Legally declared fathers have access to paternity-testing services under the new regulations, provided the putative parental DNA being tested is their own. Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required. In the UK, the [[Ministry of Justice]] accredits bodies that can conduct this testing. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] produced a voluntary code of practice on genetic paternity testing in 2001. This document is currently under review, and responsibility for it has been transferred to the [[Human Tissue Authority]].

===France===
DNA paternity testing is solely performed on decision of a judge in case of a judiciary procedure in order either to establish or contest paternity or to obtain or deny child support.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 16-10 of the Civil Code&lt;/ref&gt; Private DNA paternity testing is illegal, including through laboratories in other countries, and is punishable by up to a year in prison and a €15,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 226-25 to 226-30 of the Penal Code&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conseil d'État (France)|French Council of State]] has described the law's purpose as upholding the "French regime of filiation" and preserving "the peace of families."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/french-men-s-insecurity-over-paternity-of-offspring-creating-a-society-of-doubt-1.773569&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Under the Gene Diagnostics Act of 2009, secret paternity testing is illegal. Any paternity testing must be conducted by a licensed physician or by an expert with a university degree in science and special education in parentage testing, and the laboratory carrying out genetic testing must be accredited according to [[ISO/IEC 17025]]. Full informed consent of both parents is required, and prenatal paternity testing is prohibited, with the exception of sexual abuse and rape cases. Any genetic testing done without the other parent's consent is punishable with a €5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_13827.asp|title=BIONEWS - Germany passes genetic test laws|website=www.bionews.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an amendment of the civil law [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p5526 section 1598a] in 2005, any man who contests paternity no longer automatically severs legal rights and obligations to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphabiolabs.com/paternity-test.html|title=Alpha Biolabs - Paternity Test|date=19 November 2010|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119013445/http://www.alphabiolabs.com/paternity-test.html|archivedate=19 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/constitutional-court-rules-secret-paternity-tests-still-illegal/a-2346882|title=Constitutional Court Rules Secret Paternity Tests Still Illegal - Germany- News and in-depth reporting from Berlin and beyond - DW - 13.02.2007|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
A paternity test with any legal standing must be ordered by a family court. Though parents have access to "peace of mind" parental tests through overseas laboratories, family courts are under no obligation to accept them as evidence. It is also illegal to take genetic material for a parental test from a minor over 16 years of age without the minor's consent. Family courts have the power to order paternity tests against the will of the father in divorce and child support cases, as well as in other cases such as determining heirs and settling the question involving the population registry. A man seeking to prove that he is not the father of the child registered as his is entitled to a paternity test, even if the mother and natural guardian object. Paternity tests are not ordered when it is believed it could lead to the murder of the mother, and until 2007, were not ordered when there was a chance that the child could have been conceived outside of marriage, making them a ''[[mamzer]]'' under Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/138511#.UPtikCfs6zo|title=Court Orders Paternity Test Despite 'Mamzer' Factor - Israel National News|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/court-may-side-with-husband-on-paternity-test-1.255798|title=Court May Side With Husband on Paternity Test|first=Ruth|last=Sinai|date=22 October 2008|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/mks-okay-paternity-testing-1.250360|title=MKs Okay Paternity Testing|first=Shahar|last=Ilan|date=24 July 2008|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Peace-of-mind paternity tests are a "big business" in Spain, partly due to the French ban on paternity testing, with many genetic testing companies being based in Spain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqOQJ9Q4STQhxRm0hOlLTXDWEC0g|title=AFP: Paternity tests take off in Spain thanks to French ban|date=10 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210025602/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqOQJ9Q4STQhxRm0hOlLTXDWEC0g|archivedate=10 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/Spain-Offers-Paternity-Tests-to-Suspicious-French-Fathers-29966-1.htm|title=Spain Offers Paternity Tests to Suspicious French Fathers|website=Medindia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace-of-mind parentage tests are widely available on the internet. For a parentage test (paternity or maternity) to be admissible for legal purposes, such as for changing a birth certificate, Family Law Court proceedings, visa/citizenship applications or child support claims, the process undertaken needs to comply with the Family Law Regulations 1984 (Cth) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.identilab.com.au/blogs/education/requirements-of-a-legal-paternity-test&lt;/ref&gt;. Further, the laboratory processing the samples must be accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nata.com.au/accredited-facility&lt;/ref&gt;.

===China===
In [[China]], paternity testing is legally available to fathers who suspect their child is not theirs. Chinese law also requires a paternity test for any child born outside the [[one-child policy]] for the child to be eligible for a ''[[Hukou system|hukou]]'', or family registration record. Family tie formed by adoption can also only be confirmed by a paternity test. A large number of Chinese citizens seek paternity testing each year, and this has given rise to many unlicensed illegal testing centers being set up.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministryoftofu.com/2010/11/chinas-census-gives-rise-to-paternity-test-netizens-comments-and-our-thoughts/|title=China’s census gives rise to paternity test, distrust; netizens’ comments and our thoughts - Ministry of Tofu 豆腐部|website=www.ministryoftofu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Reverse paternity testing==
Reverse paternity determination is the ability to establish the biological father when the father of a person, or a suspect, is not available. The test uses the STR [[alleles]] in mother and her child, other children and brothers of the alleged father, and deduction of genetic constitution of the father by the basis of genetic laws to create a rough amalgamation. The advantage of this knowledge is the ability to compare the father's DNA when a direct sample of the father is not available. An episode of ''[[Solved (TV series)|Solved]]'' shows this test used to see if a blood sample matches with the victim of a kidnapping.

The '''Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead paternity case''', a.k.a. '''''Birkhead v. Marshall''''', centered on a child born September 7, 2006 to Vicky Lynn Marshall (better known as [[Anna Nicole Smith]]). The child was named [[Dannielynn Birkhead|Dannielynn]], and was registered on her birth certificate as the daughter of Vickie Lynn Marshall (Smith) and her live-in partner [[Howard K. Stern]]. [[Larry Birkhead]], Smith's former love interest and  photographer, steadfastly maintained his contention that he was the baby's father and filed a lawsuit to challenge paternity after Smith had given birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,217358,00.html |title=Ex-Boyfriend Challenges Paternity of Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter |publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Birkhead and Stern, bodyguard/actor Alexander Denk, Mark Hatten and [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]], among others, claimed to be the father of Smith's daughter, Dannielynn. Although Stern was listed on her birth certificate, it was not certain that he was the father. At issue in a California court was who fathered the child, who could potentially inherit millions of dollars from Smith's estate. On September 26, 2006, Stern claimed in an interview from the Bahamas with [[Larry King]] on CNN  that he was the father of Smith's newborn  daughter.

After much media attention, on April 10, 2007, Michael Baird, who analyzed the results of a March 21 DNA test, announced the results that confirmed Birkhead to be the father of the baby.&lt;ref name="Cuticchia 2009 p. 63"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cuticchia |first=A.J. |title=Genetics: A Handbook for Lawyers |publisher=American Bar Association |series=ABA fundamentals |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60442-969-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cx9rIuWjr0gC&amp;pg=PA63 |access-date=30 September 2018 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA" /&gt;

== Name changes ==
A little over a month after the birth, a copy of the baby's disputed second birth certificate dated October 11, 2006 was made public showing she was renamed and registered as ''Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern'' on October 9, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2006/10/16/birth-certificate-for-anna-nicoles-baby/ Birth Certificate for Anna Nicole's Baby], ''TMZ.com'', October 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; From September 7, 2006 to October 11, 2006 the baby was in the records as  Hannibel Rose Stern. After the birth of her daughter, according to G. Ben Thompson, a former boyfriend of hers who is a [[real-estate developer]] in [[South Carolina]], Smith wanted to put him down as the father on the birth certificate, but he refused.  Thompson also was not convinced the baby was his because he had a [[vasectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fametastic.co.uk/archive/20061108/3255/anna-nicole-smith-begged-ex-boyfriend-to-claim-to-be-babys-father/ Anna Nicole Smith begged ex-boyfriend to claim to be baby's father] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316211804/http://fametastic.co.uk/archive/20061108/3255/anna-nicole-smith-begged-ex-boyfriend-to-claim-to-be-babys-father/ |date=March 16, 2007 }}, ''Fametastic'', November 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stern is named as the father on the earlier certificate, attorney Dion Smith Jr. signed his name where Stern's signature should have been. This [[Mistake (contract law)|discrepancy]] made the birth certificate [[Void (law)|invalid]] so that it could be possible for a new birth certificate to be asked for and a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA test]] sought to determine the father's identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/06/people_late_great/main2541656.shtml?source=RSSattr=Entertainment_2541656 Anna Nicole Baby's Certificate Invalid?: Bahamian Lawyer Says Wrong Signature Could Force DNA Test Request] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328084041/http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/06/people_late_great/main2541656.shtml?source=RSSattr%3DEntertainment_2541656 |date=2007-03-28 }}, ''The Showbuzz'', March 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/v2/news/0906/27/1/text.html Howard K. Stern Claims to Be Father of Anna Nicole's Baby], ''Extra'', September 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007 following the official results of the paternity test, Birkhead changed his daughter's surname to his last name, renaming her ''Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead''.

=== Paternity case and burial proceedings ===

On February 21, 2007 hearings commenced in Broward County Circuit court in Florida over  the disposition of Anna Nicole Smith's remains.  Larry Birkhead petitioned the court to ask Howard K. Stern to submit to a DNA test on February 20, 2007, but at the time Howard K. Stern stated he was not willing to do so in a closed conference with [[Larry Seidlin|Judge Larry Seidlin]]. The judge had put off the paternity question until after the issue of the location of Anna’s burial was decided.

At the request of Smith's mother, [[Virgie Arthur]], a Bahamian judge issued a temporary injunction on February 13, 2007, preventing Stern from taking Smith's daughter out of The Bahamas.

On February 22, 2007 a Florida judge awarded custody of Smith's body to Miami lawyer Richard Milstein, the [[ad litem|guardian ad litem]] for Dannielynn. Smith was buried in the Bahamas next to her late son [[Daniel Wayne Smith]] (1986–2006).

=== Paternity claims ===

==== Larry Birkhead ====
Birkhead was a [[Freelancer|freelance]] celebrity photographer in [[Los Angeles, California]]. When the question came up, Birkhead denied receiving money for media interviews, though he has received [[royalties]] for archived pictures he took of Smith.

According to Birkhead's testimony on February 21, 2007 while on the stand, he and Smith dated on and off from August 2005 to March  2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sawf.org/Gossip/26027.aspx Anna Nicole Smith's baby's 'real dad' confession], ''Sawf'', November 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Howard K. Stern ====
Stern was Smith's attorney who was named [[executor]] of her [[Will (law)|will]] which was drafted in 2001 by Eric James Lund, Esq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/annanicole/annanicole73001will.html Will of Vickie Lynn Marshall]&lt;/ref&gt; During the case, Stern denied that he had received money from media interviews he has conducted since Smith's death, though he admitted that he gave an interview to ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' on a flight that the show chartered immediately after her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah4059.shtml?dst=rss%7Cgeneral_rss Access Investigates: Who Is Howard K. Stern?], ''Access Hollywood'', February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/people/anna-nicole-smith/022107-pm_ctv.html?page=2 Former boyfriend of Anna Nicole Smith tells of miscarriage and drug abuse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231937/http://www.courttv.com/people/anna-nicole-smith/022107-pm_ctv.html?page=2 |date=September 26, 2007 }}, ''CourtTV News'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a lawyer of Smith's in the continuing litigation over the estate of her late husband, billionaire [[J. Howard Marshall]], he would be entitled to a [[contingent fee]] of roughly $5 million, five percent of any money she was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1536410_20012474,00.html Howard K. Stern: Anna Nicole Smith Paid My Rent], ''People'', February 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He has claimed to be the biological father of baby ''Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern''. Following the death of the baby's half-brother Daniel Wayne Smith, Smith put his name on the disputed second birth certificate issued for the baby then known as ''Hanna Rose''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0702/23/lkl.01.html More On The Battle Over Anna Nicole Smith's Body; The Bodyguard Speaks Out], ''CNN.com Larry King Live'', February 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Stern's sister, Bonnie, says Smith told her months before the birth that Birkhead could be the father. "When I spoke to (Smith) in March, when she found out she was pregnant, I took her shopping, and she told me the baby was due in mid-October, and that one other person could have been the father and that was Larry Birkhead, but nobody else."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-02-14-anna-nicole-smith_x.htm Howard Stern's sister: Smith unsure of paternity], ''USA Today'', February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt ====
[[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]], the husband of [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] at the time, claimed that he had Smith as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] for 10 years. He was quoted as saying that he could potentially be the father of Smith's daughter and said he would file a lawsuit if Dannielynn was turned over to Stern or Birkhead by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070209/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith_125 Gabor Husband may be Smith's baby's dad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213054347/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070209/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith_125 |date=February 13, 2007 }}, ''Associated Press'', February 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Associated Press, on February 12, 2007 Prinz von Anhalt announced that he would file a paternity claim and that his marriage likely would be over if his claims of parentage prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Anna-Nicole-Smith-Prince.html Gabor's Husband to File Claim for Baby]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2007, he filed legal documents at a courthouse in Santa Monica, California  seeking a DNA test to determine if he was the father of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daylife.com/search/gallery/all/1/0dr56s5gHuaVs?q=Frederic+von+Anhalt Frederic von Anhalt Santa Monica courthouse photo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212033643/http://www.daylife.com/search/gallery/all/1/0dr56s5gHuaVs?q=Frederic+von+Anhalt |date=2007-12-12 }}, [[Daylife]], February 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2007, he took a [[Polygraph|lie detector test]] in his attorney's office in Los Angeles. Prinz von Anhalt passed three lie detector tests that week, according to his attorney. The tests included questions about whether he had an affair with Smith and whether he could possibly be the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daylife.com/search/gallery/all/1/0aiX0Bl7ym4bF?q=Frederic+von+Anhalt Frederic von Anhalt lie detector test photo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212034335/http://www.daylife.com/search/gallery/all/1/0aiX0Bl7ym4bF?q=Frederic+von+Anhalt |date=2007-12-12 }}, [[Daylife]], February 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2007, he submitted a DNA sample to a Los Angeles clinic even though he was not involved in the paternity suit between Stern and Birkhead. He did not have a sample of the baby's DNA to analyze against, nor did he have a court order to submit to testing, but had stated that he wanted to be prepared if his paternity case had continued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinsideronline.com/celeb/5535/ Frederic Von Anhalt Offers DNA Sample] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070401130006/http://www.theinsideronline.com/celeb/5535/ |date=2007-04-01 }}, ''The Insider'', March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 2007 after the paternity test results were made public, representatives of Prinz von Anhalt released this statement wishing Birkhead well with raising the baby: "We never intended to take Dannielynn from anyone, we were just here in case Prinz von Anhalt was the father. We wish Larry luck in raising Dannielynn and we wish him the best."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2007/04/10/prince-to-birkhead-good-luck-with-the-baby/ Prince to Birkhead: Good Luck With the Baby], ''TMZ.com'', April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential paternity ===

==== Alexander Denk ====
Denk is an [[Austrian-American]] film actor and was the personal [[bodyguard]] of [[Anna Nicole Smith]] until her death on February 8, 2007.

Denk, according to his  attorney in a joint television interview, also said that he was Smith's [[confidant]], worked for her as her [[personal trainer]], and also was her [[bodyguard]] and [[chef]]. Denk is also friends with Stern. In the interview with [[Julie Banderas]], Denk said he and Smith were in a relationship and that he knew her for five and a half years. He added that they were [[Human sexual behavior|intimate]] on and off for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252423,00.html Anna Nicole's Bodyguard: I Could Be Dad], ''FoxNews.com The Big Story w/ John Gibson'', February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He reportedly told the entertainment news show [[Extra (U.S. TV program)|''Extra'']] that he had an affair with his former employer and that it was possible he could be the baby's father. On the show he claimed he and Smith had a passionate love affair that lasted for two years and that Smith suffered from life-threatening [[seizure]]s, for which she was on medication. When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, "She always told me she wanted to have her kids with me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2007/02/alex_denk.html |title=Could Anna Nicole's Bodyguard Be Dannielynn's Father? |date=February 12, 2007 |publisher=ExtraTV.com |accessdate=2007-03-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311115204/http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2007/02/alex_denk.html |archivedate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith "always told me I want you to be there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because I took care of Anna with her [[health]] and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy. And also this thing about the [[dieting]] and stuff, she doesn't want her baby to be [[overweight]] and [[Obesity|obese]]. She wants to make sure she is healthy."

==== J. Howard Marshall ====
[[J. Howard Marshall II]], also deceased, was Smith's second husband.  In February 2007, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' claimed to have seen an unpublished manuscript by Donna Hogan, Smith's younger half-sister, saying that Smith had become pregnant by Marshall: "To her family, she hinted that she had used the old man's frozen sperm, and would be giving birth to Marshall's child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/496332p-418242c.html |title=Old man and the seed? |work=[[New York Daily News]] | author1=Caruso, Michelle |author2=Siemaszko, Corky |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218064914/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/496332p-418242c.html |archivedate=February 18, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the publisher of Hogan's book, ''Train Wreck'', described the newspaper's claims as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21209167-5006301,00.html |title=Anna Nicole's paternity story 'a Hoax' |first=Stefanie |last=Balogh |publisher=[[news.com.au]] | date=February 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paternity case results ==
On April 10, 2007, Dr. Michael Baird, who analyzed the results of a March 21 DNA test, announced the results outside the Bahamian courthouse that Birkhead is confirmed at 99.99% to be the father of the baby.&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birkhead is Smith's Baby's Father, DNA Tests Reveal |url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=257945&amp;GT1=7703 |last=Muskal |first=Michael |publisher=MSN Entertainment |work= |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although DNA tests revealed Birkhead is the father, final custody of the baby remains unresolved. "I hate to be the one to say this but...I told you so," Birkhead told reporters and tourists waiting outside the courthouse in Nassau after a judge ruled behind closed doors that he was the biological father of Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, who was born on the island September 7. Larry Birkhead announced that he was the father of Dannielynn, Anna Nicole Smith's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birkhead biological father of Anna Nicole's baby |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-ex-annanicole11apr11,0,7537901.story?coll=la-home-local |last=Muskal |first=Michael |publisher=LATimes.com |work= |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2007-04-11}} {{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/10/smith.baby/index.html |title=Birkhead: I'm the father |date=2007-04-10 |publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stern says he will not contest Birkhead for sole custody and wants a smooth transition for the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/10/smith.baby/index.html |title=Birkhead named baby's dad; Stern won't fight for custody |date=2007-04-10 |publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">In [[legal theory]], a '''default rule''' is a rule of law that can be overridden by a contract, trust, will, or other legally effective agreement.  Contract law, for example, can be divided into two kinds of rules: ''default rules'' and ''mandatory rules.''  Whereas the ''default rules'' can be modified by agreement of the parties, ''mandatory rules'' will be enforced, even if the parties to a contract attempt to override or modify them.  One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules.

The idea of a default rule in contract law is sometimes connected to the notion of a [[complete contract]].  In [[contract theory]], a complete contract fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the contract for all possible future states of the world.  An incomplete contract, therefore, contains gaps.  Most contract theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete contracts. This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a contract from uncertainty.

The volume contains details of every [[consolidation Act]] relating to England and Wales passed since 1983 as well as details of earlier important consolidations.

Recent years have seen the enactment of a series of [[Tax Law Rewrite Project|Tax Law Rewrite Acts]], which are not consolidation Acts in the strict sense but share many similar features. Examples of such Acts are the [[Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003]], the [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], the [[Income Tax Act 2007]], and the [[Corporation Tax Act 2009]]. The stated aim of these Acts is to “re-write the United Kingdom’s primary direct tax legislation to make it clearer and easier to use, without changing the law”, which in effect means consolidating various pieces existing tax legislation, sometimes with minor changes. To aid users of these Acts, official destination tables are published showing how the previous law has been rewritten in the new legislation and these tables are included in this volume.

In exceptional circumstances a government department will publish a destination table for an Act which is neither a consolidation Act nor a re-write Act. An example is the [[Companies Act 2006]], which in effect re-wrote much of the [[Companies Act 1985]] although it was not explicitly a re-write Act. Given the significance of this piece of legislation, the destination table for the 2006 Act has been included in this volume.

==Contents of current volume==
The current volume is made up of two parts. Destination tables for individual consolidation/re-write Acts (which previously formed the bulk of the work) may be found in Part 2. These tables are for use where the consolidating enactment is known and the user wishes to see the previous legislation which made up the later enactment.
Part 1 of the work contains a series of tables which form a consolidated table of destinations made up of all the individual consolidations contained in Part 2. These tables allow users to trace the destination of an enactment where only that repealed enactment is known.

Each destination table shows (in two or three columns according to the information available) the enactments repealed or revoked by the consolidation Act (or group of consolidation Acts) concerned and the provisions of the consolidating/re-write Act or Acts replacing those enactments. The tables also cover enactments which are not repealed or revoked (being required for other purposes) but, as happens frequently, are partly or wholly reproduced in a consolidation Act in order to effect a proper consolidation.

In a typical table, the enactments listed are divided into sections, subsections, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs to the extent that it is necessary to provide a sufficient and exact account of the destinations of the repealed provisions. In older tables, where a repealed section which was divided into subsections is replaced without rearrangement by a single section similarly divided, the relevant entries are simplified accordingly, and where consecutive subsections in one column correspond exactly to consecutive subsections in the other column they are grouped together whether the subsection numbering is the same or not. More recent tables have not been so simplified and reproduced at the level of detail shown in the official tables.

==Reviews==
Glanville Williams said that the "Destination Table" was a "useful feature" of Halsbury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10562">'''Extended collective licensing''' (ECL) are collective copyright and related rights laws and licensing agreements. ECL agreements by law apply to all rights holders in a class, whether they are members of the [[collecting society]] or not, and establish terms of licenses with users or classes of users.  The first ECL laws and agreements were established in the Nordic countries in the 1960s for television and radio [[broadcasting]].

==ECL laws and agreements==
ECL is a form of [[collective rights management]] whereby ECL laws allow for freely negotiated copyright licensing contracts for the exclusive rights granted by [[copyright]]. ECL laws are designed specifically for mass use, where negotiating directly with individual copyright holders is not possible because of their sheer volume. Under ECL laws, [[collecting societies]] negotiate ECL agreements on behalf of their members, as well as non-members because ECL laws allow collecting societies to enter into ECL agreements on behalf of all rights owners of the category of rightsholder the collecting society represents. Once the collecting society and the user, such as a TV broadcaster, have negotiated an ECL agreement, it comes into force and covers only the types of copyrighted works for uses specified in the ECL licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =264–265 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ECL in Nordic countries==
The first extended collective licensing (ECL) laws were established in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (Nordic countries) in the 1960s. Committees in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with participation from Iceland, reviewed copyright laws and proposed ECL for the use of literary and music works under copyright in radio and TV broadcasting. In subsequent years ECL has been extended to other copyrighted works and areas of use, including the reuse of broadcasts through re-broadcast, on demand services and mass digitisation by libraries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =264–265 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors, performing artists, publishers and producers are well organised in Nordic countries and collecting societies have a high membership. Collecting societies cooperate in many instances to offer joint licensing agreements. According to Daniel Gervais these are ideal conditions for collective rights management of copyright and related rights through ECL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =263 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nordic model===
While individual ECL laws and agreements in Nordic countries vary depending on type of copyrighted works and area of use, the ''Nordic model'' shares the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =264 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ECL laws assume that collecting societies represent copyright and related rights owners in a particular area and that collecting societies can conclude contracts, i.e. copyright licenses, on behalf of their members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Olsson |first=Henry |title=The Extended Collective License As Applied in the Nordic Countries |work=Presentation at Kopinor 25th Anniversary International Symposium May 2005 |publisher=[[Kopinor]] |date=10 March 2010 |url=http://www.kopinor.no/en/copyright/extended-collective-license/documents/The+Extended+Collective+License+as+Applied+in+the+Nordic+Countries.748.cms |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302080731/http://www.kopinor.no/en/copyright/extended-collective-license/documents/The+Extended+Collective+License+as+Applied+in+the+Nordic+Countries.748.cms |archivedate=2 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* subject to certain conditions, such as representing a substantial number of rights owners, collecting societies can under ECL law apply to represent all rights owners on a non-exclusive basis in a specific category of copyrighted works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Gervais| first = Daniel | title = Application of an Extended Collective Licensing Regime in Canada: Principles and Issues Relating to Implementation| work = Study prepared for the Department of Canadian Heritage| publisher = University of Ottawa| date = June 2003| pages=5| url = http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~dgervais/publications/extended_licensing.pdf| format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ECL laws provide that a collecting society can through free negotiations conclude an ECL agreement with a user for certain uses
* ECL laws prescribes that this ECL agreement applies to members of that collecting society, as well as non-members
* ECL laws requires that collecting societies treat rights owners who are non-members in the same way they treat their members
* ECL laws gives non-members the right to individual remuneration, i.e. royalty payment, by the collecting society
* ECL laws typically gives non-members the right to exclude their works from ECL agreements so that a collecting society can not license their work under an ECL agreement (though not all ECL laws in Nordic countries provide an opt-out right)
* ECL laws and ECL agreements ensure that the user who has entered an ECL agreement with the collecting society is not subject to [[copyright infringement]] actions in relation to the use specified in the ECL agreement (this does not apply to works that are subject to an opt-out)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Olsson |first=Henry |title=The Extended Collective License As Applied in the Nordic Countries |work=Presentation at Kopinor 25th Anniversary International Symposium May 2005 |publisher=[[Kopinor]] |date=10 March 2010 |url=http://www.kopinor.no/en/copyright/extended-collective-license/documents/The+Extended+Collective+License+as+Applied+in+the+Nordic+Countries.748.cms |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302080731/http://www.kopinor.no/en/copyright/extended-collective-license/documents/The+Extended+Collective+License+as+Applied+in+the+Nordic+Countries.748.cms |archivedate=2 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ECL in the United Kingdom ==
The [[United Kingdom|British]] Government introduced extended collective licensing into UK copyright law in 2013 as part of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/24/contents/enacted&lt;/ref&gt; This was in part in recognition of the fact that collecting societies had for decades been offering licences that included the work of non-members. If a collecting society is granted the right by government to operate an ECL non-members can receive individual remuneration (i.e. royalty payments) as if they were a full member of a collecting society. Unlike some Scandinavian countries, non-members are given the right to opt out from any ECLs offered. The UK has introduced a general and flexible right for collecting societies to operate extended collective licences for many different purposes, as long as they can prove to government they are sufficiently representative of the sector they operate in. This contrasts to Swedish and Czech law where there is only a list of  specific uses to which licensing of this sort can be put.

== ECL in the Czech Republic ==
Extended collective licensing in the Czech Republic covers uses as wide as making available copyright works by libraries through to radio and television broadcasts.

== EU law ==
Paragraph 18 of the [[InfoSoc Directive]] preamble states that “This Directive is without prejudice to the agreements in the Member States concerning the management of rights such as extended collective licensing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =49 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of collecting societies representing non-members can also be found in the [[Satellite and Cable Directive]]. The directive provides that authorisation regarding non-members is to be dealt with collectively. Article 3.2 of the directive outlines the following criteria for collective management of rights, which is allowed under the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages =48 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W_N0ctyT10wC| isbn = 978-90-411-2358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A Member State may provide that a collective agreement between a collecting society and a broadcasting organization concerning a given category of works may be extended to rightholders of the same category who are not represented by the collecting society, provided that:
* the communication to the public by satellite simulcasts a terrestrial broadcast by the same broadcaster, and
* the unrepresented rightholder shall, at any time, have the possibility of excluding the extension of the collective agreement to his works and of exercising his rights either individually or collectively."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of ECLs in operation, including
* Much television and radio broadcast in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark.
* Many mass digitisations of in-copyright works by universities and libraries in Scandinavia are based on ECL. One example of this is the [http://www.nb.no/nbsok/search?mediatype=bøker Bøkhylla] project by the [[National Library of Norway]] which intends to digitise all books in the national library in Norwegian and make them available [http://www.dawn.com/news/1081204/literature-goes-online-for-free-in-norway online].

The '''German Evangelical Church''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Evangelische Kirche}}) was a successor to the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] from 1933 until 1945.

The [[German Christians]], an [[antisemitic]] and [[racism|racist]] pressure group and ''Kirchenpartei'',&lt;ref&gt;A Kirchenpartei (church party) in German Protestantism is a group nominating candidates in a list for church elections and compares roughly to [[nominating group]]s in the Church of Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; gained enough power on boards of the member churches to be able to install [[Ludwig Müller]] to the office of ''Reichsbischof'' in the 1933 church elections. The German Evangelical Church Confederation was subsequently renamed the German Evangelical Church. In 1934, the German Evangelical Church suffered controversies and internal struggles which left member churches either detached or reorganised into German Christians-led dioceses of what was to become a single, unified Reich Church compatible with Nazi ideology for all of [[Nazi Germany]]. 

In 1935, in wake of controversies and church struggles, the Ministry for Church Affairs removed [[Ludwig Müller]] and installed a committee headed by Wilhelm Zoellner to lead the confederation. As a result, the German Evangelical Church regained partial support as some of member churches that left rejoined. In 1936, the Zoellner committee denounced German Christians and increasingly leaned towards the [[Confessing Church]] and its positions. In 1937, the Nazis removed the Zoellner committee and reinstalled German Christians into the leading position. In 1937-1945, the German Evangelical Church was controlled by [[German Christians]] and the Ministry. It was no longer considered a subject to the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' (struggle of the churches) to [[Adolf Hitler]]. It officially disbanded in 1945. It was succeeded by the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] in 1948.

==Name==
It is also known in [[English language|English]] as the '''Protestant Reich Church''' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Reichskirche}}) and colloquially as the '''Reich Church''' ({{lang-de|Reichskirche}}).

==Overview==
In 1933, the [[German Christians]] took leadership in some [[Landeskirche|member churches]] of the German Evangelical Church Confederation. A new designation was voted on and adopted, with the organisation now being called the German Evangelical Church. In its early stages, it remained a loose confederation of churches just like its predecessor. It included a vast majority of [[Protestants]] in what was now [[Nazi Germany]], excluding those affiliated with the [[free churches]] like the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church (Germany)|Evangelical Lutheran Free Church]]. In a 1933 voting to the ''Reichssynode'', the German Christians were able to elect [[Ludwig Müller]], a pro-Nazi pastor, to the office of ''Reichsbischof'' ("Reich Bishop").&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Thomas M. ''Reichsbischof Ludwig Müller: eine Untersuchung zu Leben und Persönlichkeit''. (=Arbeiten zur kirchlichen Zeitgeschichte, Series B: Darstellungen; 19.) (384 pp) Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;. On December 20, 1933, Müller merged the church's Protestant Youth organisations into the [[Hitler Jugend]] without consulting their leadership or any member churches. Many in the German Evangelical Church resisted this idea and a discussion began. 

Müller tried to silence it by introducing discipline and using powers of the elected office. His attempts failed, prompting [[Adolf Hitler]] to meet with Protestant leaders on January 25, 1934. Although the meeting ended with Protestant churches declaring their loyalty to the state, removing Müller was not a subject to discussion for Hitler. After that, member churches began to either reorganise or detach from the German Evangelical Church. Initially, there was little resistance to the attempt to introduce elements of Nazi ideology into church doctrine. Most of the resistance came from confessing communities (''bekennende Gemeinden'') within "intact" and "destroyed churches" (see below) and the [[Pfarrernotbund]] (Emergency Covenant of Pastors) led by pastor [[Martin Niemöller]].

In consequence of the 1934 meeting, many member churches distanced themselves from the increasingly Nazi-controlled Reich Church due to controversies pertaining to its constitution, the [[nazification]] of its theology, leadership, incorporation of its Youth organisations into the Hitler Jugend, etc. Such churches became neutral or followed the Protestant opposition to Nazism that established an alternative [[umbrella organization|umbrella organisation]] of their own that became known as the [[Confessing Church]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany#|title=Germany|work=|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|date=|accessdate=2014-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004817/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany|archive-date=2013-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}} "Unification, World Wars, and Nazism"&lt;/ref&gt; The Reich Church ultimately ended up being a confederation of those [[Landeskirche|German Protestant churches]] that espoused a single doctrine named [[Positive Christianity]], which was compatible with [[Nazism]]. Although it aimed to eventually become a unified [[Protestant]] [[state church]] for all of [[Nazi Germany]], this attempt utterly failed as the German Evangelical Church became fractured into various groups that bore an unclear legal status in relation to each other:

*churches with a German Christians-dominated governing board reorganising them into dioceses of the Reich Church led by [[German Christians]] ("dioceses of the German Evangelical Church" [''Bistümer der Deutschen Evangelischen Kirche''] in official usage, or "destroyed churches" [''zerstörte Kirchen''] in the parlance of the Confessing Church)
*churches with a governing board without a German Christian majority merging them as members of the Reich Church, but rejected Müller as its leader (the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Churches of Bavaria]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover|of Hanover]], [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|of Westphalia]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|of Württemberg]]) ("intact churches" [''intakte Kirchen''] in Confessing Church parlance) 
*the [[Confessing Church]] that saw itself as the true Protestant church for all of Germany, provided resistance to the German Christians-led German Evangelical Church and to its so-called dioceses ("destroyed churches"), and acted on principles of the "1934 church emergency law of [[Berlin-Dahlem|Dahlem]]" that deemed the constitution of the German Evangelical Church "shattered" (the "Confessing Church", ''Bekennende Kirche'')

Müller's influence declined after more constant clashes in the German Evangelical Church, triggering the foundation of the ''Ministry for Church Affairs'' led by [[Hans Kerrl]] on July 16, 1935. A decree issued by Kerrl in September of 1935, appointed a committee led by [[Wilhelm Zoellner]] (Church of Westphalia) to head the Reich Church instead of Müller. It was received positively by intact churches and even confessing parts of the German Evangelical Church. In 1936, the committee denounced the teachings of the German Christians-controlled [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia|Church of Thuringia]], and the regime feared that the [[Confessing Church]] would gain more support due to this. In February 1937, the committee was removed by the Nazis and leading figures of the Protestant resistance like [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Martin Niemöller]] and others were arrested. In 1939, Müller tried to regain his position in the German Evangelical Church but failed to do so. After 1937, the German Evangelical Church was not considered an issue in the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' by the Nazis as it became heavily controlled by the Ministry until 1945.

In August 1945, the German Evangelical Church was officially dissolved by the council of the newly founded Protestant umbrella organisation called the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]].

==Beginnings, German Christians and Nazi influence (1933-1934)==

Under the [[Weimar Republic]], the system of [[state churches]] disappeared with the German monarchies. At this point, the unification of the Protestant churches into a single organisation seemed like a possibility, albeit a remote one.  Since unification, clergy and ecclesiastical administrators had discussed a merger, but one had never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation of [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] and [[United and uniting churches|United churches]]. In 1920, Swiss Protestant churches came together in the [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches|Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund (SEK)]]. Following their example, the then 28 territorially defined German Protestant churches founded the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation|Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund (DEK)]] in 1922. This was not a merger into a single church but a loose [[federation]] of independent ones.

The founding of the German Evangelical Church was the result of work by the ''Kirchenpartei'' of the [[German Christians]] who had gained a large majority at the 1933 church elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3164452 The 1933 German Protestant Church Elections: ''Machtpolitik'' or Accommodation?] by Shelley Baranowski. Church History, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Sep., 1980), pp. 298&amp;ndash;315. Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Society of Church History.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1934, the merger finally failed when the [[synod]]s of two of the 28 churches, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine]], the portion of Bavaria which forms today's Free State (without the Palatinate left of the Rhine), and the Evangelical State Church in Württemberg, refused to dissolve their church bodies as independent entities, and the Berlin-based ''[[Landgericht Berlin|Landgericht I]]'' court restored the largest church body, the by then already merged [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical Church of the Old-Prussian Union]] by its resolution in November the same year, thus resuming independence. Consequently, the German Evangelical Church, created as a merger, then continued to exist as a mere umbrella. 

==Controversies, internal struggles and conflict with the Confessing Church (1934-1937)==
Some Protestant functionaries and laymen opposed the unification. Many more agreed but wanted it under Protestant principles, not imposed by Nazi partisans. The Protestant opposition had organised first among pastors by way of the [[Pfarrernotbund|Emergency Covenant of Pastors]] and then&amp;mdash;including laymen&amp;mdash;developed into grassroots meetings establishing independent synods by January 1934. At the first Reich's Synod of Confession (''erste Reichsbekenntnissynode'') held in [[Wuppertal]]-[[Barmen]] between 29–31 May 1934, it called itself the [[Confessing Church]].

On July 16, 1935, [[Hanns Kerrl]] was appointed Reichsminister for Church Affairs, a newly created department.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krüger and Peter Noss, "Die Strukturen in der Evangelischen Kirche 1933-1945", in: ''Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932-1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten'', Olaf Kühl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171, here p. 160. {{ISBN|3-923095-61-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started negotiations to find a compromise and dropped the extreme German Christians, trying to win moderate Confessing Christians and respected neutrals. On September 24, 1935, a new law empowered Kerrl to legislate by way of ordinances within the German Evangelical Church, circumventing any synodal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;The law was euphemistically called ''Act on Safeguarding the German Evangelical Church'' ({{lang-de|Gesetz zur Sicherung der Deutschen Evangelischen Kirche}}, or colloquially ''Sicherungsesetz''. Cf. Krüger and Noss, pp. 149&amp;ndash;171, here p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerrl managed to gain the very respected Wilhelm Zoellner (a Lutheran, until 1931 General [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent]] of the old-Prussian [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|ecclesiastical province of Westphalia]]) to form the Reich's Ecclesiastical Committee (''Reichskirchenausschuss'', RKA) on October 3, 1935, combining the neutral and moderate groups to reconcile the disputing church parties. The official German Evangelical Church became subordinate to the new bureaucracy, and Müller lost power but still retained the now meaningless titles of German Reich's Bishop and old-Prussian State Bishop.

In November, Kerrl decreed the parallel institutions of the Confessing Church were to be dissolved, a move which was protested and ignored by Confessing Church leaders. On December 19, Kerrl issued a decree which forbade all kinds of Confessing Church activities, namely appointments of pastors, education, examinations, [[ordination]]s, ecclesiastical visitations, announcements and declarations from the pulpit, separate financial structures and convening Synods of Confession; further the decree established provincial ecclesiastical committees.&lt;ref&gt;Krüger and Noss, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171, here p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ''brethren councils'' had to go into hiding, and Kerrl successfully wedged the Confessing Church.

The [[Gestapo]] increased its suppression, undermining the readiness for compromises among the Confessing Church. Zoellner concluded that this made his reconciliatory work impossible and criticised the Gestapo activities. He resigned on February 2, 1937, paralysing the Ecclesiastical Committee which lost all recognition among the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Krüger and Noss, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171, here p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerrl now subjected Müller's chancery of the German Evangelical Church directly to his ministry and the national, provincial and state ecclesiastical committees were soon after dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Krüger and Noss, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171, here p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German Christian takeover until dissolution (1937-1945)==
Although the church was initially supported by the regime, the Nazis eventually lost interest in the experiment after it failed to supplant or absorb traditional Protestant churches. After 1937, relations between the Reich Church and the Nazi government began to sour.

On November 19, 1938, as reported on in the ''Ludington Daily News'', [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] was ordered to be erased from Protestant churches within the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] by Friedrich Werner, the president of its executive board (Evangelical Supreme Church Council; EOK). His order said the name of the 'God of Israel' (which contemporarily has Judaic connotations) must be obliterated wherever it was displayed in Protestant churches.

On September 1, 1939, Kerrl decreed the separation of the ecclesiastical and the administrative governance within the official Evangelical Church. The German Christian Friedrich Werner, president of EOK, won over August Marahrens, State Bishop of the "intact" [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Church of Hanover]], and the theologians Walther Schultz, a German Christian, and Friedrich Hymmen, vice president of the Old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme Church Council, to form an Ecclesiastical Council of Confidence (''Geistlicher Vertrauensrat''). This council exercised ecclesiastical leadership for the church from early 1940 and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Krüger, Barbara &amp; Noss, Peter (1999) "Die Strukturen in der Evangelischen Kirche 1933-1945", in: Kühl-Freudenstein, Olaf, et al. (eds.), ''Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932-1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten'' (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18) Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum  {{ISBN|3-923095-61-9}} pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171 (here p. 166)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 1941, the German Evangelical Church called for suited actions by all Protestant churches to withhold baptised non-[[Aryan]]s from all spheres of Protestant church life.&lt;ref&gt;Circular (Rundschreiben) by the church chancery of the ''German Evangelical Church'' to all governing bodies of the major Protestant [[Landeskirche]]n (22 December 1941), published in Kurt Meier, ''Kirche und Judentum: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirche zur Judenpolitik des Dritten Reiches'', Halle upon Saale: Niemeyer, 1968, pp. 116seq. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; Many German Christian-dominated congregations followed suit. The Confessing Church's executive together with the conference of the state brethren councils (representing the Confessing Church adherents within the destroyed churches) issued a declaration of protest.&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Kirchliches Jahrbuch für die Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland''; vol. 60-71 (1933-1944), Joachim Beckmann (ed.) on behalf of the Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, Gütersloh: Bertelsmann, 1948, pp. 482-485. ISSN 0075-6210.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, [[Theophil Wurm]], [[Landesbischof]] of Württemberg, invited representatives of the surviving German [[Landeskirche|regional Protestant church bodies]] to [[Treysa]] for August 31, 1945. As to co-operation between the Protestant churches in Germany, strong resentments prevailed, especially among the Lutheran church bodies of Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the Hamburgian State, Hanover, [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg|Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony|Saxony]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia|Thuringia]], against any unification after the experiences during Nazi rule. It was decided to replace the former [[German Evangelical Church Confederation|German Federation of Protestant Churches]] with the new umbrella Evangelical Church in Germany, provisionally led by the Council of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], a naming borrowed from the Reich's brethren council organisation.

In [[United States constitutional law]], the '''good-faith exception''' (also '''good-faith doctrine''') is a [[legal doctrine]] providing an exemption to the [[exclusionary rule]]. 

The exemption allows evidence collected in violation of [[privacy rights]] as interpreted from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to be admitted at [[trial (law)|trial]] if [[police officer]]s acting in [[good faith]] (''bona fides'') relied upon a defective search warrant &amp;mdash; that is, they had reason to believe their actions were legal (measured under the [[reasonable person]] test). 

The rule was established in the two [[companion case]]s decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1984: ''[[United States v. Leon]]'' (468 U.S. 897) and ''[[Massachusetts v. Sheppard]]'' (468 U.S. 981). The exception permits the courts to consider the mental state of the police officer.

'''Gun laws in Honduras''' refers to the regulation of the commerce, ownership, possession and use of firearms by the citizens and residents of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poa-iss.org/CASACountryProfile/PoANationalReports/2004@86@Honduras2004%20(eng).pdf|title=Gun laws in Honduras|author=Permanent Mission of Honduras to the United Nations|date=2004-04-28|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hondurans have remained passive{{weaselinline|date=May 2017}}{{clarify|date=May 2017}} on the control of proliferation of firearms in the country.  Escalation in crime and the use of firearms in the commission of crimes and homicides has brought political and public discourse to consider regulation of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Security/citizensecurity/honduras/documentos/violencia%20en%20cifras.pdf|title=Honduras:Violence by Numbers|author=[[Julieta Castellanos]]|publisher=Political Database of America-Georgetown University|date=2004-01-16|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 1985, there was no official regulation of gun ownership and possession by private citizens although Title III, Chapter IV, Article 94 of the Honduran Constitution of 1965, replaced in 1982, stated ''No one may possess or carry weapons without the permission of the competent authority. The law shall regulate this provision;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bib.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/04701852311547262977857/p0000001.htm|title=Constitution of Honduras of 1965|author=Government of Honduras|publisher=Mario Secoff|date=2004-04-11|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Constitution of 1957 on Title II, Chapter IV said ''The inhabitants of the republic can own and carry weapons in accordance with the law.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/constitucion/otras/c1957.html|title=Constitution of Honduras of 1957|author=Government of Honduras|publisher=Mario Secoff|date=2004-04-11|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[Constitution of Honduras]], enacted in 1982, makes no direct mention of the '[[right to keep and bear arms]]' and the role firearms should play as a [[constitutional right]]; however, Title V, Chapter X, Article 292  ''...reserve[s] as exclusive power of the Armed Forces the manufacturing, import, distribution and sale of arms, ammunition and the like.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honduras.com/honduras-constitution-english.html|title=Constitution of Honduras of 1982|author=Government of Honduras|publisher=Honduras.com|date=2005-05-04|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other clauses in the Constitution regarding the right of citizens to life and personal safety have served as foundation to the legislation and regulation of individuals' right to possession and the use of firearms.

Until June 2007, [[Open carry|openly carrying a firearm]] in public as well [[concealed weapon|carrying a concealed weapon]] was permitted&lt;ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2015}}{{cite web|url=http://www.honduras.com/honduras-constitution-english.html|title=Don't go off half-cocked; know the gun laws|author= Melanie Wetzel|publisher=HondurasThisWeek|date=2009-12-19|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but increased attention to deaths by firearm in the country led to further restrictions on the possession of firearms.  Current law still makes the purchase, ownership, and possession of firearms legal and it describes the type of firearms permitted for civilian ownership.&lt;ref name="Legal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunidadesegura.org/pt-br/node/24249|title=''Spanish'': Denuncian que hay 120 mil armas ilegales en Honduras|author=La Prensa Editor|publisher=La Prensa|date=2004-12-28|accessdate=2011-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003131721/http://www.comunidadesegura.org/pt-br/node/24249|archivedate=2011-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 small arms survey shows 6 guns owned per 100 citizens in Honduras.

== History ==
The legal control of the proliferation and of the illegal use of firearms is relatively new in Honduras.  Prior to 1985, ownership or possession of a firearm by a private citizen was considered no more than the ownership and possession of any other piece of property.  When a crime was committed using a firearm, other than regarding the weapon as evidence to the crime, its possession and use in the crime was not a crime by itself but the act committed, such as [[murder]] or [[robbery]], was the violation to prosecute.

In May 1985, when Honduras was transiting from military rule to a democracy, the Regulations for the Possession and Carrying of Weapons, Agreement Number 1029 was passed by the Legislative Power.  By the mid 1990s, the administration of police forces was no longer part of the armed forces and therefore gun regulation became a civil task.  In July 2000, the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material was enacted, outlining the rights and limitations of citizens regarding weapons. Since then, several reforms to the Act have been passed in an effort to limit the use of firearms in violent crimes, including homicides.

=== Gun culture ===
Hondurans and the laws of Honduras have had an individual freedom centered view on firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2010/11/26/en-honduras-son-muy-permisivos-en-el-control-de-armas-de-fuego/|title=''(Spanish)'' In Honduras they are permissive in the control of firearms|publisher=La Prensa|date=2010-11-26|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guns are carried openly in the countryside as a demonstration of [[machismo]] and virility.&lt;ref name=Clarín/&gt; Citizens of Honduras and non-citizens who are legal residents of the country may own handguns, shotguns, or rifles under the types and calibers permitted by law.  Firearms may be used for the purpose of hunting, competition, target practice, home protection, work protection, personal safety and any other hobby or recreational activity permitted by law.  Because of rise in crime, gun ownership in the home, business establishment and while working (such as delivery drivers, taxi drivers, and truckers) has become common.&lt;ref name=Clarín&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/11/25/um/m-02047932.htm|title=''(Spanish)'' Honduras, an armed country and with a high number of crimes|author=Clarín.com|date=2009-11-25|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone visiting a city in Honduras will immediately notice armed guards in virtually every establishment including restaurants, grocery stores, and everyday businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lagringasblogicito.blogspot.com/2007/02/guns-everywhere.html|title=Guns everywhere|author=LaGringa|publisher=La Gringa's Blogicito|date=2007-02-18|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "No Weapons Allowed" signs can be seen in certain places reminding patrons to leave their firearms at home when conducting business with them.  Besides the common frisk when entering a building, some establishments have gone as far as installing metal detectors to make sure visitors are unarmed when entering.  Rise in crime has brought some politicians to think the best way to protect citizens is from entirely banning firearms from civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Pa%C3%ADs/listado-nota/Ediciones/2011/02/25/Noticias/Sin-seguridad-Honduras-esta-condenada-al-caos-y-el-colapso|title=''(Spanish)'' Without security, Honduras is condemned to Chaos and Collapse|author=El Heraldo de Honduras|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 there were 220,000 registered guns in private ownership in addition to an estimated 500,000 illegal guns.&lt;ref name=Clarín/&gt; There is an active black market for firearms. Though officially banned, [[AK-47]] rifles can purchased for about $500.&lt;ref name=Clarín/&gt;

===Gun violence===
Crime has been endemic in Honduras for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/87731/|title=''(Spanish)'' Observatorio de la Violencia en Honduras|author=UNAH-Instituto Universitario de Democracia, Paz y Seguridad|publisher=National Autonomous University of Honduras|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.un.hn/publicaciones/Observatorio_Violencia/boletin_Mortalidad_nacional_2008_edi_13.pdf|title=''(Spanish)'' Violence in Honduras out of control|author=Agustín Lagos|publisher=El Heraldo de Honduras|date=2009-02-24|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high level of violence and killings experienced in the last 20 years led public officials to formulate laws restricting and regulating firearms in the country.  In 2008, Honduras held the second highest rate of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants with 78.6 percent of these committed by firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nannifontana.net/work.php?number=87|title=Violence in Honduras|author=Nanni Fontana|publisher=NanniFontana.net|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, Honduras holds the highest homicide rate in the world and [[San Pedro Sula]] holds the country's highest homicide rate with 137.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants.  Between 2005 and mid 2010, 79.38 percent of deaths were committed by firearm in the country.  The [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] estimates at least 800,000 guns in the country of which at least 650,000 are unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/tasa-de-homicidios-en-honduras-es-ocho-veces-superior-la-mundial|title=''(Spanish)'' Homicide rate in Honduras eight times as high as the world average|author=El Heraldo|publisher=América Economía|date=2010-10-25|accessdate=2011-06-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928041625/http://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/tasa-de-homicidios-en-honduras-es-ocho-veces-superior-la-mundial|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities believe some 500,000 guns considered ''weapons of war'' are in the hands of civilians and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/nota.aspx?id=128430|title=''(Spanish)'' Arsenal headed to Colombia seized in Honduras|author=Caracol Radio|date=2001-05-01|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the illegal guns in the country were acquired during the hostile years of the 1980s.  The cost of a bullet in Honduras varies from one to eight lempiras (US$0.06 to 0.42).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Sucesos/Ediciones/2010/02/16/Noticias/Regularan-tenencia-de-armas-en-Honduras|title=''(Spanish)'' Gun ownership will be regulated in Honduras|publisher=El Heraldo de Honduras|date=2010-02-15|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional rights ==
While the Constitution of Honduras make no explicit mention of citizens' right to weapons, it does include the following:
:''Article 61- The Constitution guarantees Hondurans and foreigners residents in the country the irrevocable right to life, personal safety, freedom, and equality before the law and [the right] to property.''

:''Article 59- The human person is the supreme purpose of society and the State. All have an obligation to respect and protect it. The dignity of human beings is inviolable...''

:''Article 274- The Armed Forces are subject to the provisions of its Constituent Law and other Laws and Regulations governing its operation... It will also cooperate with the institutions of public security, at the request of the Secretary of State in the Office of Security, to combat terrorism , arms trafficking and organized crime, as well as in the protection of the powers of the State and the Court of elections, to request, in its installation and operation.''

:''Article 292- It is reserved as exclusive power of the Armed Forces the manufacturing, import, distribution and sale of arms and ammunition and similar articles.''

These articles has been interpreted by the State as having the power to act through legislation to regulate the manufacture, import, distribution and sale of firearms, while recognizing ownership and possession of firearms for the citizens' ''legitimate defense''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clave-lat.com/webinvestigacion/analisis_armas_de_fuego_honduras.pdf|title=Analysis of the Legislation of Control of Firearms and Ammunition in Honduras|author=Center Of Investigation and Promotion of Human Rights-CIPRODEH|date=2006-12-20|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing and legislation ==
Only citizens of Honduras and foreign citizens who are legal residents of Honduras may purchase, own, possess, or transport any handgun, shotgun, or rifle as permitted and defined under the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials.&lt;ref name="Legal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Import"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hondurasemb.org/preguntas-frecuentes-consulares.html|title=FAQ:What are the requirements to introduce and carry firearms in Honduras?|author=Embassy of Honduras|date=2007-04-15|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A license for every firearm must be obtained and renewed every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/5571|title=Honduras: Domestic Small Arms Control Laws|author=Godnick, William and Helena Vasquez|publisher=GunPolicy.org|date=2012-01-29|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current firearm and ammunition law===
Current private ownership and possession of firearms is regulated under the ''Ley de Control de Armas de Fuego, Municiones, Explosivos y Otros Similares'' (Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencia-seguridad.gob.hn/Transparencia/regulaciones/leyes/09%20LEY%20DE%20CONTROL%20DE%20ARMAS%20DE%20FUEGO.pdf|title=Honduran Congress Bill, ''Firearms, Ammunition and Explosives Law''|author=Honduran Congress|date=2000-06-19|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to the '''right to keep and bear arms''', Title I, Chapter I, Article 4 of the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Material states:
:''It is recognized the right of ownership and possession of firearms to citizens and foreign residents who are in full joy of their civil rights and comply with the requirements established by this Law and its regulations.''

In regard to '''what type of firearms are permitted''', Title II, Chapter I, Article 7 states:
:''For the purpose of this law, it is considered permissible in accordance to current regulation, the following self-defense and recreational weapons:''

# Handguns: Revolvers and semiautomatic handguns up to the point-forty five inches (.45) or eleven-point-five millimeter (11.5mm) caliber;
# Long guns: Rifles and bolt action or semiautomatic carbines up to point-three hundred and eight inches (.308); and
# Bolt action or semiautomatic shotguns of ten (10), twelve (12), sixteen (16), twenty (20)-gauge or point four hundred and ten (.410) caliber so as long as the barrel is greater than forty-six centimeters (46&amp;nbsp;cm) or eighteen (18) inches.

In regard to '''how many firearms a citizen may own''', Title III, Chapter II, Article 27 (as reformed though Decreto 69-2007) states:
:''Every person in exercise of his or her rights as citizen can request a maximum of five (5) licenses to keep and carry up to five (5) firearms, presenting an application with the following:''
# Form with personal information and address,
# Make, model, serial number, identification of modification of caliber, if any; as well as any other characteristics of the weapon,
# Proof of ballistic test,
# Payment of municipal matriculation, and
# Identification documents

In regard to '''where and when firearms may be carried''', Article 27A was amended to the firearms control law and states:
:''The legal carry of a firearm by his owner, either apparent or openly, is only allowed in the spaces of private property such as homes, businesses, workshops, ranches, farms and similar only by their owners.  It is also permitted to openly carry to employees performing duties of surveillance and security in public and private businesses, industrial, of service, agricultural, and private security, and strictly in the assigned places and time of employment, in compliance with the requirements of identification, use of uniforms, and other required by this or other law.''

In regard to the '''transport of firearms''', Article 27A, third paragraph, explains that firearms can be transported on the streets, in public spaces or areas, public transportation and private vehicles when:
:''...the weapon carried by his owner is kept or contained in a case or container that does that permit its immediate use...'' and,
:''...should be kept on the glove compartment or visible storage areas in the vehicle.''

In regard to '''openly carrying firearms in public''', Article 27A, fourth paragraph, states:
:''At no time is permitted to openly carry weapons on the streets, public areas, public transportation vehicles, public institutions or commercial establishments, [of] industrial, of service, recreational, and any other space where people gather, except under the circumstances described on the first paragraph.''

In regard to '''bringing firearms to Honduras''', Article 30 makes the possession of a firearm while in transit through Honduras illegal and requires visitors and tourists who will engage in hunting and shooting sport activities to register and request temporary import permits with the Ministry of Security prior to traveling to Honduras.

=== Automatic weapons ===
Under Article 8 of Title II, Chapter I of the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, [[automatic weapons]] of any kind are forbidden in Honduras, as well as [[suppressor|silencers]] and high-precision guns, such as [[sniper rifle]]s.

=== Assault rifles ===
In response to the high level of crime and violence experienced in Honduras, in 2003, the government passed a law banning several types of military-issue "assault" rifles from private possession. Legislative Power Decree 101-2003 gave a 90-day grace period to surrender all weapons prohibited under Article 8, along with weapons described in the new law, without fear of criminal or civil prosecution and provided an incentive of 1,000 [[Honduran lempira|lempiras]] (US$52.92) per weapon surrendered.

This law pertains to weapons that found their way onto the black market from military channels; by definition, "assault" rifles are illegal in Honduras if they are capable of fully automatic fire or they fall under the make and model or caliber restricted under Article 2 of Decree 101-2003 which states:
 
:''...[[AK-47]] rifle in all its versions.  [[FN FAL]] and [[FN FAL#Argentina|[Argentine] FAP]] [[7.62mm]], [[UZI]] [[sub machine gun]], [[M16 rifle|M-16]] in all its versions, [[M60 machine gun]]. Sniper rifle [[5.56mm]] in all its versions. [[IMI Galil]] rifle, [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]] rifle, [[Beretta AR70/90|Beretta 5.56mm]] in all its versions.  [[M21 Sniper Weapon System|M21]] for sharpshooters, homemade firearms, and other weapons of war the Secretary of State in the Office of Security and National Defense may consider as such.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/juris/Leyes/DECRETO%20101-2003%20ARMAS%20DE%20FUEGO.pdf|title=DECRETO No. 101-2003-|author=Honduran National Congress|publisher=CEDII|date=2003-08-28|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession of any weapon and ammunition as described above carries a sentence of eight to 10 years in prison and a fine of 5,000 to 10,000 lempiras (US$264.62-$529.24).

=== Decreto No. 69-2007 ===
Increasing crime and violence and deaths by firearm has led the government to further restrict the ownership and possession of firearms by private citizens.

Under Decree Number 69-2007, signed into law on June 29, 2007, private citizens were restricted to register only up to five firearms and are no longer permitted to carry their firearms in public unless they are being transported and in the proper manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/juris/Decretos/Decreto%2069%202007%20reforma%20a%20la%20ley%20de%20Control%20de%20Armas%20de%20Fuego,%20Municiones,%20Explosivos%20y%20otros%20similares.pdf|title=DECRETO No. 69-2007-|author=Honduran National Congress|publisher=CEDII|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, firearms cannot be carried on a motorcycle unless the bearer is a law enforcement officer.

[[Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes’s]] moral and political [[philosophy]] is constructed around the basic premise of social and political order, explaining how humans should live in peace under a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power so as to avoid conflict within the ‘[[state of nature]]’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/#SH4d|title=Thomas Hobbes: Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Garrath|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes’s [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]] are intertwined; his moral thought is based around ideas of human nature, which determine the interactions that make up his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes’s moral philosophy therefore provides justification for, and informs, the theories of [[sovereignty]] and the [[state of nature]] that underpin his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In utilising methods of [[deductive reasoning]] and [[wikt:motion|motion]] science, Hobbes examines human emotion, reason and knowledge to construct his ideas of human nature (moral philosophy).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Höffe|first=Otfried|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=2-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology critically influences his politics, determining the interactions of conflict (in the state of nature) which necessitate the creation of a politically authoritative [[State (polity)|state]] to ensure the maintenance of peace and cooperation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its Genesis|last=Strauss|first=Leo|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used and developed in works such as ''The Elements of Law'' (1640), ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) and ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'' (1681).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory|last=Kavka|first=Gregory S.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=7-292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In developing his moral and political philosophy, Hobbes assumes the methodological approach of deductive reasoning, combining mathematics and the [[mechanics]] of science to formulate his ideas on human nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes was critical of the assumptions of scholastic philosophers, whose evidence for human nature was based upon [[Aristotelian metaphysics]] and [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] observation, as opposed to reasoning and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Though Hobbes did not fully reject the value of observational or ‘prudential’ knowledge, he dismissed the view that this was at all scientific or philosophical in nature.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To Hobbes, this type of knowledge was based on subjective and diverse experience, and was therefore only capable of producing speculative assumptions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This view predetermined Hobbes’s method of deductive reasoning, which involved the application of geometry, [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] scientific concepts and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This scientific method stresses the importance of first establishing well-defined principles of human nature (moral philosophy) and ‘deducing’ aspects of political life from this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes first used the mechanics of motion to define principles of human perception, behaviour and reasoning, which were then used to draw the conclusions of his political philosophy (sovereignty, state of nature).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In rejecting what he believed were ‘conjectures’ relating to intangible or supernatural objects or realities, Hobbes’s philosophy is drawn from material and physical reality and experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Otfried Höffe|Höffe]] explains how Hobbes applied this method to construct his political theory of sovereignty:

“…the combination of mathematics and mechanics, is not sufficient on its own… the combination of mathematics and mechanics leads to the metaphor of the state as an “artificial” human being, which is comparable to a machine constructed out of natural human beings; (3) the resoluto-compositive [the recourse to absolutely first principles or elements] method defines and clarifies the nature of this construction: the artificial human being is decomposed into its smallest constituent parts and then recomposed, i.e., constructed, out of these parts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hobbes’s moral principles thus provide the ultimate basis for his political philosophy, defining and clarifying how an “artificial” sovereign authority may come into existence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Moral philosophy ==
Hobbes’s moral philosophy is the fundamental starting point from which his political philosophy is developed. This moral philosophy outlines a general conceptual framework on human nature which is rigorously developed in ''The Elements of Law'', ''De Cive'' and ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These works examine how the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] influence human perception, behaviour and action, which then determine how individuals interact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Elements of Law'' provides insight into Hobbes’s moral philosophy through ideas of sensation, pleasure, passion, pain, memory and reason.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Bunce|first=Robin E. R.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC|year=2009|isbn=|location=London|pages=20-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expanded upon in ''De Cive'': “… human nature… comprising the faculties of body and mind; . . . Physical force, Experience Reason and Passion".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hobbes believes that as sensory organs process the movements of [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimuli]], a range of different mental experiences take place, which in turn dictate human behaviour.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmeth/|title=Thomas Hobbes: Methodology|last=Finn|first=Stephen|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What emerged from this idea of motion was the view that humans are naturally drawn towards, or desire, things that benefit their overall wellbeing; things that are “good” for them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These are called “appetites”, and what differentiates the human ‘appetite’ from that of animals is reason.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reason, or “[[ratiocination]]”, as used by Hobbes, was not defined in the traditional sense as an innate capability tied to notions of [[natural law]], but as an activity that involved coming to a judgement via the process of [[logic]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Humans, as noted in ''Leviathan'', have “…knowledge of the consequences of one affirmation to another”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Individuals will desire and select whatever ‘thing’ brings them the most “good”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This process of thinking is a consequence of motion and mechanics more than a conscious exercise of choice.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ratiocination leads individuals to uncover the [[Natural law|Laws of Nature]], which Hobbes deems “the true moral philosophy”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hobbes’s understanding of human nature establishes the foundations for his political philosophy by explaining the essence of conflict (in the state of nature) and cooperation (in a [[commonwealth]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because human beings will always pursue what is ‘good’ for them, this philosophy asserts that individuals share overarching desires or goals, such as security and safety (especially from death).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is the point in which Hobbes’s moral and political philosophy intersect: in “our shared conception of ourselves as [[Rationality|rational]] agents”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rational to “pursue the necessary means to our dominant shared ends”, in which case the “necessary means” is submission to a sovereign authority.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By establishing morality as a force which directs individuals towards their shared desires and goals of, for example, peace and security, and the means to achieve these goals is through the creation of a state, Hobbes grounds his political philosophy in his moral thought.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This approach to moral philosophy is executed by Hobbes through discussion of a range of interrelated moral concepts: “[[good]], [[evil]], [[rights]], [[obligation]], [[justice]], [[Social contract|contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] and natural law”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Moral concepts ===

==== Obligation ====
Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation stems from the assumption that humans have a fundamental obligation to follow the laws of nature and all obligations stem from nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Leviathan: The Moral and Political Theory of Thomas Hobbes|last=Gauthier|first=David P.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reasoning for this is premised upon the beliefs of natural law; that the moral standards or reasoning that govern behaviour can be drawn from eternal truths regarding human nature and the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes believes that the morals derived from natural law, however, do not permit individuals to challenge the laws of the sovereign; law of the commonwealth supersedes natural law, and obeying the laws of nature does not make you exempt from disobeying those of the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation thus intertwines with the concept of political obligation. This underpins much of Hobbes’s political philosophy, stating that humans have a political obligation or ‘[[duty]]’ to prevent the creation of a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=hobbes-moral|title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|date=|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a political obligation to obey a sovereign power, and once they have renounced part of their [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] to this power (theory of sovereignty), they have a duty to uphold the ‘[[Social contract|social contract’]] they have entered into.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

== Political philosophy ==
[[File:Leviathan_livre.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from the first edition of ''Leviathan'' (1651) which serves as a visual representation of Hobbes's idea of the state. 

The city pictured in the foreground of the image represents civilisation, while the salient figure (Leviathan), with a sword and crosier in hand, personifies sovereignty and the omnipotent state, possessing the authority to represent the collective will of the people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ]]
The main aspects of Hobbes’s political philosophy revolve around the contrasting relationship between the state of nature (a state of war) and the State itself as one of peace and cooperation. This philosophy is determined by, and implied in, his method of deduction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The trajectory of individual desire and [[Will (philosophy)|will]] outlined in his moral philosophy is a decisive factor contributing to the formulation of his idea of the State.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hobbes outlined four key principles of purpose in his philosophical literature:

# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welfare of the general public.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;State of well-being and satisfaction with life.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of justice.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of peace (to avoid the ‘state of war’).&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These concepts are mutually reinforcing and feature across his most prominent works. For example, in ''The Elements of Law'', Hobbes claims that the benefits given to the general public under a commonwealth are “incomparable”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This overlaps with his discussion of justice in the same text, which is used in a political context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Leviathan'' details all four principles but focuses on the pursuit of peace, which Hobbes aligns with the first principle of welfare and public good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Where a state of peace (4) and justice (3), and the overall welfare of the general public (1), manifest under a commonwealth (stemming from ‘[[Common good|commonweal]]’: the general good of the public), a state of well-being and overall satisfaction (2) may be secured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only under the commonwealth (as opposed to a state of nature and war) can peace, and “the notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice”, exist indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is expanded upon again in ''The Elements of Law'', which posits that humans by nature are inclined towards conflict, and therefore need a State to institute peace and protect individuals against the threats of [[self-preservation]] which flourish in a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ''De Cive'' also builds on the relationship between these principles, where Hobbes’s claim to show individuals the “highway to peace” affirms his notion that humans should pursue peace, and therefore justice, in the form of a commonwealth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is in the interest of humans to pursue peace, who have a fundamental obligation to follow the Laws of Nature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

A sovereign power or authority figure - a Leviathan - is needed to translate these Laws of Nature in a “binding and authoritative fashion”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The notion that individuals require a “visible power to keep them in awe” - to maintain peace and safety through enforcement of law - underpins Hobbes’s theory of sovereignty, which proposes that a sovereign ruler (with authority to govern the people) is fundamental to any type of commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbes and the Law of Nature|last=Zagorin|first=Perez|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the overarching concern of Hobbes’s political philosophy remains the capacity of the government to maintain peace, protection, justice and wellbeing in a manner that ensures the continuation of society and [[Civil society|civil life]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children''' is a 1921 [[multilateral treaty]] of the [[League of Nations]] that addressed the problem of international [[Human trafficking|trafficking of women and children]].

==Background==
The growth of the social [[reform movement]] during the late 19th century gave momentum to international efforts by [[women's rights]] groups, [[social hygiene]] activists, and others, to address trafficking in women and children and its role in prostitution and [[exploitation of labour|labour exploitation]]. Previous international conventions had been ratified by 34 countries in 1901 and 1904,{{sfn|Nitzka|1999|pages=75–6}} and 1910 as "[[International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic|Convention for Suppression of White Slave Trade]]". The [[League of Nations]], formed in 1919, quickly became the organization coordinating international efforts to study and attempt to end the practice.

==League of Nations==
When it was established, the [[League of Nations]] at first did not include women's rights groups, who protested their exclusion and canvassed politicians for support. Ultimately, United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and France's Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] supported the participation of [[women's rights]] groups, who they argued were best suited to give a voice to women's issues. The League held the [[International Conference on White Slave Traffic]] in 1921, and agreed on the ''1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children'' on 30 September 1921.{{sfn|Nitzka|1999|page=75}}

In 1933, it passed the ''[[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age]]''.

==Key contents==
The 1921 Convention ensure that protection from trafficking and sexual exploitation on the international level. The Article 6 states that "The High Contracting Parties agree, in case they have not already taken licensing and supervision of employment agencies and offices, to prescribe such regulations as are required to ensure the protection of women and children seeking employment in another country." and the Article 7 to "undertake in connection with immigration and emigration adopt such administrative and legislative measures as are required to check the traffic in women and children. In particular, they undertake to make such regulations as are required for the protection of women and children travelling on emigrant ships, not only at the points of departure and arrival, but also during the journey and to arrange for the exhibition, in railway stations and imports of notices warning women and children of the traffic and indicating the places where they can obtain accommodation and assistance."

==Impact==
The 1921 Convention set new goals for international efforts to stem human trafficking, primarily by giving the anti-trafficking movement further official recognition, as well as a bureaucratic apparatus to research and fight the problem. The Advisory Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children was a permanent advisory committee of the League. Its members were nine countries, and several [[non-governmental organizations]]. An important development was the implementation of a system of annual reports of member countries. Member countries formed their own centralized offices to track and report on trafficking of women and children.{{sfn|Nitzka|1999|page=76}}

The advisory committee also worked to expand its research and intervention program beyond the United States and Europe. In 1929, a need to expand into the Near East (Asia Minor), the Middle East, and Asia were acknowledged. An international conference of central authorities in Asia was planned for 1937, but no further action was taken during the late 1930s.{{sfn|Nitzka|1999|page=77}}

==Reservations==
To this 1921 Convention, some nations declare [[reservation (law)|reservations]]; inter alia, Australia, [[British Empire]], Japan, Spain and [[New Zealand]] reserve the application to the colonies, [[protectorate]] and [[mandated territory|mandated territories]]; [[India]], Japan and [[Thailand]] reserve the Article 5 on limitation of age under 21 years old.

==Subsequent international law==
The League of Nations disbanded with [[World War II]], and was succeeded by the United Nations. The 1921 Convention thereby was replaced by the ''1947 Protocol to amend the 1921 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children'', legislation tabled by the [[United Nations Secretary General]] on 12 November 1947. The 1947 Protocol was ultimately ratified by 46 countries. This Protocol was superseded by the ''[[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]'' (1949) whose Preamble recalls the 1921 Convention together with "1910 Convention for Suppression of White Slave Traffic", and "1933 Convention on the Suppression of Traffic of Women of Full Age", again tabled by the United Nations Secretary-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1947/1921-international-convention-for-the-suppression-of-the-traffic-in-women-and-children-as-amended-by-the-1947-protocol/|title=1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children, as amended by the 1947 Protocol|publisher=Centre for International Law, National University of Singapore|accessdate=12 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110120011/http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1947/1921-international-convention-for-the-suppression-of-the-traffic-in-women-and-children-as-amended-by-the-1947-protocol/|archivedate=10 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13546">'''International legal personality''' is an important facet of [[international law]] that has developed throughout history as a means of international representation. With the acquirement of personality comes privileges and responsibilities. Personality has been given to states, [[corporations]], [[non-governmental organizations]], [[international organizations]], and individuals{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

== International law ==
Rules made by states for states is the basis of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Legal Personality|url=http://www.humanrights.is/en/human-rights-education-project/human-rights-concepts-ideas-and-fora/human-rights-actors/international-legal-personality|website=Icelandic Human Rights Centre|publisher=Icelandic Human Rights Centre|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; International law governs states and their relationships with one another. Historically it was believed that states were the only actors in international law and therefore other entities were merely the responsibility of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aufricht|first1=Hans|title=Personality in International Law|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=April 1943|volume=37|issue=2|pages=217–243|jstor=1949384|doi=10.2307/1949384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics ==
Gaining international legal personality is often a goal of international actors. By gaining personality, they gain acknowledgment in the international legal community. The amount of personality that an international actor has depends entirely upon state recognition. Legal personality can determine the rights that actors have as well as their standings with courts. As personality is given by states, it stands to reason that international actors are only effective when states allow them to be.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charnovitz|first1=Steve|title=NonGovernmental Organizations and International Law|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=2006|volume=100|issue=2|pages=348–372|jstor=3651151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without the approval of states, other actors have no rights nor any true ability in the international arena. One question that critics of the effectiveness of legal personality ask is if “personality contain[s] any inherent legal capacity to act?”&lt;ref name=Hickey&gt;{{cite web|last1=HIckey|first1=James E.|title=The Source of International Legal Personality in the Twenty First Century|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?|website=Hofstra Law and Policy Symposium|accessdate=1 May 2015}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality is a concept with many blurred areas but must be grasped to understand the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of international actors. Entities that are capable of being granted personality and thus being subjects of international law are those with the capacity to act within the international arena.&lt;ref name=Udeariry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Udeariry|first1=Naomi Chigozi|title=To What Extent do International Organizations Possess International Legal Personality?|date=15 Sep 2011|pages=1–7|ssrn=2052555|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entities that are candidates for international legal personality include corporations, companies, sovereign states, international organizations, and individuals.&lt;ref name=Shukalo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukalo|first1=Nemanja|title=What is International Legal Personality and Why Does it Matter?|date=2011|location=Nicosia|pages=1–5|url=https://www.academia.edu/1220009/What_is_International_Legal_Personality_and_why_does_it_matter|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These entities should have legal powers, the ability to effectively exercise their powers, and associations with states on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name=Shukalo/&gt;

== History ==
Until the expansion of [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in the 20th century, legal personality was not given to non-state actors commonly, if ever. Once these entities became actors, they were not ordinarily given personality unless granted by the state in a legal statute or treaty. Typically international organizations, NGOs, and corporations were seen as groups of individuals and were viewed as recipients of international law, rather than actors on the international stage.&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; However NGOs especially have increasingly begun to play important roles in international politics and policy making over the last several decades.&lt;ref name=Bernau&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernau|first1=B.M|title=Help for hotspots: NGO participation in the preservation of worldwide biodiversity|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|date=2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=617–643|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/236648387?accountid=26218|accessdate=1 May 2015|doi=10.2979/gls.2006.13.2.617}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear when NGOs truly began to play a role in international politics, but the first notice of groups influencing the international policy making occurred in 1826.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; In 1911, these groups began to grow and amass attention and in 1919 Dwight W. Morrow began using “NGO” as a term.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; By 1943 scholars of several disciplines were referring to these groups of influence as NGOs.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; After formal recognition by the UN, NGOs were able to truly interact in the international arena.&lt;ref name=Olz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olz|first1=Martin A|title=Non Governmental Organizations in Regional Human Rights Systems|journal=Colombia Human Rights Law Review|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting international personality has historically been an obstacle for NGOs. 1910 saw the first convention to grant legal personality, and in 1936 Charles Fenwick is quoted with saying that NGO representation “might be greatly effective in cutting across national lines.”&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; In response to changes in world policies, the approaches taken to obtain and grant international legal personality have seen several changes.&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; These changes have resulted in and will continue to result in variations and challenges to the sources of international legal personality and the roles that other international actors play. States were the first to gain international legal personality, followed by [[non-state actors]] (such as [[MNCs]] and [[NGOs]]) and individuals.&lt;ref name=Shukalo/&gt; The 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations established the definition of an international organization. The definition excluded non governmental organizations and established the concept of legal personality.&lt;ref name=Udeariry/&gt;

== Personality: privileges and rights ==
Rights that come with obtaining international legal personality include the right to enter into [[treaties]], right to [[immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]], right to send and receive [[legations]], and the right to bring international claims to obtain reparation for damages.&lt;ref name=Udeariry/&gt; Those who have international legal personality can sue and be sued, can enter into [[contracts]], can incur debt, and pay various taxes.&lt;ref name=Udeariry/&gt; NGOs with personality are able to participate directly with international bodies and organizations created by legislation and treaties. They are given the ability to fund a cause rather than ask for funding for a cause. They are even given certain legal rights and protections.&lt;ref name=Olz/&gt; NGOs that are parties of a treaty can file for wrongdoings. NGOs with personality can eventually gain representative status on international councils and assemblies.&lt;ref name=Bernau/&gt; Some NGOs, such as Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have been given rights that governments usually give to IOs.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; NGOs are not held back by things such as political parties and reelections, they are simply allowed to lobby for what they think is the best choice. This freedom is typically found only in NGOs. This freedom gives NGOs a type of flexibility and efficiency that, once again, other international actors don’t process. More energy is bound to arise from an NGO rather than an IGO, as NGOs are voluntary commitments.&lt;ref name=Charnovitz/&gt; The people within an NGO are dedicated to their cause and are more likely to work harder to get things done.&lt;ref name=Bernau/&gt; NGOs are also able to act beyond the realm of sovereignty in a way that governments and their organizations cannot do. Once an NGO reaches [[consultative status]], they are able to do even more. Consultative NGOs are able to receive official documents, attend meetings of various councils, be consulted by a Secretary General or committee, and participate in hearings in various ways.&lt;ref name=Olz/&gt;

== Obtaining international legal personality ==
There are theories to consider when deciding how international legal personality should be applied and from where the power comes.

=== Legal Traditionalist approach ===
The Legal Traditionalist Approach is one such method. In this way of thinking, one would believe that international legal personality must be explicitly transmitted from states to actors via some legal instrument. Without this transfer, an actor has no standing. In this approach, states are viewed as the ultimate international actors and the only source for personality.

=== Factual Realist approach ===
Directly opposite of this approach is the Factual Realist Approach. This method of thinking outlines global integration as the source of international legal personality rather than states. Factual realists would assume that states will eventually cease to be the source of personality for NGOs as globalization and [[transculturation]] occur.

=== Dynamic State approach ===
The Dynamic State Approach falls rather nicely between the two latter approaches. Basically a halfway point between Factual Realism and Legal Traditionalism, this approach finds the source of personality for actors lies within international treaties or customs. Dynamic State Approach theorists would claim that while legal traditionalists lean too much towards preserving international law through tradition, factual realists tend to disregard the customs and traditions of international law.&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt;

=== Historical approach: United Nations Nationals ===
The [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]] - Article 78 provides the basis and application of International Legal Personalities within [[Customary international law]] to each and every human being on (and off) Earth:

:Article 78
:"United Nations nationals" means individuals who are nationals of any of the United Nations, or corporations or associations organised under the laws of any of the United Nations, at the coming into force of the present Treaty, provided that the said individuals, corporations or associations also had this status on September 3, 1943, the date of the Armistice with Italy.
:The term "United Nations nationals" also includes all individuals, corporations or associations which, under the laws in force in Italy during the war, have been treated as enemy;

The application of International Legal Personalities upon all human beings is real and actionable as UN Nationals since 1947.  In effect, the UN is the single global issuer of legal personalities for all Member-States.  As the UN is the source, transfer of personalities between states becomes trivial.  Moving a UN National called a Mexican into the United States is technically immaterial; as US Citizens are also UN Nationals equally.  A US Citizen legal presence/instrument is merely a specialized UN National international legal personality.  To a UN National, the border between countries is a trivial separation between UN economic zones. 

The UN globalized all Member-States' personalities under one organization, a global government of governments.  With all UN Member-States receiving their personalities from the UN, legally, there is only one single global government with one single global citizenship as the United Nations.  

The full set of privileges (legally framed as "rights") for UN National International Legal Personalities is the UN [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  This is important because, for instance, various countries Constitutions do not apply to UN Nationals except through the UN UDHR even within what people believe to be their own home country.

[[CERN]]'s Code of Conduct is copyright by the International Monetary Fund (under the United Nations) and the CERN vehicle license plates ("CD") are issued under the [[Corps Diplomatique]]; This indicates that CERN also uses UN National International Legal Personalities for international recognition as well.

== ''United Kingdom v. Costa Rica'' (1923) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}

=== Facts ===
The former government of [[Costa Rica]], known as the Ticono Regime, was said to have given oil concession to a British company. The new government of Costa Rica needed to acknowledge the action. The [[United Kingdom]] disagreed, as it had already been granted.

=== Questions ===
*"Does a government need to conform to a previous constitution if the government had established itself and maintained a peaceful ''de facto'' administration?"

*"Does non-recognition of a government by other governments destroy the ''de facto'' status of the government?"

=== Ruling ===
There is no need to conform to a previous constitution in such an instance. Non-recognition of the government by other governments delegitimises the status of the government.

'''Ivan Ivanovich Yanzhul''' (Иван Иванович Янжул; 1846-1914) was a professor of [[financial law]] at [[Moscow University]] who established the Russian state [[factory inspection]]. He helped enforce the [[Labour law in the Russian Empire|first Russian labour code]] (1 June 1882) which provided a measure of protection for Russian factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Giffin. ''I. I. Yanzhul, Russia's First District Factory Inspector.'' // The Slavonic and East European Review. Vol. 49, No 114, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; His job involved finding an industrial enterprise, gaining access to the premises and forcing the owner to halt illegal practices such as night [[child labor]]. His political views have been described as [[state socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences''. Macmillan Co., 1957. Vol. 15. Page 512.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanzhul was elected into the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1895. His [[memoirs]] were published in 2 volumes in 1910 and 1911.

The '''Legal Writing Institute''' (LWI) is an American non-profit organization "dedicated to improving [[legal writing]] by providing a forum for discussion and scholarship about legal writing, analysis, and research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwionline.org/ Legal Writing Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;  LWI maintains several resources for its members including a national conference held every two years, annual surveys, a database of teaching materials, and committee projects.  The LWI also supports conferences in other countries and conferences in specialty topics such as rhetoric and legal storytelling.

The LWI is housed at [[Mercer University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AALS Section on Legal Writing, Reasoning, and Research|publisher=[[Louisiana State University]]|url=http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/aals/Funding%20and%20Awards.htm|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members include legal writing professors,  attorneys, and judges from around the world.

The LWI was established as an offshoot of the first conference concerning Legal Writing in law schools held at the [[University of Puget Sound]] in 1984.  The conference was partially funded by money left over from a National Endowment for the Humanities grant procured by Christopher Rideout, an English Professor at the University of Puget Sound.  Laurel Currie Oates, who was a Professor of Legal Writing at the University of Puget Sound, helped organize this initial conference that 108 writing professionals attended.  The concept of LWI reached fruition in 1985 when the [[Association of American Law Schools]] held a conference in [[Chicago]] and brought together numerous leaders in the legal writing field. The LWI was incorporated in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Mary S. Lawrence, The Legal Writing Institute, "The Beginning: Extraordinary Vision, Extraordinary Accomplishment", 11 ''J.L.W.I.'' 213 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

 are some of the [[warez group]]s  – groups of individuals proficient at ripping films, music, or other media, as well as those who can [[Reverse engineering#Reverse engineering of software|reverse engineer]] and [[Software cracking|crack]] the digital rights management (DRM) measures applied to commercial software – that have attained a level of notoriety, with an introduction of when they were formed and their achievements. According to research, between 2003 and 2009 there were 3,164 active groups, with the majority of these groups being active for no more than two months, with only a small amount being active for many years. The [[warez scene]] is a very competitive and volatile environment. Groups are generally not driven by profit, but by reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Il a piraté les pirates informatiques |first=Marie |last=Lambert-Chan |date=2013-04-21 |url=http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/recherche/sciences-sociales-psychologie/20130422-il-a-pirate-les-pirates-informatiques.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups==
===3DM===
{{main|3DM}}
3DM is a Chinese video game cracking group, "one of the world's biggest" according to ''[[Kotaku]]''. Their founder and leader is reported to be a woman using the pseudonym "Bird Sister" (simplified Chinese: 宿菲菲; pinyin: Sù Fēifēi). Unusual for piracy groups, 3DM's members have public profiles on the social network [[Sina Weibo]], and use a blog to inform the public about their activities.

3DM were one of the first groups to offer cracks for games which utilized DRM produced by [[Denuvo]]. As newer versions of Denuvo DRM became more challenging to reverse engineer, 3DM gave up trying to crack games with Denuvo DRM.

In 2016 the group claimed that piracy of games produced by large developers and publishers would be impossible in the coming years, due to the technological challenges of reverse engineering and ultimately cracking the [[virtualization]] and licensing schemes employed by new DRM solutions like Denuvo. One of the most notable groups on the web at the time, they publicly announced a year hiatus from developing cracks for games. Since returning in 2017, 3DM have only released games which use [[Steam (software)|Steam]] licensing, only releasing copies of better protected games which include cracks made by other groups. This practice has been criticized by the groups whose cracks were included in releases under the 3DM name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://layer13.net/rls?id=7907030|title=WRC.6.FIA.WORLD.RALLY.CHAMPIONSHIP-STEAMPUNKS|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACTiVATED===
ACTiVATED is a warez group and is affiliated with CODEX. ACTiVATED is known for cracking games for Linux and [[macOS]].

===Centropy===
{{main article|Centropy}}
Centropy, founded in January 1999, was a warez group which specialized in releasing copies of films, many of which were still in theatres. Touting many "[[Zero-day warez|0-day]]" releases and releases prior to commercial availability, Centropy released and pre-released numerous films.

===CLASS===
{{main article|CLASS (warez)}}
CLASS (also known as ''CLS'') was a warez group which was the target of federal raids such as [[Operation Fastlink]]. They were a global group with members worldwide, often releasing game "rips". The group ceased operations in 2004 after their 1,234th release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/class |title=Class |publisher=Defacto2 |date=1997-01-08 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}{{Self-published source|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CODEX===
CODEX (also known as ''CDX'') – is a warez group founded at the end of January 2014. They are known for releasing copies of games which use [[Steam (software)|Steam]] licensing and also for emulating [[Ubisoft|Ubisoft's]] [[Uplay]] [[Digital rights management|DRM]] protection.

From 2016 to 2018 they have been one of the most active warez groups releasing commercial computer games. In late 2017 CODEX gained notoriety by becoming the third scene group (and fifth overall entity) to crack Denuvo DRM when they released a cracked version of ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'' on its release date.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://layer13.net/rls?id=8111727|title=Details for [0DAY] Middle.Earth.Shadow.of.War-CODEX  {{!}} Layer13.net|last=g2x3k|website=layer13.net|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CODEX collaborated with STEAMPUNKS on at least one game which used Denuvo DRM, [[South Park: The Fractured but Whole|South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], which they released under the name "CODEPUNKS". In February 2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games from the Microsoft [[Windows Store]].&lt;ref name="UWPCRACKED"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirates-crack-microsofts-uwp-protection-five-layers-of-drm-defeated-180215/|website=torrentfreak.com|title=Pirates Crack Microsoft's UWP Protection, Five layers of DRM Defeated|date=February 15, 2018|publisher=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12th June 2018 CODEX released a crack emulator for [[Forza Horizon 3]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/8qmg8q/forzahorizon3codex/|title=r/CrackWatch - Forza.Horizon.3-CODEX|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later turned out to be a generic Windows Store licensing API emulator for most games using the Windows Store DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/8qru7l/forza_motorsport_7_accidental_crack_codex_by_mnsxx/|title=Forza Motorsport 7 Accidental Crack - CODEX by MnSXx • r/CrackWatch|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/8r03j1/recoredefinitiveeditionmercs213/|title=r/CrackWatch - ReCore.Definitive.Edition-mercs213|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In mid-2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games featuring the latest versions of Denuvo DRM, including updated versions of [[Assassin's Creed Origins]] and [[Far Cry 5]], both of which used [[Uplay]] licensing DRM and contained additional anti-modification and anti-debugging code through the use of [[VMProtect]].

===CONSPIR4CY===
[[File:CPY-NFO.png|thumb|223x223px|One of the nfo files used by the warez group named "CPY"]]
''CONSPIR4CY'' (releasing mostly as ''CPY'') is a warez group founded in 1999 in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pastebin.com/WzK49sT5|title=ÛÛÛ                                                                 - Pastebin.com|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pastebin.com/9E3FyX3Z|title=ÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛ²²²²²²²²²²²²²²±±±±±±±±±   - Pastebin.com|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rose in notoriety after releasing ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]] and'' ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]'' in August 2016 under the name of ''CONSPIR4CY'', though they resumed using the 'CPY' tag shortly thereafter with the release of their cracked copy of ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'' in September 2016. They became the first group to create proper cracks for games protected by the third iteration [[Denuvo]] DRM software. They cracked ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' only five days after its release, at the time the shortest amount of time taken to develop a crack for a Denuvo DRM-protected game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/game-pirates-celebrate-fall-of-denuvos-brand-new-protection-170414/ |title=Game Pirates Celebrate Fall of Denuvo's Brand New Protection |author=Andy |date=2017-04-14 |website=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cracked ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsogaming.com/news/despite-the-denuvo-anti-tamper-tech-mass-effect-andromeda-has-been-cracked-in-10-days/|title=Despite the Denuvo anti-tamper tech, Mass Effect: Andromeda has been cracked in 10 days|first=John|last=Papadopoulos|website=DSOGaming|date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; only ten days after its release. In July 2017 the warez group SKIDROW criticized the methods used by CONSPIR4CY to crack games using Denuvo DRM.&lt;ref name="SKIDROW 10 YEAR NOTES"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074449/https://layer13.net/rls?id=7939346 |title=SKIDROW 10 YEAR NOTES |date=2017-07-04 |author=SKIDROW}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2018, CPY released cracked copies of ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', which were compiled with the most recent version of Denuvo DRM, and had additional anti-modification and anti-debugging features through the use of [[VMProtect]] software and [[EasyAntiCheat]]. In November 2018 CPY released cracks for ''[[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|HITMAN 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', ''[[A Way Out (video game)|A Way Out]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Tomb Raider]]'',  ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 2019]]'' and ''[[FIFA 19]]'' - all of which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM, with some using additional custom DRM or off the shelf DRM such as EACore and VMProtect.

===DEViANCE===
Active from 1999 to 2006, DEViANCE was one of the most prolific warez groups. Their dissolution has been described as the end of an era, and the current affiliation of ex-DEViANCE members is a reoccurring argument between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ViTALiTY accuses HATRED of being ex-Deviance|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/ad34a4|website=defacto2|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defacto2.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=DevSuc rants about the current DEVIANCE|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/ac2bb4|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoodlum rebuts RLD's claims of being ex-DEViANCE leaders|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/af3c5e|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing members of a modern warez group as ex-DEViANCE became something of a joke within the warez scene.

===DrinkOrDie===
{{main article|DrinkOrDie}}
DrinkOrDie (also known as ''DoD'') members were targeted by law enforcement in raids stemming from [[Operation Buccaneer]].

===Echelon===
{{main article|Echelon (warez)}}
Echelon was a warez group which specialized in the release and distribution of [[video game console|console]] games, such as [[Dreamcast]] [[ISO image|ISO]]s.

===REVOLT===
REVOLT gained popularity for creating solutions for cracked games to have working multiplayer features, and later for cracks of games using Denuvo DRM which were released by its founder. REVOLT was founded by a Bulgarian teenager, who used the online handle Voksi. In July 2018 the REVOLT website began redirecting to the website of the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/infamous-denuvo-cracker-disappears-site-diverts-to-government-portal-180725/|title=Infamous Denuvo Cracker Disappears, Site Diverts to Government Portal (Updated) - TorrentFreak|date=2018-07-25|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Voksi, then in his twenties, reported having been raided by Bulgarian law enforcement in response to a complaint filed by [[Denuvo]] parent company [[Irdeto]].

===Risciso===
{{main article|Risciso}}

Risciso (stylized as ''RISCISO'') was an online warez group, founded in approximately 1993, dedicated to distributing newly released copyrighted software, games and movies.

===SKIDROW===
SKIDROW is a well-known cracking group originally formed in 1990, cracking games for the [[Amiga]] platform, and having used the motto "Twice the Fun - Double the Trouble!" since then. A piece of [[cracktro]] software released by SKIDROW in 1992 with the game 10 Pinball Fantasies contained a complete list of their membership at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afCSDm8t70w&amp;spfreload=|title=Skid Row - Pinball Fantasies - Amiga Cracktro (50 FPS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most recent incarnation of SKIDROW began releasing unauthorized copies of games in June 2007, when they announced their return to cracking software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skid Row officially announce their return to the PC|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/ac304c|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were the first [[Warez scene|Scene]] group to crack the version of Ubisoft's [[Uplay]] DRM which required players to have a persistent Internet connection to Ubisoft's licensing servers, first in [[Assassin's Creed II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yam|first1=Marcus|title=Ubisoft's DRM for Assassin's Creed II is Cracked|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/assassins-creed-crack-hack-drm-ac2,10260.html|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in [[Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands]].

The group has released cracks for [[Denuvo|Denuvo Anti-Tamper]] protected games, [[Yesterday Origins]] and [[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided#Downloadable content|Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - A Criminal Past]]. It is believed the former had a bad implementation of Denuvo which made it easier to reverse engineer, mostly due to a lack of support from Denuvo for protecting games written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and specifically games using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity game engine]], with this lack of support having been previously demonstrated by an anonymous independent cracker having developed a crack for [[Syberia 3]], which also used Unity. The crack for the latter was actually determined to be a modified [[executable file]] from the game [[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided#Development|Deus Ex: Breach]], a free game which did not incorporate Denuvo's software, released by the same developers and utilizing the same engine, which had been modified slightly to load the assets from Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. A plurality of SKIDROW's current releases are cracked versions of games that make use of [[Steam (software)|Steam]] licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-company-pirates-deus-ex-in-controversial-experiment-111010/ |title=Anti-Piracy Company Pirates Deus Ex in Controversial Experiment |date=2011-10-10 |author=enigmax}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, in a statement released to commemorate their 10th consecutive year of releases since re-emerging in the PC game cracking scene, SKIDROW made cryptic remarks that the techniques used by CONSPIR4CY, STEAMPUNKS, and members of the Steam Underground warez forum to crack modern copy protections are not proper.&lt;ref name="SKIDROW 10 YEAR NOTES"/&gt; These criticisms were themselves criticized on the web, as SKIDROW's apparent standards for a proper crack would seemingly disqualify both their most notable crack of Ubisoft's persistent online connection requiring DRM, which they emulated, and their most recent notable release of a Denuvo-protected game, which they cracked by modifying the executable from another game.

===Steam Underground===
While not precisely a group, the community centered around the Steam Underground web forum and its members have been a notable source of warez development, releases, tools, tutorials, discussions, and information pertinent to other groups since at least 2008. The forum has both Russian and English language boards, and is the home to a number of projects primarily focused on cracking, emulating, and otherwise extending the capabilities of [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and games released on Steam. Games on other platforms may also be discussed on their own board.

The Steam Underground forums are auxiliary to the warez scene, however the formal and informal collaboration between its users arguably constitutes a warez group. Members of Steam Underground have individually and collectively cracked games featuring DRM schemes such as the version of Ubisoft's [[Uplay#Digital rights management|Uplay]] which required players to maintain a persistent Internet connection to their licensing servers, Steam Custom Executable Generation, [[Arxan Technologies|Arxan Anti-Tamper]], [[Denuvo]] Anti-Tamper, and more - both generic digital distribution licensing schemes as well as custom protection, such as the copy protection triggers implemented by game developer [[Croteam]] in [[The Talos Principle]]. Tools and techniques released on the forums have been used to make multiplayer game modes accessible in cracked copies of games, usually enabling pirates to play with other pirates. The cracker known as Baldman released the vast majority of his cracks for [[Denuvo]]-protected games on Steam Underground. A Bulgarian hacker known as Voksi used the Steam Underground forums as a point of distribution for cracks of games with advanced virtual machines, such as Denuvo. In early 2018, Voksi, in collaboration with another Steam Underground user and with material support a member of Chinese cracking group 3DM, began releasing cracks for previously uncracked games and updated builds of titles which utilized Denuvo DRM. Voksi alleged in July 2018, after his personal site began redirecting to a Bulgarian government site, that he was raided by Bulgarian law enforcement at the behest of Denuvo's parent company. This parent company claimed responsibility for the law enforcement inquiry into Voksi in a press release.

The forum and its members have often been referenced as some variation of "the Russian site/forum"&lt;ref name="SKIDROW 10 YEAR NOTES"/&gt; or directly by name&lt;ref name="Oddworld SKIDROW"&gt;http://nfomation.net/info/1293027426.Oddworld.The.Oddboxx-SKIDROW.nfo&lt;/ref&gt; by [[warez scene]] groups in statements which mention the site. At least one prominent member of the forum has been in contact with warez scene release group members, as they published several non-public cracks for [[The Sims 4]] which they attributed to tools or methods obtained from the cracking group RELOADED. This individual was the given access or knowledge related to EA's Origin licensing scheme and DRM, as they began to release their own cracks for updated versions of The Sims 4 based on the same cracking technique.

===STEAMPUNKS===
STEAMPUNKS released unauthorized copies of games which utilized [[Denuvo]] digital rights management solutions in 2017, with their first releases being copies of [[Dishonored 2]], [[ADR1FT]], [[Planet Coaster]], and [[Abzû (video game)|ABZU]]. Releases by STEAMPUNKS include a license generator which creates a valid [[Device fingerprint|hardware ID-based]] license file. These licenses appear to be identical to those generated by the web-based activation servers operated by Denuvo, and they do not trigger Denuvo's DRM copy protection. This method attracted some attention upon its debut, while license generators and "keymakers" were fairly common in commercial software piracy, they had fallen out of use in cracking games as most games moved to the license management capabilities provided by Steam and other digital distribution platforms. One negative reaction to STEAMPUNKS' license maker came from the warez group SKIDROW in a statement from the group released in July 2017.&lt;ref name="SKIDROW 10 YEAR NOTES"/&gt; In late September 2017, STEAMPUNKS became the first warez group to release cracked copies of Denuvo DRM-protected games within 24 hours of their commercial availability, releasing both [[Total War: Warhammer II]] and [[FIFA 18]] on the same day they were made available for consumers. STEAMPUNKS collaborated with CODEX to crack [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]] upon its release, with the cracked release appearing under the [[portmanteau]] group name "CODEPUNKS". Following this and one other collaborative release, STEAMPUNKS became inactive, while CODEX continued to publish cracked versions of games.

===Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated===
{{main article|Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated}}
Tristar and Red Sector, Inc. (also known as ''TRSI'') began as an alliance between two warez groups: Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated. They were formed in 1990 as a cooperative [[Commodore 64]] demo coding and cracking group. TRSI migrated from the Commodore 64 release platform to the Amiga and IBM-PC, and eventually branched off into the console gaming scene before finally disbanding their warez division. In late 2003, TRSI became inactive and remains so today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trsi.org |title=TRSi.DE :: TRiSTAR &amp; RED SECTOR iNC. – Home of the homeless sceners :: since 1990 |publisher=Trsi.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|reason=Citation is to a redirect to group's own website.|date=March 2013}}

===United Software Association===
{{main article|United Software Association}}
The United Software Association (also known as ''USA'') was a prominent IBM PC games and applications warez group during the 1990s. USA formed an alliance with the PC warez division of Fairlight which was known as "USA/FLT". In late January 1992, several members of USA were arrested by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] police for [[credit card fraud]].

===VACE===
VACE was founded in September 2003, and focused on cracking and ripping PC games. Besides ripped games, the group also releases [[Trainer (games)|trainers]].

===ViTALiTY===
ViTALiTY (also known as VTY) was founded in May 2005. It has been suggested they were former members of DEViANCE.&lt;ref name="defacto2.net"/&gt; The group was considered blacklisted by many in the warez scene in October 2007,&lt;ref name="Fairlight bag out Vitality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairlight bag out Vitality|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/ae3400|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt; something ViTALiTY claims was orchestrated by rival groups RELOADED&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitality give 9 separate reasons why they believe Reloaded has it in for them|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/a526ae|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FAiRLiGHT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitality respond to their recent scene ban, that was probably pushed by Fairlight.|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/b2493c|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the latter claim they were against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairlight reneges their ban on Vitality|url=https://defacto2.net/file/detail/b3441c|website=defacto2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ViTALiTY was accused of either reporting or threatening to report members of other groups to the FBI,&lt;ref name="Fairlight bag out Vitality"/&gt; though ViTALiTY claimed a senior member of RELOADED threatened to do the same to them.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; ViTALiTY's last release was an update to [[The Sims 3]] on 8 October 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Mandated choice''' or '''mandatory choice''' is an approach to public policy questions in which people are required by law to state in advance whether or not they are willing to engage in a particular action.  The approach contrasts with "opt-in" and "opt-out" ("presumed consent") models of policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2008/10/27/remedying-donor-organ-complications-91466-22122353/ Remedying donor organ complications]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach has most frequently been applied to cadaveric organ donation,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Susan.  Two Steps to Three Choices: A New Approach to Mandated Choice, ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics'' (1999), 8 : 340-347 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; but has increasingly been considered for [[advance directives]] as well.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-ultimate-prescription_b_247558.html The Ultimate Prescription: Make Us Decide How We Want To Die], July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One bioethicist, in advocating for a mandatory choice model for [[living wills]], argues that "while all Americans should have a right to decide how they want their lives to end, it does not follow that they should be able to avoid confronting such a choice."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==History==

One of the first considerations of mandated choice appeared in [[Great Britain]]'s Gore Report, a 1989-1990 study funded by the British Department of Health. From 2011 all those applying for or renewing driving licences online in the UK are required to state whether they wished to donate their organs.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donated 'nudge' for drivers in new DVLA process, BBC, July 31, 2011 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14341553, accessed July 31, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed a mandated choice model for organ donation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taking organs without asking, Chicago Tribune, July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicalities==
It has been suggested that individuals could be compelled to choose as part of tax returns, driver's licence applications, and/or state benefits claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==

A 1992 survey found that 90% of American college students favored a mandated choice model for organ donation, compared with only 60% who favored presumed consent.&lt;ref&gt;Spital, Aaron.  Mandated Choice:  The Preferred Solution to the Organ Shortage?  ''Arch Intern Med''. 1992;152(12):2421-2424.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Texas implemented such a program, requiring drivers to make a choice on organ donation when obtaining licenses, and found that 80% of drivers declined to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Gina.  Families Are Barriers to Many Organ Donations, Study Finds.  ''The New York Times'', July 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic debate==
Chouhan and Draper propose a modified scheme of mandated choice, in which though all patients are given a choice whether to donate they are actively encouraged to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable [[energy]] management in the [[wastewater]] sector applies the concept of [[sustainable management]] to the energy involved in the treatment of wastewater. The energy used by the wastewater sector is usually the largest portion of energy consumed by the urban water and wastewater utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeHaas|first=David|date=November 2015|title=WASTEWATER TREATMENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY|url=http://www.watercentre.org/awa-journal-november-2015-article/|journal=Australian Water Association Journal|volume=November 2015|pages=53–58|via=International Water Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising costs of electricity, the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions of the energy sector and the growing need to mitigate global warming, are driving wastewater utilities to rethink their energy management, adopting more energy efficient technologies and processes and investing in on-site renewable energy generation.

== Importance ==
Among the water and wastewater services of a city, wastewater treatment is usually the most energy intense process.&lt;ref&gt;Cook S., Hall M., Gregory A. (2012). Energy use in the provision and consumption of urban water in Australia: an update. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, Australia. Prepared for the Water Services Association of Australia. A. P. f. t. W. S. A. o. A. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, [[CSIRO]].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wastewater treatment plants are designed with the purpose of treating the influent sewage to a set quality before discharging it back into a water body, without real concern for the energy consumption of the treating units of a plant. These facilities play the important role to protect not only the water systems but also the human health, preventing the discharge of pathogens normally present in the municipal sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery|last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Tchobanoglous G., Stensel H. D., Tsuchihashi R., Burton F. L.|first=|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the key role of wastewater facilities, energy consumption can not be ignored anymore because of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce the emissions to mitigate global warming, as established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1997 and most recently, by the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2016). Paris Agreement. United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is uncertainty concerning energy costs. Because for a wastewater utility energy costs represent the second highest cost after labour,&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Claudia. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; an increase in energy rate would further increase the operational budget of a municipality, and consequently, the service rates for consumers. 
 
Therefore, it is important for the wastewater sector to invest in strategies to limit the demand of energy from the grid in order to mitigate both costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

== Global challenges ==
[[Population growth]], [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], [[climate change]] and increasing demand for [[natural resource]]s are among the future biggest challenges for the urban wastewater sector.

=== Population growth and urbanisation ===
World population and population density in urban settlements are expected to growth by 32% and 66% by 2050, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision, (ST/ESA/SER.A/366), United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision, Key Findings and Advance Tables. Working Paper No. ESA/P/WP.241., United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in population is expected to increase the volume of wastewater and [[sewage sludge]] requiring treatment. To handle a higher volume of sewage and sewage sludge, it is necessary to upgrade the existing wastewater facilities and the collection networks to collect, store and treat the expected additional volume. Therefore, an increase in volume translates in high future investment costs for a sector that has a low cost recovery rate.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2015). East Asia and Pacific Wastewater to Energy Processes: a Technical Note for Utility Managers in EAP countries, World bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as shown by Mizuta,&lt;ref&gt;Mizuta K., Shimada M. (2010). "Benchmarking energy consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants in Japan." Water Science and Technology '''62'''(10): 2256-2262.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a direct correlation between the volume of sewage treated and the energy consumption of a wastewater treatment plant. Hence, a rise in energy demand is expected with the upgrading of the existing wastewater facilities and the construction of new ones to cope with future population increase.

=== Climate change ===
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have almost doubled between 1970 and 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in greenhouse gases is held responsible for the changes in climate that have caused impacts on natural systems across all continents and oceans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;IPCC (2014). ''Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers''. IPCC Assessment Report. '''5'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, climate change has affected the [[water cycle]], increasing the precipitation intensity and variability, increasing in this way the risks of floods and droughts in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, B. C., Z. W. Kundzewicz, S. Wu and J. P. Palutikof, Eds., 2008: ''Climate Change and Water. Technical Paper of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'', IPCC Secretariat, Geneva, 210 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes that have affected the water cycle have had substantial impacts on the aquatic ecosystems, increasing and worsening the stressors already affecting these systems. Nutrient loading represents one of those stressors as, with the change in precipitation patterns, it is expected a substantial increase in nutrients entering aquatic ecosystems due to increased erosion events and frequent sewage systems overflows. Because wastewater treatment plants discharge the treated wastewater in aquatic [[ecosystem]]s, the target [[Nutrient loading|nutrient load]] of these ecosystems affects the level of treatment that a wastewater treatment plant has to perform on the wastewater before being allowed to discharge it.&lt;ref&gt;Van DijK, A. (2015). "Water resources, climate change and energy". ''Climate, Energy and Water''. C. U. Press''':''' 6-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher native levels of nutrients in the receiving water bodies force wastewater treatment plants to perform more stringent nutrients removal from the wastewater before dispose of it. In addition to stricter discharge limits, future standards for currently unregulated contaminants are most likely to be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell A. S., Hoppock D. C., Webber M. E. (2010). "Energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants in the United States: A case study of the energy-water nexus." ''Sustainability'' '''2'''(4): 945-962.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of more stringent limits and new treatment requirements might further increase the already significant energy demand of these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Venkatesh G., Brattebø H. (2011). "Analysis of chemicals and energy consumption in water and wastewater treatment, as cost components: Case study of Oslo, Norway." ''Urban Water Journal'' '''8'''(3): 189-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population growth and climate change are increasing the energy needs of wastewater facilities. Because [[fossil fuel]]s are still the most diffused source of energy, providing more than half of the global energy needs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3.|title=What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wastewater sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuel-based energy sources. Electricity, for example, is sourced from the electricity [[Grid energy storage|grid]] while gas and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] are generally used on-site for heating and to run backup [[Engine-generator|generators]]. High consumption of [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy makes the wastewater sector an indirect contributor to greenhouse gas emissions since fossil fuels are one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, contributing for 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions globally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resource recovery ===
The pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and the increasing demand for natural resources is compelling the wastewater sector to develop innovative and more efficient practices to operate. Wastewater contains energy, nutrients and other organic and inorganic resources that can be successfully recovered and used in a broad range of applications. Energy can be recovered as [[biogas]]&lt;ref&gt;Askari, Mohammad Bagher, Fatemeh, Golestanian, Saman, Motraz, Motamedi Mirhosseiny, Leili (2015). "Advantages and Disadvantages of Biogas Energy." ''Bulletin of Advanced Scientific Research'' (5): 132-135%V 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwaśny, J., Balcerzak, W.(2017). "Production logistics and participation of biogas in obtaining primary energy in Poland." ''Energy and Environment'' '''28'''(4): 425-436&lt;/ref&gt; and heat.&lt;ref&gt;Funamizu N.,  Iida M., Sakakura Y., Takakuwa T.(2001). "Reuse of heat energy in wastewater: implementation examples in Japan." ''Water Science and Technology'' IWA Publishing '''43''': 277-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kollmann, René, Neugebauer, Georg, Kretschmer, Florian, Truger, Barbara, Kindermann, Helene, Stoeglehner, Gernot, Ertl, Thomas, Narodoslawsky, Michael (2016). "Renewable energy from wastewater – Practical aspects of integrating a wastewater treatment plant into local energy supply concepts." ''Journal of Cleaner Production''&lt;/ref&gt; Biogas is an energy source with a wide range of uses, whereas heat has proven valuable for heating and cooling applications of buildings. Among the nutrients, [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] can be recovered as [[struvite]] for fertilisers, a very important application since phosphate resources are limited and depletable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/lets-talk-phosphorus-depletion/.|title=Let's talk about phosphorus depletion|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composted sewage sludge finds applications in agricultural setting and urban gardens as soil amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Hefa, Xu, Weipu, Liu, Junliang, Zhao, Qingjian, He, Yanqing, Chen, Gang (2007). "Application of composted sewage sludge (CSS) as a soil amendment for turfgrass growth." ''Ecological Engineering'' '''29'''(1): 96-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides energy and nutrients, the effluent from the wastewater treatment plants can be reused as quality irrigation water both in agricultural and landscape applications. The reuse of treated water is especially valuable in countries with limited rainfall events or long periods of [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlosoroff, Saul. (2007). "Wastewater Management, Treatment, and Reuse in Israel". ''Wastewater Reuse–Risk Assessment, Decision-Making and Environmental Security''. M. K. Zaidi. Dordrecht, Springer Netherlands''':''' 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt; All these possibilities are changing the vision of wastewater management and the role of wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater treatment plants have the potential not only to treat the wastewater but also to become resource recovery facilities&lt;ref&gt;Römgens Ben,  Kruizinga Eelco (2013).

Association of Regional Water Authorities, Agentschap NL and DNV.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy ==
Effective strategies adopted by wastewater utilities to reduce energy consumption and dependence from fossil fuel-based energy sources include increasing energy efficiency and generating renewable energy on site.

=== Energy efficiency ===
Since the recognition of anthropogenic causes of climate change in the late 1980s and the identification of the energy sector as one of the main contributors, there has been a global effort to investigate the energy consumption of human activities and their indirect contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe the energy analysis of the wastewater sector was conducted adopting mainly two strategies. Germany (MURL, 1999) and Switzerland (BUWAL, 1994), for example, developed energy management manuals for wastewater treatment plants and reduced their energy consumption by 38% and 50%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wett B., Buchauer K., Fimml C. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuals provided wastewater utilities with energy targets to achieve. On the other hand, in 1999 Austria promoted benchmarking that allowed annual comparison of wastewater treatment plants energy performances. This comparison stimulated a competition among the wastewater treatment plants and the aspiration to improve their efficiency, which led Austria to be one of the first countries in the world to achieve energy neutrality in the wastewater sector. The energy benchmarking process has allowed wastewater treatment plants to identify their most energy-consuming assets and possible inefficiencies, and target them to reduce their energy demand. For example, the inefficiency of the aeration process identified by multiple studies&lt;ref&gt;Belloir C., Stanford C., Soares A. (2015). "Energy benchmarking in wastewater treatment plants: the importance of site operation and layout." ''Environmental Technology'' '''36'''(2): 260-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, O., Keil, S., Fimml, C. (2011). "Examples of energy self-sufficient municipal nutrient removal plants." ''Water Science and Technology'' '''64'''(1): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has allowed the development of more energy efficient oxidation units, with a possible energy saving of about 20% to 50% in some cases according to Frijns&lt;ref&gt;Frijns J., Middleton R., Uijterlinde C., Wheale G. (2012). "Energy efficiency in the European water industry: learning from best practices." ''Journal of Water and Climate Change'' '''3'''(1): 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[EPA Sustainability|EPA]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2013). ''Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater Facilities''. U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
&lt;/ref&gt; study.

=== Renewable energy generation ===
Increased energy efficiency has allowed wastewater treatment plants to comply with discharge limits reducing the energy demand even up to 50%&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; without affecting treatment performances. However, energy efficiency strategies by themselves are not sufficient to achieve independence from the electricity grid and fossil fuel-based energy sources. To achieve energy neutrality, multiple studies have looked at the feasibility of integrating a variety of renewable energy sources into wastewater treatment plants. The wastewater itself is a carrier of energy and a theoretical calculation, based on the characteristic of the sewage, shows that the composition of the embedded energy is 80% thermal energy and 20% chemical energy.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Tarallo (2014). ''UTILITIES OF THE FUTURE ENERGY FINDINGS'', WERF.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal energy can be recovered as heat while the chemical energy is recovered as biogas. 
 
Renewable energy generation on site, in addition to increased energy efficiency, has already allowed at least twelve plants worldwide not only to achieve energy neutrality but also to produce more energy than they need.&lt;ref&gt;Gu Y., Li Y., Li X., Luo P., Wang H., Robinson Z. P., Wang X., Wu J., Li F.(2017). "The feasibility and challenges of energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment plants." ''Applied Energy''&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency programs and renewable energy generation have proven successful in diminishing the dependence of the wastewater sector from the energy grid, reducing treatment costs and the environmental impact associated with the grid connection.

== Advantages of on-site renewable energy generation ==
The production and recovery of energy of site offers numerous advantages contributing to operation and management cost reduction of the treatment processes, source of revenue, contribution to waste management and the cost associated with it and increased resilience in case of power shortage.
 
One of the main advantages of energy generation on site is the less stringent dependence from the electricity grid and the cost mitigation associated with it. Depending on the level of renewable energy generation, wastewater treatment plants can disconnect from the main grid when the electricity is the most expensive, usually during peak hours and simply avoid the more elevated price of these periods. When [[Feed-in tariff|feed in tariffs]] are in place, wastewater treatment plants can sell electricity to the grid and reduce costs through the cost recovery of the sold energy. In some cases, energy utilities offer [https://energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid/demand-response demand response programs], in which a wastewater utility is given a financial incentive if it disconnects when requested by the energy utility. This helps the energy utilities to mitigate energy peak demands reducing the risks of blackout, and it is source of revenue for the wastewater utilities.

In countries where a r[[Mandatory renewable energy target|enewable energy target]] has been introduced, the production of renewable energy allows the wastewater sector to get a certificate for every unit of power they produce. The certificates are then bought by the electricity retailers, that surrender them every year to comply with the renewable energy regulation.

Another advantage of renewable energy production, in specific of [[biogas]] from [[sewage sludge]], is the contribution to waste management. In fact the recovery of the chemical energy involves the reduction of the sewage sludge volume. A smaller volume of sewage sludge is cheaper to transport and dispose of, decreasing operational costs.

Moreover, a diversify portfolio of energy source can contribute to a more resilient response in case of energy shortage and grid problems.

== Barriers to on-site renewable energy generation ==
Despite the numerous advantages offered by on-site renewable energy generation, wastewater utilities are experiencing several difficulties in integrating renewables in their facilities.
 
From a survey conducted by Beca&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BECA|first=|date=November 2015|title=OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE AUSTRALIAN WATER SECTOR|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2016/01/Opportunities-for-renewable-energy-in-the-Australian-water-sector.pdf|journal=Arena|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it emerged that one of the biggest barrier is that energy generation is not core business for wastewater utilities and renewable energy projects come with technical challenges and high initial investment costs. 
Moreover, each plant presents differences and it requires a customised solution for each situation, making it hard to generalise solution for the all sector. There is a lack of guidelines and roadmaps to follow, so each utility has to create specific solutions for their wastewater treatment plants.

The changing price of electricity connected with the fossil fuel price can affect the return time on the investment while the fast changing regulatory panorama increases the uncertainty of the investment and the financial value of it. This can create an unsustainable situation, where  investments in renewables projects can happens only when there are subsidies given by the government.

In the specific situation of biogas production, poor management can increase the fugitive emission of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation.

The '''National Library of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Leabharlann Náisiúnta na hÉireann}}) is the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s [[national library]] located in [[Dublin]], in a building designed by [[Thomas Newenham Deane]]. The [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht]] is the member of the [[Government of Ireland]] responsible for the library.

The mission of the National Library of Ireland is 'To collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual record of the life of Ireland and to contribute to the provision of access to the larger universe of recorded knowledge'

The library is a [[reference library]] and, as such, does not lend. It has a large quantity of Irish and Irish-related material which can be consulted without charge; this includes books, [[map]]s, [[manuscript]]s, music, newspapers, [[periodical]]s and photographs. Included in their collections is material issued by private as well as government publishers.

The [[Chief Herald of Ireland]] and [[National Photographic Archive]] are attached to the library. The library holds [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]s and holds an archive of [[List of Irish newspapers|Irish newspapers]]. It is also the [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] National Centre for Ireland. The library also provides a number of other services including [[genealogy]].

The main library building is on [[Kildare Street]], adjacent to [[Leinster House]] and the archaeology section of the [[National Museum of Ireland]].

==History==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:FrontHall.jpg|thumb|right|190px|"Sapientia" mosaic, front hall]] --&gt;The National Library of Ireland was established by the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act 1877, which provided that the bulk of the collections in the possession of the [[Royal Dublin Society]], should be vested in the then Department of Science and Art for the benefit of the public and of the Society, and for the purposes of the Act.

An Agreement of 1881 provided that the Library should operate under the superintendence of a Council of twelve Trustees, eight of whom were appointed by the Society and four by the Government; this Agreement also conferred on the Trustees the duty of appointing the officers of the Library. This arrangement remained in place until the library became an autonomous cultural institution in 2005.

After the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1924/5 the Library was transferred to the Department of Education under which it remained until 1986 when it was transferred to the [[Department of the Taoiseach]]. In 1927 the Library was granted legal deposit status under the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act 1927. In 1992 the Library transferred to the newly established Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (now Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1993/si/21/made/en/print|date=20 January 1993|access-date=13 August 2018|title=S.I.

'''''Natural Law and Natural Rights''''' is a 1980 book by the philosopher [[John Finnis]]. A restatement of [[natural law]] doctrine, it is considered a seminal contribution to the [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oxf20|Oxford University Press 2013]].&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by [[H. L. A. Hart]] for the Clarendon Law Series.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;[[#Geo05|George 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Finnis argues that social theory cannot be value free and that Humean ethics, unlike genuine (as opposed to neo-scholastic) Thomist ethics, commits a [[naturalistic fallacy]]. He bases his radically rearticulated Aristotelian political and legal theory on dialectically defended first principles of [[practical reason]] and methodological principles of practical reasonableness (morality).&lt;ref name="George" /&gt; He defends the following basic human goods: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability (friendship), practical reasonableness, and religion, defined as "all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence."&lt;ref name="Buckle"&gt;[[#Buc97|Buckle 1997]]. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosophy lecturer Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that Finnis's account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness is more controversial. Buckle sees Finnis's requirement of "respect for every basic value in every act" as intended both to rule out [[consequentialism]] in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the [[Catholic Church]] on a range of contentious issues, including [[contraception]] and [[masturbation]], which in his view undermines its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Buckle" /&gt;

The '''Office of Export Enforcement (OEE)''' is a part of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], [[Bureau of Industry and Security]].

BIS is the principal agency involved in the development, implementation, and enforcement of export controls for commercial technologies and for many military technologies as a result of the President's Export Control Reform Initiative. The Office of Export Enforcement detects, prevents, investigates and assists in the sanctioning of illegal exports of such items. The United States Senate noted this in its report to accompany H.R. 2578, dated June 16, 2015.

OEE's mission is to keep the most sensitive goods out of the most dangerous hands. OEE pursues this mission by enforcing U.S. export control and related public safety laws, with a focus on violations posing the most significant threats to U.S. national and homeland security, foreign policy objectives and economic interests such as the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their delivery systems, international terrorism and State sponsorship of terror, and unauthorized dual-use exports for military purposes.

OEE investigates violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Export Administration Regulations, the Fastener Quality Act, and other export control and public safety statutes; apprehends violators; and works with U.S. Attorneys, BIS's Office of Chief Counsel and other officials in criminal prosecutions and administrative cases based on OEE investigations. OEE Special Agents are criminal investigators who are empowered to make arrests, carry firearms, take testimony, execute search warrants, develop evidence and seize goods about to be exported illegally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/oee Bureau of Industry and Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the U.S. context, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on ''personal''  / ''personally'', and ''identifiable'' / ''identifying''. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. (In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the OECD privacy principles, the term used is more often "personal information", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) "personal information" also includes information from which the person's identity is "reasonably ascertainable", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.)

Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the term "personal data" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol102/iss4/7/|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] Special Publication 800-122&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 800-122|author=|date=|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines PII as "any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information." So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as linked PII.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3.3 “Identifiability”&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the gathering of PII,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and lawmakers{{who|date=April 2013}} have enacted a series of legislation{{which|date=February 2018}} to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

However, PII is a legal concept, not a technical concept, and as noted, it is not utilised in all jurisdictions.

* [[Full name]] (if not common)
* [[Face]] (sometimes)
* [[Address (geography)|Home address]]
* [[Email address]]
* [[National identification number]] (e.g., [[Social Security number]] in the U.S.)

The following are less often used to distinguish individual identity, because they are traits shared by many people.
However, they are potentially PII, because they may be combined with other personal information to identify an individual.

* First or last name, if common
* Country, state, [[postcode]] or city of residence
* Age, especially if non-specific
* [[Gender]] or race
* Name of the school they attend or workplace
* Grades, salary, or job position

When a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as "a 34-year-old white male who works at Target". Note that information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and [[Internet slang]], the practice of finding and releasing such information is called "[[doxing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI's warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored (VIDEO) |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/did-lulzsec-trick-police-arresting-wrong-guy/40522/ |title=Did LulzSec Trick Police Into Arresting the Wrong Guy? - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the "doxed" individual may panic and disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest.ars |title=Doxed: how Sabu was outed by former Anons long before his arrest |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In privacy law==
The U.S. government used the term "personally identifiable" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)&lt;/ref&gt; and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;  The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:

{{cquote|''Information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.''}}

A term similar to PII, "personal data" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;''}}

However, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes—quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In an early draft of the EU [[General Data Protection Regulation]], this was formalized in Article 4, but was omitted in the final version: a "data subject" is one "who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2014-0212+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=Texts adopted - Wednesday, 12 March 2014 - Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data ***I - P7_TA(2014)0212|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] became enforceable on 25 May 2018.

Another term similar to PII, "personal information" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html
| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)
| publisher=California
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''(e) For purposes of this section, "personal information" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, "personal information" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.''}}

The concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from "personal information", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 "personal information", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name [[Placeholder name|John Smith]] has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 "personal information". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 "personal information".&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

The combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic.  However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII.  The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.

According to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is "sensitive", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:

{{quote|"personal information" means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, ''or can reasonably be ascertained'', from the information or opinion. [emphasis added]}}

This raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from core information which say does NOT include a simple name and address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to ascertain who it relates to. Just how much extra effort or difficulty would such a step need before we could clearly say that the identity could NOT be "reasonably ascertained" from it?

{{quote|For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be "reasonably ascertained"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?}}

It appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.
In particular, online behavioral advertising businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.

=== Canada ===
* [[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]] governs the Federal Government agencies
* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]] and similar Provincial legislation governs Provincial Government agencies.
* [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] governs private corporations, unless there is equivalent Provincial legislation
* [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act]] and other similar Provincial legislation governs health information

=== European Union ===
European data protection law does not utilize the concept of PII, and its scope is instead determined by non-synonymous, wider concept of "personal data".

===New Zealand===
The twelve Information Privacy Principles of the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand|Privacy Act 1993]] apply.

=== Switzerland ===

The [[Federal Act on Data Protection]] of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects.&lt;ref name=FADP&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (status as of 1 January 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 18 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The protection is subject to the authority of the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=FADP/&gt;

Additionally, any person may ask in writing a company (managing data files) the correction or deletion of any personal data.&lt;ref name=Amarelle&gt;{{fr}} Cesla Amarelle, ''Droit suisse'', Éditions Loisirs et pédagogie, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company must respond within thirty days.&lt;ref name=Amarelle/&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] (Pub.L. 93–579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted December 31, 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a), a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.

One of the primary focuses of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), is to protect a patient's [[Protected Health Information]] (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the [[Privacy Act of 2005]], which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) [[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]] attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].

U.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) [[Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005]] and (proposed) [[Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005]] each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.

== Forensics ==
In [[forensics]], particularly the identification and prosecution of criminals, personally identifiable information is critical in establishing evidence in [[criminal procedure]]. Criminals may go to great trouble to avoid leaving any PII,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} such as by:
* wearing masks, sunglasses, or clothing to obscure or completely hide distinguishing features, such as [[retinal scan|eye]], skin, and hair colour, facial features, and personal marks such as tattoos, birthmarks, moles and scars.
&lt;!-- Examples regarding physical appearance merged into single bullet

* wearing clothing that covers personal marks such as [[tattoo]]s, [[birthmark]]s, [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] and [[scar]]s. --&gt;
* wearing gloves to conceal [[fingerprint]]s, which themselves are PII. However, gloves can also leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting [[glove prints]], law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sawer |first=Patrick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3740688/Police-use-glove-prints-to-catch-criminals.html |title=Police use glove prints to catch criminals |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[jurisdictions]] the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an [[inchoate offense]].&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;James W.H.

&lt;!-- Weasel-word justification of presence and emotionally purposed statements
* wearing [[gloves]] ([[fingerprint]]s are PII). Since the advent of fingerprint detection, many criminals{{who}} have resorted to the wearing of gloves in order to avoid leaving fingerprints, which thus makes the crime investigation more difficult.

== Personal safety ==
In some professions, it is dangerous for a person's identity to become known, because this information might be exploited violently by their enemies; for example, their enemies might hunt them down or kidnap loved ones to force them to cooperate. For this reason, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of PII of DoD personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] have similar policies, sometimes to the point where employees do not disclose to their friends that they work for the agency.

Similar identity protection concerns exist for [[witness protection]] programs, [[women's shelter]]s, and victims of domestic violence and other threats.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

United States, U.S. Ct. of Appeals, Federal Circuit (1996)| work =4Law School| url =http://www.4lawschool.com/property/pres.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Rail trail}}

Beginning in the 1980s the US government began the Rail to Trails program across the nation to alter defunct [[railroad]] lines into public trails for recreational use.  Since the rise of railroad efficiency and its conglomeration, many lines had become defunct and uneconomical.  In an effort to promote conservation, the government enacted a policy that would turn these lines into recreational trails for hiking, biking, or possibly other activities.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web| title =Preseault v. ICC - 494 U.S. 1 (1986)| work =Justia: US Supreme Court Center| url =http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/494/1/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web| title =Presault v. United States| work =Bloomberg Law| url =http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/property/property-law-keyed-to-dukeminier/private-land-use-controls-the-law-of-servitudes/presault-v-united-states/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Preseault owned the land that a defunct Vermont rail line formerly operated.  The railroad had an [[easement]] on Preseault’s land to operate the line.  In 1970 the rail line became completely unoperated and was left defunct until 1975 when the rail track was dismantled leaving the path only.  However the railroad never officially filed an abandonment order.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

The railroad company had bought the land under a [[fee simple]] contract, meaning they legally owned the land.  However it was an incorrect filing and for all intents and purposes the agreement was treated as an easement and recognized as such by all parties.  Preseault bought the land aware that there was an easement on the land, but believed said easement had been abandoned since the track was dismantled and removed.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

When the Rails to trails program was initiated, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) gained ownership of the line and began refitting the line as a recreational trail without the permission of Preseault.  The ICC, along with the state, believed they still had rights of use under their easement agreement and that using the trail for a new recreational program was not in violation of the easement’s protocol.  A trail was built and hikers and bicyclists began transgressing on Preseault’s property.  Preseault filed a complaint with the ICC stating that his permission was never attained and that he was never compensated.  The ICC refused, stating that the easement of the past railroad line had carried over to its ownership.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

Preseault therefore brought the case to the US Supreme Court in 1986, stating the Rails to Trails program was [[unconstitutional]] and was ruled against.  Preseault eventually sued the federal government and brought his case to the Appellate Court for further review that was finally decided in 1996.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

==Case==
The court first considered if the rights to use the land were under an easement contract, which is how it was effectively used, or if it was under a fee simple, as it nominally was.  In this regard the court found that the railroad had in fact procured an easement and not a fee simple.  The court then deliberated on the nature of the easement.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Easements can be passed from one title holder to another.  However, it generally must follow certain conditions such as: 
#Operations must continue and be unabandoned
#The easement is for a particular purpose and must remain operable only for this same purpose.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

On both of these conditions the court deliberated and made findings crucial to the case.  One, they found that when the railroad dismantled the track in 1975, they had effectively abandoned their right of easement, regardless of having not filed an abandonment order.  Therefore any easement pertaining to the use of this rail track became void.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Secondly the function of the land in question was being used for a different purpose, and therefore could certainly not hold up under easement terms.  Fee simple terms would have permitted this, but the court had already determined that the terms of the contract were certainly under an easement.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

==Decision==
The court found that Preseault’s [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment Rights]], specifically his right of just compensation, had been violated since the land in question was surely his legal property.  The easement had been abandoned by the railroad when it dismantled track and thus it never had the legal right to turn easement rights over to the ICC.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

The Federal Government was required to pay Preseault compensation for the use of the land and seek his explicit permission to use the land under a new easement contract specific to a recreational trail.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; &lt;ref name=4law/&gt;

==Significance==
This case greatly reinforces 5th Amendment rights of citizens and bars the government from transferring easements of land for different purposes without a new contract being created with the property owner.  It also establishes that the intent of a contract, such as between an easement and a fee simple, is significant and may help to alter the findings of a case.  The filing in this instance was incorrectly done and for all intents and purposes was treated as an easement.&lt;ref name=briefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

The '''Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011''' ({{USBill|112|H.R.|1981}}) is a United States [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] designed with the stated intention of increasing enforcement of laws related to the prosecution of [[child pornography]] and [[child sexual exploitation]] offenses. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]] (R-Texas), [[sponsor (legislative)|sponsor]] of H.R. 1981, stated that, "When investigators develop leads that might result in saving a child or apprehending a pedophile, their efforts should not be frustrated because vital records were destroyed simply because there was no requirement to retain them."&lt;ref name="opencongress text"/&gt;

Organizations that support the goal of the bill include the  [[National Sheriffs' Association]], the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] (NCMEC), the [[National Center for Victims of Crime]], and Eastern North Carolina Stop Human Trafficking Now.

H.R. 1981 has been criticized for its scope and privacy implications.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57371426-281/anti-sopa-forces-have-isp-snooping-bill-in-their-crosshairs/ | title=Anti-SOPA forces have ISP snooping bill in their crosshairs | date=3 February 2012 | accessdate=28 February 2012 | last=McCullagh | first=Declan | newspaper=CNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the bill, which include [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and the [[American Library Association]],&lt;ref name="open"/&gt; take issue with the violation of privacy that would necessarily occur if government could compel ISPs to render subscriber information.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|title=The Legislation That Could Kill Internet Privacy for Good|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/the-legislation-that-could-kill-internet-privacy-for-good/242853/|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Bankston]], an EFF staff attorney, stated that "The data retention mandate in this bill would treat every Internet user like a criminal and threaten the online privacy and free speech rights of every American..., ".&lt;ref name=pilot&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Brother heads online|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/07/big-brother-heads-online|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|date=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lamar Smith, Official Portrait, c112th Congress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lamar S. Smith|Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX)]] introduced the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011.]]
On May 25, 2011, [[Lamar S. Smith|Representative Lamar Smith]] of Texas introduced the bill.  It was co-sponsored by 25 other House Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = 112th Congress | title = Bill Summary &amp; Status: HR 1981 | date = May 25, 2011 | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.01981: | work = The Library of Congress | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the United States [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] on July 28, 2011, by a vote of 19-10.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite news | last = Committee on the Judiciary | title = Committee Passes Bipartisan Bill to Protect Children from Child Pornography | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://judiciary.house.gov/news/07282011.html | work = The United States House of Representatives | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2012, the bill had 39 co-sponsors.&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1981/show |title=H.R.1981: Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125080358/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1981/show |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Congressional Budget Office]] report on the costs of enacting the bill was released on October 12, 2011.&lt;ref name="CBO"/&gt; The next step for the bill would be a debate in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

==Scope==
H.R. 1981 would introduce harsher penalties for offenders and make it a crime to financially facilitate the sale, distribution and purchase of child pornography.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; The bill would also amend [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 Section 2703] of the [[Stored Communications Act]], requiring ISPs to retain user IP addresses thereby enabling identification of "corresponding customer or subscriber information" listed in subsection (c)(2) of 18 USC 2703,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 USC 2703|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for at least one year.&lt;ref name="opencongress text"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1981/text | title=Text of H.R.1981 as Reported in House | publisher=Open Congress | accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Retained information would include subscribers' names, addresses, length of service, telephone numbers, and means and sources of payment for services (including credit card or bank account numbers, if they were used to pay for service.) The bill does not introduce limits on subscriber information that may be retained by the ISPs and accessed by the government.&lt;ref name="cnet broadened snooping"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20084939-281/house-panel-approves-broadened-isp-snooping-bill/#ixzz1TRHj2GCD | title=House panel approves broadened ISP snooping bill | work=CNET | date=July 28, 2011 | accessdate=February 4, 2012 | author=McCullagh, Declan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also protects ISPs from civil actions resulting from the loss of data stored as a requirement of the bill.&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozer|first=Nicole|title=Bill Harming Online Privacy Moving Through Congress|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/bill-harming-online-privacy-moving-through-congress|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill also requires the Attorney General to conduct studies related to the costs of compliance for service providers as well as the compliance standards implemented by service providers. The cost assessment would include hardware, software, and all personnel involved in the compliance and the compliance assessment would include a survey of the privacy standards implemented by the providers and the frequency of reported breaches of data.

Use of the data ISPs would be forced to retain under the bill would not be limited to investigations of child pornography, but would be available for law enforcement perusal for any issue, but only with probable cause and a warrant. However, issues involving unregistered sex offenders would allow for the use of an [[administrative subpoena]], which is different from a warrant or judicial subpoena, and which does not require probable cause.&lt;ref name= "Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill text on thomas.loc.gov|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1981:|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill does not grant the right to access subscriber records to any "person or other entity that is not a governmental entity."

The bill also does not provide extra funding to investigate or prosecute additional child pornography related cases.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt;

==Purpose==
On July 12, 2011, the Sheriff of Bedford County, VA, provided [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321155614/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf testimony on H.R. 1981] before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. In his testimony, Brown claimed that the growth of technology and the ability to claim anonymity has "enabled child pornography to become a worldwide epidemic" and made it more difficult for law enforcement to identify and prosecute child predators. Brown further reasoned that an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) could retain client records for a limited span of time, ranging from a couple hours, days, or weeks, and that a lack of uniformity across ISPs "significantly hinders law enforcement's ability to identify predators when they come across child pornography." He then provided an actual account of when his county received a cybertip from the NCMEC involving an individual who posted that they were exposing themselves to a toddler. The only information he claimed law enforcement possessed was the [[IP address]] that was accessing a YAHOO [[Chat room]] through an [[nTelos]] wireless connection. During the investigation, law enforcement discovered that the ISP only retained the [[Media access control]] address and IP history for 30 days, a limit that foreclosed their opportunity to access investigative material. 
&lt;ref name="Testimony"&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Hearing on "H.R. 1981 - Protecting Children From Internet  Pornographers Act of 2011"|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|publisher=Congress|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321155614/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCEMC, which created CyberTipline over a decade ago, reported that, "To date, more than 51 million child pornography images and videos have been reviewed by the analysts in NCMEC's Child Victim Identification Program" and it is estimated that  "[Forty] percent or more of people who possess child pornography also sexually assault children" and H.R. 1981 "equips federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with the modern-day tools needed to combat the escalation in child pornography and child exploitation crimes." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt281/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt281-pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by critics including the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], that H.R. 1981 was framed as a child protection measure at least in part to make it more difficult for members of Congress to reject the bill.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaste|first=Martin|title=Child Pornography Bill Makes Privacy Experts Skittish|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/24/139875599/child-pornography-bill-makes-privacy-experts-skittish|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

==Privacy issues==
Various groups have expressed concerns over the privacy implications of the data providers would be required to retain under the act,&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Meredith|first=Leslie|title=Child porn law could affect everyone's privacy|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46563165/ns/technology_and_science-security/#.T055vIcgemQ|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=MSNBC|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="open"/&gt;  Concerns raised include the security of the data from a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]],&lt;ref name=pcw&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=Advocacy Group Takes Aim at Anti-Porn Bill|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/250803/advocacy_group_takes_aim_at_antiporn_bill.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=IDG News|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nature of the data collected,&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt; as well as the potential for misuse by law enforcement, or use in investigations that are not child pornography-related.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=tnw&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Adhikari | title = Privacy: Can an Anti-child Porn Bill Go Too Far? | date = September 12, 2001 | url = http://www.technewsworld.com/story/73259.html | work = Technology News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though only assigned IP addresses and certain subscriber data would be retained, some commenters, including the EFF and some editorialists, have suggested that the data could be used to deduce any given user's personal habits, including a detailed map of where they customarily are at any given point in a day.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Rainey|title=How Internet Companies Would Be Forced to Spy on You Under H.R. 1981|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/how-internet-companies-would-be-forced-spy-you-under-hr-1981|publisher=EFF|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDT also issued a comprehensive memorandum regarding the Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981, in which it detailed how data retention provisions in H.R. 1981 would raise issues concerning privacy and free speech, among the few other issues that the bill raises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum on Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981|url=http://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/CDT_Letter_HR1981.pdf |publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Zoe Lofgren]], (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the bill, presented an amendment to rename the bill the "Keep Every American's Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act."&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news | first = Leslie | last = Harris | title = The 'Just in Case You're a Criminal Someday' Act | date = August 9, 2011 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/minority-report-precrime-real-house-bill-online-life/story?id=14258575 | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rep. [[John Conyers]] (D-Mich.) also opposed it, saying "This is not protecting children from Internet pornography. It's creating a database for everybody in this country for a lot of other purposes."&lt;ref name="cnet broadened snooping" /&gt; She also argued that the bill's pertinence to "commercial" ISPs would allow criminals to circumvent legislation if they used the Internet anonymously in venues including Internet cafes or libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman Smith Stmt at Markup of H.R. 1981, the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act|url=http://m2m.tmcnet.com/news/2011/07/28/5667208.htm|publisher=M2M Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar Smith, however, has defended the data retention requirements present in the bill in stating that, "Some Internet service providers currently retain these [IP] addresses for business purposes. But the period of retention varies widely among providers, from a few days to a few months. The lack of uniform data retention impedes the investigation of Internet crimes." Smith also stated that the number of child pornography cases has grown by 150% per year over the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = 2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center has gone on record for saying that
"the bill's expansion of data retention is counter to the growing practice to limit data retention as 
a mechanism to counter security threats." In addition, Rotenberg also mentions that in fact, there is a strong movement towards minimization of data retention in the information security arena, and data retention is in direct conflict with that notion. Rotenberg concluded that data minization and not data retention is the best way to protect consumer privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Policy Report|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=2407296421&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=31810&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|publisher=Aspen Publishers, Inc.|accessdate=4 April 2012|author=Brian Hammond|authorlink=Child Protection Bill's Mandate on data Retention Sparks Concerns|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
On October 12, 2011 a report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] on the financial impact of the bill was released.&lt;ref name=CBO&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1981, Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act Cost estimate for the bill as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on July 27, 2011|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12476/hr1981.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This report stated that the cost to the government would be minimal and that the private companies providing Internet services would pay over $200 million in costs. Costs would include servers for storage of the user data.&lt;ref name="CBO"/&gt;

The Center for Democracy and Technology has issued a report suggesting that the cost of data retention would be much higher than the Congressional Budget Office report indicates, and would grow prohibitively expensive with ongoing trends in internet addressing.&lt;ref name=cdt&gt;{{cite web|title=Compliance with a Data Retention Mandate – Costs Will Skyrocket with  Trends in Internet Addressing|url=https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/data%20retention%20memo%202-1-12.pdf|publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar legislation==
H.R. 1981 is similar to Canada's [[Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act]] which "requires Internet providers to acquire the ability to engage in multiple simultaneous interceptions and gives law enforcement the power to audit their surveillance capabilities. Should it take effect, the bill would create a new regulatory environment for Internet providers, requiring them to submit a report within months of the law taking effect describing their equipment and surveillance infrastructure. Moreover, they would actively work with law enforcement to test their facilities for interception purposes and even provide the name of employees involved in interceptions to allow for possible RCMP background checks." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Geist|title=Bill C-30 opens Canada to Big Brother Inc. business|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/1136406--bill-c-30-opens-canada-to-big-brother-inc-business-geist|work=online news article|publisher=thestar.com|location=Toronto|date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=April 2014}}'''Public law'''  is that part of [[law]] which governs relationships between individuals and the [[government]], and those relationships between individuals which are of direct concern to [[society]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Public law comprises [[constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], [[tax law]] and [[criminal law]],&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all [[procedural law]]. In public law, [[Default rule|mandatory rules]] prevail. Laws concerning relationships between individuals belong to [[private law]].

The relationships public law governs are asymmetric and unequal – government bodies (central or local) can make decisions about the rights of individuals. However, as a consequence of the [[rule of law]] doctrine, authorities may only act within the law (''secundum et intra legem''). The government must obey the law. For example, a citizen unhappy with a decision of an administrative authority can ask a court for [[judicial review]].

[[Rights]], too, can be divided into ''private rights'' and ''public rights''. A paragon of a public right is the right to [[welfare|welfare benefits]] – only a [[natural person]] can claim such payments, and they are awarded through an administrative decision out of the [[government budget]].

The distinction between public law and private law dates back to [[Roman law]]. It has been picked up in the countries of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law tradition]] at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but since then spread to [[Common law (legal system)|common law countries]], too.

The borderline between public law and private law is not always clear in particular cases, giving rise to attempts of [[Jurisprudence|theoretical]] understanding of its basis.

==Public law in civil law and common law jurisdictions==
{{See also|Magna Carta}}

[[Rule of law]], the idea that the administration of the state should be controlled by a set of laws, originated in [[Greek Antiquity]] and was revitalized by modern philosophers in France ([[Rousseau, Jean Jacques|Rousseau]]), Germany ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) and Austria in the 18th century. It is related to the strong position of the central government in the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], and was inspired by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. It developed hand in hand with the creation of [[civil code]]s and [[criminal code]]s.

==Areas of public law==

=== Constitutional law ===
In modern states, [[constitutional law]] lays out the foundations of the state. Above all, it postulates the supremacy of law in the functioning of the state – the [[rule of law]].

Secondly, it sets out the form of government – how its different branches work, how they are elected or appointed, and the division of powers and responsibilities between them. Traditionally, the basic elements of government are [[Executive (government)|the executive]], [[Legislature|the legislature]] and [[Judiciary|the judiciary]].

And thirdly, in describing what are the basic [[human rights]], which must be protected for every person, and what further [[civil and political rights]] citizens have, it sets the fundamental borders to what ''any'' government must and must not do.

In most jurisdictions, constitutional law is enshrined in a written document, the [[Constitution]], sometimes together with amendments or other constitutional laws. In some countries, however, such a supreme entrenched written document does not exist for historical and political reasons – the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] is an unwritten one.

=== Administrative law ===
'''[[Administrative law]]''' refers to the body of law which regulates bureaucratic managerial procedures and defines the powers of administrative agencies. These laws are enforced by the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of a [[government]] rather than the [[judiciary|judicial]] or [[legislature|legislative]] branches (if they are different in that particular jurisdiction). This body of law regulates [[international trade]], [[manufacturing]], [[pollution]], [[tax]]ation, and the like. This is sometimes seen as a subcategory of [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] and sometimes seen as public law as it deals with regulation and public institutions

=== Criminal law ===
'''[[Criminal law]]''' involves the state imposing sanctions for defined crimes committed by individuals or businesses, so that society can achieve its brand of [[justice]] and a peaceable [[social order]].

==Theoretical distinction between private and public law==
In German-language legal literature, there is an extensive discussion on the precise nature of the distinction between public law and private law. Several theories have evolved, which are neither exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive or separate from each other.

The '''interest theory''' has been developed by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] jurist [[Ulpian]]: "''Publicum ius est, quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem.'' (Public law is that, which concerns Roman state, private law is concerned with the interests of citizens.) The weak point of this theory is that many issues of private law also affect the public interest. Also, what exactly is this public interest?

The '''subjection theory''' focuses on explaining the distinction by emphasizing the subordination of private persons to the state. Public law is supposed to govern this relationship, whereas private law is considered to govern relationships where the parties involved meet on a level playing field. This theory fails in areas commonly considered private law which also imply subordination, such as [[labour law|employment law]]. Also, the modern state knows relationships in which it appears as equal to a person.

The '''subject theory''' is concerned with the position of the subject of law in the legal relationship in question. If it finds itself in a particular situation as a public person (due to membership in some public body, such as a state or a municipality), public law applies, otherwise it is private law.

A '''combination of the subjection theory and the subject theory''' arguably provides a workable distinction. Under this approach, a field of law is considered public law where one actor is a public authority endowed with the power to act unilaterally (''imperium'') and this actor uses that ''imperium'' in the particular relationship. In other words, all depends whether the public authority is acting as a public or a private entity, say when ordering office supplies. This latest theory considers public law to be a special instance.

There are areas of law, which do not seem to fit into either public or private law, such as [[labour law|employment law]] – parts of it look like private law (the employment contract), other parts like public law (the activities of an employment inspectorate when investigating workplace safety).

The distinction between public and private law might seem to be a purely academic debate, but it also affects legal practice. It has bearing on the delineation between competences of different courts and administrative bodies. Under the [[Austrian constitution]], for example, private law is among the exclusive competences of federal legislation, whereas public law is partly a matter of [[States of Austria|state]] legislation.

'''Scott Greenall''', (born January 16, 1973) is an artist from [[Garden Grove, California]]. Although suffering from [[Cerebral Palsy]] since birth,&lt;ref name="Ward2005-04-15"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ward | first = James | date = April 15, 2005 | title =Musician uses disability for inspiration  | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/visaliatimesdelta/access/1785196641.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+15%2C+2005&amp;author=James+Ward&amp;pub=Visalia+Times+-+Delta&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.11&amp;desc=Musician+uses+disability+for+inspiration | newspaper = [[Visalia Times-Delta]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 he started a small [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] recording studio in his grandparents' garage.

Though Greenall was a musician from an early age, he opened the studio to learn the art of recording by recording bands from all around the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. In 1993 Greenall produced and recorded a full-length album for Real-Eyes titled "Contagious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | work = Real Eyes | url = http://myrealeyes.com/aboutus.html | accessdate = February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, (1993) he recorded and engineered a [[7"]], [[Extended play|EP]]. titled "What I Can't Have" for [[Plaid Retina]]. Greenall closed the recording studio to the public in late 1996.

Scott Greenall used his experience as a [[recording engineer]] / producer to craft and nurture his own sound and material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/scottgreenall/music/songs Scott Greenall's sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

Starting in 1997, Scott Greenall began performing live.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/visaliatimesdelta/access/1747493021.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+20%2C+2006&amp;author=&amp;pub=Visalia+Times+-+Delta&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.10&amp;desc=Greenall+to+perform+in+Visalia/ Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; One show he performed in [[Orange County, California]], caught the eye of film producer, Kevin Ragsdale, who, in 2004, cast Scott Greenall to perform a song that Greenall wrote titled, "I'm Never Going Away"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TgREP8_eXo  Scott Greenall performance from The Curse Of El Charro]&lt;/ref&gt; in the feature-length film, "[[The Curse of El Charro]]".&lt;ref name="Ward2005-04-15" /&gt; The movie introduced Scott Greenall"s artistic stylings to a whole new public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boropulse.com/2006/10/halloween-offerings/ Boro Pulse article]&lt;/ref&gt; Greenall gave a remarkably eerie performance in a scene that literally feels like [[David Lynch]] had stepped in for a moment to direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://horrornews.net/63060/film-review-the-curse-of-el-charro-2005/ Horror News movie review]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] / [[Showtime Networks|Showtime]] cable vision, as well as DVD,&lt;ref&gt;[https://amazon.imdb.com/title/tt0401271/ DVD release]&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed worldwide.

In 2006, film director / composer, Rich Ragsdale, directed a music video for Scott Greenall. The video was produced by KNR-Productions for a song Greenall wrote titled "All The Love in the World Can't Save You Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Music Videos | work = K N R Productions | url = http://knr-productions.com/ | accessdate = February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diq2plqVLp4/ All The Love In The World Can't Save You Now music video]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the '''investment company products/variable life contracts representative exam''', is commonly referred to as the '''Series 6 exam'''. Individuals passing this multiple choice [[exam]] are licensed to sell a limited set of [[securities]] products:
* [[Mutual fund]]s
* [[Closed-end fund]]s on the initial offering only
* [[Unit investment trust]]s
* [[Annuity (finance theory)|Variable Annuities]]

A Series 6 registered individual is not a [[stockbroker]] since Series 6 license holders cannot sell [[stock]], other [[preferred stock|corporate securities]], [[direct participation program]]s (DPPs), or [[option (finance)|option]] products.

This exam is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA, previously known as the NASD). In order to take the exam, an individual must be sponsored by a member firm of either FINRA or a [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO). The cost of the exam is $100.00. Individuals are allowed two hours and fifteen minutes to complete 100 multiple choice questions. The passing score is 70%, and those who fail this exam must wait thirty days before taking it again.

The table below lists the allocation of exam questions for each main job function of an investment company and variable contracts products representative.

'''Singaporean nationality law''' is derived from the [[Constitution of Singapore]] and is based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' and a modified form of ''[[jus soli]]''. There are three ways of acquiring Singaporean [[citizenship]]: by birth, by descent, or by registration. 

==History of Singaporean citizenship==
{{British subjects}}

Singaporean citizenship was first granted in 1959 when [[Singapore]] was a [[self-governing colony]] of the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]]. At that time, Singapore had already been granted full internal self-government.  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance 1957 provided Singaporean citizenship to all residents who were born in Singapore or the [[Federation of Malaya]], British citizens who had been resident for two years, and others who had been resident for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepoer|first=Barbara Leitch (ed.)|title=Singapore : A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1989|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704220519/http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm|archivedate=2014-07-04|df=}}, ch. 10 ("Road to Independence").&lt;/ref&gt; Singaporeans were still considered [[British subject]]s at that time, and their passports had the unusual nationality status of "British subject: citizen of the State of Singapore" instead of the usual "British subject: citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=209&amp;secid=204 |title=History of Travel Documents &amp; Passes |publisher=ICA |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225062053/http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=209&amp;secid=204 |archivedate=2013-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  There are treaties signed by the [[United Kingdom]] during this period specifically mention this unusual nationality status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1961/TS0083.pdf |title=Exchange of Notes between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Finland regarding the Abolition of Visas for travel between the United Kingdom and certain British Territories, and Finland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123534/http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1961/TS0083.pdf |archivedate=2018-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005355/1960-04-10|title= Notawisseling tussen de Nederlandse en de Britse Regering inzake de afschaffing van de visumplicht en de erkenning van reisdocumenten, Londen, 01-04-1960|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180208064157/http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005355/1960-04-10|archivedate= 2018-02-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Singaporean citizens became [[Malaysia]]n citizens on 16 September 1963 upon Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia|merger]] with Malaysia on that date. [[Malaysian nationality law]] provided that Singaporean citizenship to continue to exist as a subnational citizenship. Singaporean citizenship continued to be legislated by the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore]], subject to the approval of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]]. Singaporean citizenship was inseparable from Malaysian citizenship; in other words, it was not possible to have Singaporean citizenship without having Malaysian citizenship.

Upon Singapore's secession from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singaporean citizens. Singaporean nationality law was incorporated into the new [[Constitution of Singapore]]. The constitution repealed the 1957 Ordinance, and all persons who were citizens as of 16 September 1963 by virtue of the Ordinance continued to be Singaporean citizens.

The Constitution was amended in 2004 to allow female citizens and citizens by descent to transmit their citizenship to children born overseas. For this to occur, citizens by descent must satisfy certain residency requirements.

==Citizenship by birth==
A person is a Singaporean citizen by birth if he or she is born in Singapore with at least one parent who is a Singaporean citizen provided both parents are registered officially as legally married.

However, a child whose father is a foreign diplomat who enjoys [[diplomatic immunity|immunity]] in Singapore will not be granted Singaporean citizenship even if his or her mother is Singaporean. The gender-specific language of this clause allows an unusual scenario where a child born in Singapore whose mother is a foreign diplomat and whose father is Singaporean will obtain Singaporean citizenship by birth but not if the gender roles are reversed.

==Citizenship by descent==
A person born outside Singapore on or after 15 May 2004, with at least one parent who is a Singaporean citizen, is a Singaporean citizen by descent. If the parent from whom the child derives citizenship is a Singaporean citizen by descent, the parent must have been resident in Singapore for a total of at least five years before the child's birth or a total of at least two years out of the five years immediately preceding the child's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On citizenship by descent in Singapore|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/xiamen/consular_services/citizen.html|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Consulate General of the Republic of Singapore|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220141855/http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/xiamen/consular_services/citizen.html|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person born outside Singapore before 15 May 2004 will be a Singaporean citizen by descent only if his or her father was a Singaporean citizen by birth or by registration at the time of birth.

If the parent from whom the child derives citizenship is a Singaporean citizen by registration, the child will be granted Singaporean citizenship by descent only if they do not acquire citizenship of the country of their birth.

==Citizenship by registration==
Registration is the term used in the Constitution to refer to the process commonly known as naturalisation. A person can apply for registration as a Singaporean citizen if he or she has been a [[Permanent residency in Singapore|Permanent Resident]] for at least two years and is gainfully employed or married to a Singaporean citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits and drawbacks for a citizen in Singapore|url=https://www.3ecpa.com.sg/services/immigration/singapore-citizenship/|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=3ecpa|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208040148/https://www.3ecpa.com.sg/services/immigration/singapore-citizenship/|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male Permanent Resident may also apply upon satisfactory completion of full-time [[National Service]], as may children of Singaporean citizens resident in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=132&amp;secid=130 |title=Apply for Singapore Citizenship |publisher=ICA |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307222654/http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=132&amp;secid=130 |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each application is considered on its own merits.

==Citizenship by naturalisation==
Although provided for in the Constitution, citizenship by naturalisation is no longer granted.&lt;ref name="wwlegal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwlegal.com/module-subjects-viewpage-pageid-14.html|title=Citizenship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021205654/http://www.wwlegal.com/module-subjects-viewpage-pageid-14.html|archivedate=October 21, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government instead uses the constitutional provision for citizenship by registration to grant citizenship to residents.

==Dual citizenship==
The position of the Singapore Government is that dual citizenship is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heng |first=Janice |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/microsites/parliament/story/dual-citizenship-not-right-now-govt-will-keep-open-mind-dpm-teo-20130307 |title=Dual citizenship not right for now, but Govt will keep an open mind: DPM Teo |publisher=Straitstimes.com |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223152909/http://www.straitstimes.com/microsites/parliament/story/dual-citizenship-not-right-now-govt-will-keep-open-mind-dpm-teo-20130307 |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws regarding Singapore citizenship are found in the Constitution of Singapore.

A dual citizen may have acquired citizenship by birth in a foreign country, by descent from a foreign citizen parent, or by naturalisation. Singapore citizens who voluntarily and intentionally acquire citizenship of a foreign country after the age of 18 may be deprived of their Singapore citizenship by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Article 134(1)(a) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners who naturalise as Singaporean citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.&lt;ref&gt;Article 126(1) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who are born outside of Singapore and have at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen may register with a Singapore consulate within a year to acquire Singapore citizenship by descent. However, such persons must renounce their foreign citizenship, if any, before reaching 22 years of age. The Constitution of Singapore is silent on a Singapore citizen who acquired citizenship by birth and is a foreign citizen by descent. So long as such a person refrains from exercising the rights of foreign citizenship, the Government has no grounds for depriving him of his Singapore citizenship and he may hold on to dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 122(4) and 126(3) for Singaporean citizens by descent and registration respectively, no provision for Singaporean citizens by birth&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship even though they may feel a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Immigrants who have been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenship may be reluctant to become naturalized citizens as it would mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries.

The government argues that authorising its citizens to concurrently hold foreign nationalities would be undesirable since, due to Singapore's geopolitical position, it cannot afford to allow its citizens multiple allegiances which may be compromised in times of national crisis. The government also fears that those without a second citizenship may feel aggrieved if dual citizens enjoy the benefits of citizenship during periods of wealth but leave the country in trying times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Siew Ying|title=Singapore Won't Go the Path of Dual Citizenship: SM Goh|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/149776/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=2005-05-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204624/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/149776/1/.html|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the government is open to the possibility of allowing dual citizenship if local and global circumstances demand so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paulo|first=Derrick A.|title=Time Not Ripe for Dual Citizenship|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/today20060824-2.2.5.2.aspx|publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=2006-08-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103205705/http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/today20060824-2.2.5.2.aspx|archivedate=2014-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renunciation of citizenship==
Citizens of Singapore can only renounce Singaporean citizenship if they have acquired citizenship of another country. At the time of renunciation, renunciants must submit their [[Singaporean passport]]s and [[National Registration Identity Card]]s for cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/sanfrancisco/SGrenounce.html|title=ITEMS TO NOTE FOR RENUNCIATION OF SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225021204/http://www.mfa.gov.sg/sanfrancisco/SGrenounce.html|archivedate=December 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2011, about 1,200 Singaporean citizens renounce their citizenship every year, 300 of them are naturalised citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2012/02/29/1200-renounce-their-citizenship-every-year/|title=1,200 renounce their citizenship every year - ASEAN/East Asia {{!}} The Star Online|last=|first=|date=2012-02-29|website=www.thestar.com.my|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509034534/https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2012/02/29/1200-renounce-their-citizenship-every-year/|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male Singaporeans cannot renounce citizenship until completing national service; however, exceptions are made for males who emigrated at a young age. In 2012, a Hong Kong-born teenager filed a lawsuit regarding this requirement in order to give up his citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = K.C.

==Commonwealth citizenship==
All Singaporean citizens are [[Commonwealth citizen]]s and are entitled to certain rights in the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. For example, they can vote in all elections (including for the [[European Parliament]]), hold public office and serve on juries in the UK. However, Singaporean citizens do not receive consular assistance from British embassies in non-Commonwealth countries without a Singapore representative unlike other Commonwealth nations, owing to the Singapore government's option not to afford Singaporeans this privilege.

These rights include:

* the right, unless otherwise disqualified (e.g. imprisoned), to vote in all elections (i.e., parliamentary, local and European&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp06/aff/cp060070en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Judgments of the Court in Cases C-145/04 and C-300/04 – Kingdom of Spain v United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland |publisher=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816231131/http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp06/aff/cp060070en.pdf |archivedate=August 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; elections) as long as they have [[Elections in the United Kingdom#Registration procedure|registered to vote]] (they must possess valid [[leave to enter|leave to enter/remain]] or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|not require such leave]] on the date of their electoral registration application&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Act 1983, Section 4(6)&lt;/ref&gt;)
* the right, unless otherwise disqualified, to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons]] as long as they possess [[indefinite leave to remain]] or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|do '''not''' require leave]] under the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) to enter or remain in the UK
* the right, if a qualifying peer or bishop, to sit in the [[House of Lords]]
* eligibility to hold public office (e.g., as a judge, magistrate, minister, police constable, member of the armed forces, etc.)

==Travel freedom==

In 2018, Singaporean citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 189 countries and territories, ranking the [[Singaporean passport]] second in the world according to the [[Henley Passport Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php |title=Passport Global Ranking |accessdate=2018-06-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606191223/https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php?ccode=sg |archivedate=2017-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Syntagma Canonum''''' is a canonical collection made in 1335 by [[Matthew Blastares]], a Greek monk about whose life nothing certain is known. 
The collector aimed at reducing [[canon law]] to a handier and more accessible form than it appeared in the [[Nomocanon]] of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], and to give a more comprehensive presentation than the epitomes and synopses of earlier writers such as Stephen (fifth century), Aristenus (1160), Arsenius (1255), et al. The author arranged his matter in [[alphabet]]ical order. He made 24 general divisions, each marked off by a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. These sections he subdivided into 303 titles, themselves distinguished by letters; for example, the third section contains such topics as: ''peri gamou'' (about marriage), ''peri gynaikon'' (about women), etc. The titles ordinarily treat of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (''nomoi politikoi''), as well as [[ecclesiastical law]]. Some titles however are purely ecclesiastical, others purely civil. The church ordinances are quoted from previous collections, especially from the [[Nomocanon]] (883), while the extracts from the civil law are for the most part transcribed without any reference to their origin. The compilation soon came into general use among the [[clergy]], and preserved its authority even under Ottoman rule. A translation into [[Serbian language|Serbian]] followed close upon its first publication. It even worked its way into the political life of the Serbian people through an abridgment which Serbian [[Emperor Dušan]] appended to his code of laws (1349). From this the purely ecclesiastical enactments were excluded, but the civil law contained in the Syntagma was reproduced whenever adaptable to the social condition of the people. In the sixteenth century the Syntagma Canonum was translated into [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]; in the seventeenth century into [[Russian language|Russian]].

The '''Vagabonds Act 1597''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] (39 Eliz. c. 4). 

The moving force behind the bill was probably Mr Secretary, Robert Cecil who wrote his policy in ''Notes for the Parliament'' on the basis of a speech to be made on November 5th.  The Ninth Parliament of Elizabeth's reign had opened on October 24th, 1597, and it promised to be one of its most productive.  Cecil was concerned that the dearth of corn, high prices, rising homelessness, and "the lamentable cry of the poor, who are like to perish" was causing considerable distress, riot and even rebellion: in London alone there were an estimated 10,000 vagabonds; and 2,000 in Norwich.&lt;ref&gt;F G Emmison, ''Elizabethan Life: Disorder'', (Essex County Council, 1970) p.200-202&lt;/ref&gt;   During 1597 the harvest failed causing widespread suffering and hardship: many thousands were made unemployed by the enclosures which compounded the effects of the famine.  One MP [[Sir Francis Hastings]] remarked defined the term 'vagabond' calling for them to be arrested, whipped and returned to their place of origin where they would be set to work in a House of Correction.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Maitland, "Sixteenth Century Poverty And Elizabethan Legislation", unpublished, Worcester College of Education, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Despite local variations in provision, vagrancy continued to be a national problem.

Cecil promoted the three bills to follow, supported mainly by Puritans.  However a majority of the gentry in the Commons rebelled against the social measures; one of these was the flamboyant [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;J.E.Neale, Elizabeth I: and her Parliaments 1584-1601, Jonathan Cape, London, 1957, p.348-349&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 1597, Chairman of the Grand Committee, [[Sir Robert Wroth]], seconded by [[Henry Finch]], both Puritans three of the greatest pieces of Elizabethan legislation.  In December the bill was read for a second time (''secunda vice'') before being kicked upstairs to the Lords.  In Grand Committee it received many amendments, and likewise from the Lords.  The bill caused considerable debate in both houses.  However the two houses could not agree how categories of prisoner were to be described.  On the third reading in the Commons the bill was rejected on a division by 106 votes to 66.  Under Elizabethan procedure, the Lords drafted a compromise bill which passed both houses with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Simond D'Ewes, Lords Journal, vol.ii, pp.203-220.&lt;/ref&gt;  It introduced [[penal transportation]] as a punishment for the first time. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], it has been estimated that 72,000 people were executed.&lt;ref name="1911EB"&gt;''1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Capital punishment''&lt;/ref&gt;  With the establishment of settlements in [[North America]], an alternative practice (seemingly borrowed from [[Spain]]) began of a reprieve of the death sentence should the condemned person consent to be transported to an American colony, and be entered into bond service.&lt;ref name="1911EB"/&gt; However, it is probable that this part of the legislation was never put into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/transportation/transp1.html Sources in the National Archives for research into the transportation of Irish convicts to Australia (1791-1853) : Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Another effect of the Act was to lessen the severity of a punishment meted out to strolling players imposed under a 1572 act wherein "all fencers, bearwards, common players of interludes, and minstrels (not belonging to any baron of this realm, or to any other honourable person of greater degree)," wandering abroad without the license of two justices at the least, were subject "to be grievously whipped and burned through the gristle of the right ear with a hot iron of the compass of an inch about." &lt;ref&gt;''''1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Theatre''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relief of the Parish Poor remained in force down to 20th Century, the third act to pass in 1597 was an Act to erect Hospitals and 'working houses for the poor' that became the basis for the Victorian workhouse system; and another was the Act for "the punishment of rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars".  Rogues who escaped were arrested, branded and then returned to the House of Correction until the 'governer' could decide when to obtain their release.  Since many vagabonds took refuge in these areas, the main change brought in by the act at Clause 3 was the stipulation that vagrants or 'sturdy beggars' should be sent back to their place of origin.  They were viewed by Parliament essentially as being migrants, and therefore should be returned from whence they came.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, p.360, 376 n4.&lt;/ref&gt; The act required every parish to keep a record of every resident, including potential vagrants, who might go wandering across the realm.  Unfortunately most of this information was only available in the larger cities.  The paucity of quality record-keeping meant it was difficult to interpret how population increases reflected upon rising vagrancy rates during 'The Dearth' of 1590s.  The act insisted the "wandering" and "loitering" was designated into two social groups of unskilled poor and unemployed economic migrants: however as no person was forced to "wander" it was thus interpreted as falling hardest on the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;Vagrancy Act (Acts of the Privy Council, 1597-8, pp. 388-9&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; 1596-7, x629-30, and 1647-8 were years of high grain prices. {{cite book | editor-first = J. | editor-last = Thirsk | title = The Agrarian History of England and Wales | volume = vol.IV, 1500-1640 | location = Cambridge | year = 1967 | pages= 820–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These acts were lasting testaments to Elizabethan religious radicalism that were among the most profound of the many reforms of the period.{{efn| for example, the Mayor of Exeter had to make provision for those sick from the plague in 1587, 1591, and 1598; and Winchester in 1593; Salisbury suffered similarly from an influx of population.  In both 1591 and 1605 after the acts were passed the City Fathers had to raise Special [[Poor Rates]].}}  These were violent times.  There were riots and plague in London in 1592, and then in 1596 an armed uprising in Oxfordshire.  The Queen's fears and apprehensions were exaggerated by the enclosure acts that drove sheep onto the land, and peasants off it, as described to her by John Manwood in his treatise ''A Brefe Collection of the Lawes of the Forest'' (1592); they circumscribed the royal prerogative.{{efn| vividly portrayed in Shakespeare's fictional comedies ''As You Like It'' and ''Love's Labor's Lost''.}}  The Midland counties of thick afforested areas, such as the [[Forest of Arden]] were more disorderly, unruly and more likely to have livestock than the lowland arable areas.  The poor would "dwell in woods ...like drones devoted to thievery," whereas "the forests, if inclosed, would be more secure for travellers,...and more beneficial for the Commonwealth."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hill, ''The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas during the English Revolution (New York: Viking, 1975, p. 41. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pettit, ''The Royal Forests of Northamptonshire: A Study in their Economy, 1558-1714'' Gateshead: Northumberland Press, 1968, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference gave rise to David Underdown's 'chalk and cheese' description citing immigration, price instability, dearth, and social instability as main factors leading to vagabondage and vagrancy among the lower orders driving out by informal rough justice.  The cow pasturage thus represented a border area with woodlands of lawlessness and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = John | last = Walter | title = A 'Rising of the People'? The Oxfordshire Rising of 1596 | journal = Past and Present | volume = vol.107 | year = 1985 | pages = 90–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marxist historians Christopher Hill and Sharp, have argued that the violence was syptomatic of organized angry resistance mobilised in the iron founding areas, turning out weaponry from secret 'hideaways'.  They have contended that far from passive acceptance of their starving condition, the poor sought to fight back against the callous landlords.  The foresters were "addicted to crime and violence - all rogues."&lt;ref&gt;As You Like It and the Enclosure Riots, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish vagrants travelled in bands like a circus, and often assumed the title "gypsies" which was affected.  There is little evidence of gangs of aggressive beggars roaming Elizabethan England, except in as much as "gentlemen of the road" and other soubriquet are mentioned in Shakespeare's legendary works.  Informative though it was, much of the literature was based on the romanticism of the Robin Hood, as the lawless vagabond and thief.  In one clause beggars were punished for 'subtle crafts' proscribing [[palmistry]], [[fortune-telling]], [[minstrelling]] or [[unlicensed acting]], most often associated with illiterate itinerant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Dean | title=Law-Making and Society in Late Elizabethan England: The Parliament of England, 1584-1601 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the English tended to travel in ones and twos frequenting along the way at familiar haunts, such as a refreshment house, barn, or lodging-house.  No Gaming was allowed and the Innkeepers were expected too keep a good house.  The Quarter Sessions were a binding cognizance against "harbouring rogues, vagabonds and others without passports."&lt;ref&gt;Emmison, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically young adults, predominantly men, either looking for work or engaged in petty crime.  Officials prescribed that they "deserved to be whipped or stocked" as a punishment for transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;P.R.O. SP i6/388/7(xxiv, xxxvii), TNA&lt;/ref&gt;  Those that were not punished were integrated into town life "to save the town harmless."  Towns suffered from relatively high mortality rates, and so new 'blood' was always welcomed to boost numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, p.367&lt;/ref&gt;  By the Jacobean Parliament of 1610 it was noted that "thieves, rogues and beggars" had threatened local populations by coming out of the woods, from whence they had earlier taken refuge in times of The Dearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = E. R. | editor-last = Foster | title = Proceedings in Parliament i 6i o | location = New Haven | volume = vol.I | page = 966; II, 28 I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also made those listed in several categories liable for [[impressment]] in the service of the fleet.  Jacobean statute reversed the requirement to send people home, perhaps in recognition of a New World circumstance in which Transportation helped to satisfy demands for colonists.  Indeed Australian law has traced the origins of the commutation of labour to Macquarie Harbour down to the 1597 act and a Privy Council decision of 1602.  When “lesser offenders adjudged by law to die” [to] be punished instead in a manner that will correct them “and yield a profitable service to the Commonwealth in parts abroad...”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last= Langbein|title=The Historical Origins of the Sanction of Imprisonment for Serious Crime|journal= Journal of Legal Studies|volume=vol. 5|year= 1976|pages= 35–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vagabond Act 1597 was repealed by section 28 of the [[Vagrants Act 1713]].

{{Voting images}}

'''Voting''' is a method for a group, such as a meeting or an [[Constituency|electorate]], to make a collective [[decision making|decision]] or express an opinion, usually following discussions, debates or [[election campaigns]]. [[Democracy|Democracies]] elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called "constituents", and those constituents who cast a [[ballot]] for their chosen candidate are called "voters".  There are different systems for collecting votes.

== In politics ==
In a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives in its government.
In a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.

A vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].

Voting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.

=== Electoral systems ===
{{Voting}}
{{main|Voting system|Election}}
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes are organised about four times a year.]]
Different [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.

A side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].

To understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed "up for election", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.

&lt;!-- Needs attention ↓ --&gt;
A development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat first-past-the-post. This sytem is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.&lt;ref&gt;[[Majority rule]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometime less than 50%, and the rules for participation to the runoff may vary.

An alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% or more votes than the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.

In a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.

In a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.

In a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].

Some "multiple-winner" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.

=== Referendums ===

Most of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche économique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.

=== Fair voting ===
{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}
Results may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference—they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that the most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favor.

There are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.

=== Negative voting ===

{{Main|Disapproval voting}}

Negative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.

Under this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.

Consider the following example:

Three candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.

'''Election results with positive voting:'''

A-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.  B-voters, unconfident of their candidate's chances, split their votes exactly in half, giving both Candidates A and C 15% each.  C-voters, also logically vote for their candidate.  A is the winner with 55%, C at 45% and B 0%.

'''Election results with negative voting:'''

A-voters again, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A. B-voters again, split exactly in half. Each B-voter decides to vote negatively against their least favorite candidate, with the reasoning that this negative vote allows them to express approval for the two other candidates.  C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.

=== Proxy voting ===
{{Main|Proxy voting}}
Proxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.

=== Anti-voting ===
{{Main|Abstention}}

In [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the "[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

Other social movements in other parts of the world also have similar campaigns or non-voting preferences. These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.

It is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.

=== Voting and information ===
Modern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]–[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ([http://wikisum.com/w/Lupia_and_McCubbins:_The_Democratic_Dilemma Summary])&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Predicting%20Elections%20from%20politicians%20faces.pdf | title = Predicting Elections from Politicians’ Faces | author = Kesten C.

[[Christadelphians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], [[Rastafarians]], the [[Assemblies of Yahweh]], and some other [[Religious denomination|religious group]]s, have a policy of not participating in politics through voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Meetings and gatherings==
Whenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.

=== Voting basis ===
{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.

The voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404–405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electoral systems}}
{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}
A '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.

==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==
{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}
[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]—bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]—use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.

==Voting methods==
{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}

===Paper-based methods===
The most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.

[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]
An alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]].

===Machine voting===
{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}

Machine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online voting===
In some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postal voting===
Many countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.

===Open ballot===
In contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].

===Other methods===
In [[Gambia]] voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].

===In person===
{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}
Some votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present. This could be by a show of hands or [[keypad polling]].
